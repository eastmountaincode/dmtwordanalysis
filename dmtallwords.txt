about
two
months
ago
i
obtained
two
grams
of
dmt
i
was
elated
after
several
years
of
searching
for
it
i
had
really
wanted
it
in
the
first
place
but
had
settled
for
various
other
dialkyl
tryptamines
over
the
past
3
years
which
had
brought
me
a
wealth
of
interesting
and
amazing
experiences
i
tried
a
couple
of
moderately
succesful
yage
journeys
which
had
shown
me
the
potentials
of
the
mindspaces
available
through
dmt
but
i
have
been
perhaps
a
little
cowardly
about
inflicting
the
physical
effects
of
yage
on
myself
again
though
i
longed
to
visit
the
mental
territory
again

the
package
arrived
one
sunny
april
morning
when
i
had
a
day
off
i
loaded
a
joint
with
a
small
dose
of
the
white
freebase
powder
and
sparked
it
an
immediate
warm
buzzing
around
my
neck
and
shoulders
followed
the
bite
of
the
harsh
smoke
on
my
lungs
and
my
vision
gently
morphed
with
fine
horizontal
seams
like
a
venetian
blind
each
band
tinting
reality
either
red
green
or
blue
in
alternating
order
intuitively
i
felt
a
sense
of
potential
power
and
significance
although
as
the
experience
quickly
dissipated
i
was
strongly
aware
of
the
taste
of
plastic
and
protests
of
my
long
suffering
lungs

five
minutes
or
so
afterwards
an
old
friend
from
whom
i
had
not
heard
for
years
phoned
out
of
the
blue
to
say
they
were
moving
abroad
i
had
heard
talk
about
synchronicities
on
chatboards
etc
before
but
i
tend
to
the
skeptic
side
on
such
matters
in
my
thoughts
about
why
i
have
an
interest
in
the
matter
of
psychedelics
i
take
the
view
that
you
have
to
seperate
clearly
in
your
mind
the
normal
workaday
life
of
a
21st
century
westerner
and
the
dreamworld
that
psychedelics
can
reveal
i
dont
believe
in
ghosts
and
ufos
etc
during
normal
life
i
remain
a
little
wary
of
those
believers
with
a
glint
in
their
eye
who
abandon
their
lives
completely
to
the
pursuit
of
one
conspiracy
or
another
but
when
i
am
under
the
influence
of
psychedelic
drug
at
a
sufficient
dose
the
dream
state
i
occupy
appears
to
have
certain
rules
and
parameters
which
are
different
to
those
of
the
lucid
state
whether
or
not
the
word
real
can
be
used
in
reference
to
a
state
where
these
different
parameters
apply
is
a
moot
point
when
i
am
in
such
a
state
i
may
as
well
interact
with
it
if
only
in
the
interest
of
knowledge
or
novelty

in
the
afternoon
i
bought
a
glass
pipe
with
a
little
side
hole
and
some
vials
from
the
local
head
shop
with
this
new
equipment
i
determined
to
explore
further
i
put
some
dry
tobacco
in
the
body
of
the
pipe
along
with
some
spice
and
held
it
over
a
candle
to
heat
the
pipe
i
made
several
attempts
like
this
with
varying
successes
i
often
complicated
the
lift
off
by
worrying
about
the
safety
of
the
candle
flame
i
found
music
distracting
a
singers
voice
would
be
morphed
into
a
metalic
jabbering


these
first
journeys
were
brief
and
hard
to
integrate
the
rapidity
of
the
visions
was
such
that
only
the
general
tenor
of
the
content
was
discernable
it
seemed
to
have
a
sinister
tone
consisting
of
images
such
as
playing
cards
flashing
by
skulls
military
hardware
screws
at
one
point
a
vicious
gun
turret
on
the
back
of
a
plane
with
jutting
machine
barrels
just
a
quick
image
frame
amongst
many
the
almost
instant
passing
of
this
phase
was
followed
by
a
warm
womb-like
phase
where
i
did
not
have
any
technicolour
realist
visions
just
the
warm
reds
of
the
bright
ceiling
light
through
my
closed
eyelids
across
which
seam-like
waves
folded
and
divided
i
had
experienced
an
almost
identical
state
as
this
latter
phase
using
4
aco-dmt
and
felt
very
comfortable
in
this
subjective
state
i
often
feel
like
i
am
in
the
presence
of
a
benevolent
god
to
whom
i
feel
it
is
only
right
to
thank
for
all
the
good
things
in
life
and
to
send
out
good
wishes
to
all
my
loved
ones
i
then
feel
a
little
guilty
and
send
out
good
wishes
to
all
the
people
i
dont
love
finally
i
feel
very
virtuous
all
round


when
back
in
the
sober
state
my
skeptic
brain
has
a
good
laugh
at
these
religious
epiphanies
this
is
what
i
like
about
psychedelics
they
let
me
experiment
with
possibilities
which
in
the
real
world
are
not
possibilities
for
example
the
question
what
might
it
be
like
to
burst
a
sack
full
of
dimensions
on
your
head
is
a
subject
of
metaphysical
speculation
but
under
the
influence
and
you
might
be
lucky
enough
to
participate
in
some
kind
of
encounter
where
this
actually
appears
to
take
place

i
often
found
myself
swaying
gently
with
my
arms
folded
and
a
warm
smile
over
my
face
almost
bowing
to
the
universe
in
satisfied
bliss
i
took
one
hit
in
the
kitchen
at
the
back
of
my
house
overlooking
our
back
garden
which
has
many
pleasant
trees
some
still
in
blossom
the
good
sunshine
that
evening
gave
the
foliage
a
translucent
light
in
the
kitchen
i
heated
the
pipe
over
the
gas
hob
the
disadvantage
of
my
method
seemed
to
be
that
it
led
to
quite
some
wastage
i
needed
to
cover
the
side
hole
on
the
pipe
to
achieve
a
stronger
negative
pressure
which
results
in
a
more
effective
vapourisation
however
the
pipe
was
hot
to
touch
and
so
again
i
was
approaching
the
jump
with
a
cluttered
mindstate
i
managed
two
tokes
holding
the
last
in
but
not
convinced
of
its
adequacy
i
kept
my
eyes
open
holding
steady
on
the
kitchen
units
while
seated
on
a
tall
stool
the
surge
began
and
i
watched
the
kitchen
units
dancing
before
my
eyes
sliding
along
left
to
right
in
outline
form
neon
coloured
reds
blues
and
greens
i
looked
at
the
cooker
whose
control
surface
would
duplicate
along
all
the
units
flickering
back
and
forth
then
i
looked
at
the
microwave
on
the
work
surface
who/which
was
also
indulging
in
these
strange
diplays


immediately
i
beheld
the
sudden
exchange
of
pulses
or
spurts
of
neon
energy
between
it
and
the
gascooker
at
this
point
i
had
to
laugh
a
little
i
had
a
sense
that
this
performance
was
for
my
benefit
somehow
there
had
been
some
comedic
element
which
had
struck
a
chord
in
me
and
just
seemed
absolutely
hilarious
i
remember
thinking
that
if
my
mrs
had
walked
in
i
would
have
pointed
at
what
i
was
witnessing
and
said
would
you
look
at
that


quite
unselfconsciously
as
though
it
was
there
to
see
plain
as
daylight

i
began
to
surmise
that
my
technique
was
probably
flawed
and
wasteful
the
pipe
became
quite
grubby
i
didnt
want
to
wash
away
remnants
of
the
previous
burn
but
i
knew
that
the
remnants
would
quickly
degrade
anyway
exposed
to
air
i
was
getting
toward
the
end
of
my
spice
as
well
so
i
made
further
dispatches
to
arrakis
to
whom
the
people
of
which
culture
i
am
eternally
indebted
in
the
knowledge
of
almost
certain
replenishment
i
decided
to
purchase
a
more
effective
pipe
and
make
the
best
of
what
was
left
to
me
at
that
time
i
found
a
light
bulb
style
vapouriser
which
matched
the
prescription
perfectly
at
a
penny
under
a
£5
from
the
headshop
its
ease
of
use
has
led
me
to
imagine
using
it
to
try
vapourising
some
other
tryptmines
all
in
salt
form
unf
such
as
4-aco
dmt
and
dpt

this
vapouriser
i
tested
in
the
kitchen
over
a
hob
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
because
i
had
been
chewing
over
the
sinister
tone
some
of
the
visions
i
had
experienced
i
wondered
if
that
was
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
and
that
by
getting
a
really
big
chestfull
i
was
only
going
to
submerge
deeper
into
something
sinister
that
i
did
not
want
to
see
i
could
not
reconcile
this
fear
with
the
wonderfull
blissful
sense
of
being
i
was
experiencing
in
the
afterglow
i
wondered
if
it
was
some
part
of
myself
that
i
was
genuinely
scared
to
look
at
the
voice
of
logic
reminded
me
that
whatever
happens
is
over
almost
as
quickly
as
it
begins
and
that
gave
me
a
sense
of
strength
going
in

the
heat
melted
the
light
yellow
tinted
crystals
into
a
colourless
pool
which
gathered
in
the
bottom
of
the
bulb
i
watched
white
vapour
uncoiling
around
the
glass
as
the
bulb
became
opaque
i
drew
slowly
one
long
potent
lungful
and
as
i
did
so
the
vapour
billowed
more
furiously
my
tongue
and
lips
numbed
and
my
respiratory
plumbing
stung
a
little
as
i
filled
up
eyes
opened
i
placed
the
still
billowing
bulb
down
on
a
cold
hob
and
turned
the
heat
off
as
i
did
this
the
room
tinted
yellow
sepia
and
i
shut
my
eyes
looking
for
a
slide
show
i
was
immediately
disappointed
just
the
womblike
state
with
some
extra
patterning
but
then
the
warm
crescendo
of
buzzing
both
audible
and
physical
spread
through
my
neck
and
shoulders
followed
by
a
very
slight
crack
or
snap
from
somewhere
in
my
auditory
canal


for
a
short
while
i
was
not
strictly
local
i
dont
remember
events
as
such
just
a
sensation
of
being
somewhere
in
between
my
kitchen
and
the
dreamworld
then
this
absence
of
self
was
burst
by
a
small
patch
of
vivid
vision
like
the
view
through
a
tiny
hole
in
the
wall
of
a
darkened
room
out
on
to
the
scene
on
a
bright
summer
day
i
thought
i
saw
a
snippet
of
rows
of
parked
cars
like
the
us
guzzlers
of
the
50s
with
their
chromed
wings
or
maybe
it
was
an
orderly
residential
scene
i
gasped
involuntarily
startled
by
the
many
implications
of
this
vision
the
stylistic
appearance
of
the
scenes
were
partly
culturally
familiar
and
at
the
same
time
slightly
skewed
i
was
startled
out
of
phase
with
the
vision
but
i
was
exhilarated
and
back
in
the
afterglow
where
i
began
giving
praise
to
the
universe
for
what
i
could
only
formulate
as
the
privelege
of
what
i
had
seen


the
question
of
intentionality
came
up
again
in
my
mind
it
felt
like
i
had
been
shown
these
things
by
the
big
whatever
i
gently
swayed
on
the
stool
and
basked
in
the
beautiful
concept
that
the
universe
was
far
more
bizarre
and
comedic
than
i
could
ever
have
imagined
i
had
gasped
at
the
ontological
ramification
that
i
might
have
seen
another
world
or
a
parallel
universe
i
felt
certain
for
a
few
moments
inside
that
i
had
seen
proof
that
worlds
and
culture
not
particularly
unlike
our
own
or
sharing
certain
evolutionary
or
environmental
parameter
existed
and
there
might
even
be
many
of
them
this
was
not
the
kind
of
revelation
that
transposes
well
into
conversation
so
i
kept
my
council
to
myself
my
mrs
does
not
approve
of
my
little
hobby
very
much
but
for
all
the
right
reasons
because
she
cares
about
me
so
i
dont
recite
her
my
adventures

the
general
effect
of
all
this
dmt
smoking
has
been
strangely
positive
i
am
conscious
of
the
power
of
suggestion
in
potentially
shaping
the
experiences
we
have
after
all
i
think
it
was
hume
who
surmised
that
we
are
the
sum
of
our
experiences
i
felt
almost
virtuous
not
to
have
witnessed
entities
which
could
be
described
as
self
transforming
machine
elves
though
that
is
not
to
say
i
was
in
any
position
to
doubt
the
subjective
truth
of
these
descriptions
but
i
had
felt
what
seemed
to
me
divine
pressence
and
visualised
abstract
entities
in
the
wide
mind
space
of
closed
eyes
with
a
strong
light
source
and
i
had
witnessed
something
that
had
startled
me
to
the
core
of
me
being
in
a
deeply
satisfying
way
although
i
could
not
fathom
its
significance
it
could
have
been
many
possible
or
impossible
things
and
called
to
mind
a
reality
along
the
lines
of
michael
moorcocks
multiverse

i
also
noticed
a
sense
of
well
being
in
general
life
which
i
have
heard
reported
and
subsequently
may
be
a
result
of
preconditioning
however
this
sense
seems
so
tangible
and
yet
natural
as
to
be
too
good
to
be
true
i
found
a
part
of
me
thinking
that
everyone
should
have
a
blast
with
this
stuff
at
least
once
a
cliché
i
know
i
also
imagined
the
possibility
of
a
worldwide
pyramid
selling
scheme
by
which
an
alien
race
might
prepare
humanity
for
contact
this
tickled
me
since
in
my
newfound
openess
to
the
parameters
of
altered
space
such
a
conspiracy
might
be
impossible
to
disprove
i
felt
heightened
empathy
with
even
the
people
i
perhaps
disliked
and
tangible
antidepressant
effect
not
that
i
am
generally
depressive
these
days
but
there
is
something
to
this


i
would
only
complain
that
my
chest
has
been
taking
a
beating
there
is
a
strange
logic
that
it
appears
that
the
more
effective
a
hit
i
achieve
the
less
troublesome
my
chest
is
i
cough
up
some
chunks
in
the
aftermath
and
the
taste
doesnt
offend
me
anymore

my
next
consignment
arrived
a
week
after
that
final
excursion
excitement
boiling
over
i
prepared
myself
for
more
adventures
i
was
faced
with
a
dilemma
the
experience
i
felt
honestly
in
my
heart
was
a
good
thing
as
far
as
i
could
see
it
seemed
to
open
my
mind
on
a
spiritual
level
which
chimed
morally
with
the
parts
of
my
anglican
upbringing
which
i
still
respect
and
the
buddhist
ideas
i
had
been
reading
about
recently
it
gave
me
exhilarating
journeys
and
imaginings
which
i
somehow
wished
i
could
record
or
describe
and
would
be
grist
to
any
mind
with
a
soft
spot
for
science
fiction
i
also
sensed
somehow
the
experiences
constituted
a
revealing
or
an
uncovering
due
to
the
perception
of
continuity
between
trips
something
might
be
captured
in
my
memory
in
one
experience
and
in
the
next
one
i
might
seek
to
hone
in
on
that
image
and
it
might
blossom
itself
into
many
possibilities
it
was
an
ongoing
discourse
between
me
and
the
drug


however
it
is
expensive
to
obtain
and
woefully
illegal
i
cant
see
how
it
can
be
legal
like
tobacco
or
beer
its
just
too
powerful
i
was
pretty
scared
by
what
seemed
hellish
imagery
in
the
early
part
of
my
experiences
and
it
almost
seemed
to
be
warning
me
off
i
dont
like
to
break
the
law
i
only
do
so
in
relation
to
weed
and
my
research
i
dont
speed
and
i
am
at
peace
with
myself
most
of
the
time
morally
i
had
been
reading
about
alan
watts
a
religious
academic
and
buddhist
who
at
one
point
said
when
you
have
got
the
message
hang
up
the
phone
in
relation
to
psychedelics
i
agreed
with
those
words
but
certain
that
i
had
not
yet
got
the
message
i
certainly
wanted
to
see
more

with
this
in
mind
i
decided
to
explore
the
current
two
gram
i
had
and
order
five
which
i
would
package
and
freeze
with
the
other
samples
for
some
distant
future
time
when
i
felt
the
urge
i
had
a
hunch
that
this
might
be
just
short
window
of
availability
and
that
the
privelege
of
this
opportunity
might
soon
be
gone

i
had
bought
a
gas
turbo
lighter
to
provide
a
safe
but
effective
heat
source
if
for
whatever
reason
you
let
go
of
it
it
goes
out
so
that
the
possibility
of
dying
from
burns
just
as
you
are
on
the
brink
of
universal
knowledge
is
avoided
furthermore
it
starts
the
vaporisation
very
quickly
and
you
can
reduce
the
heat
if
your
throat
is
hurting
by
increasing
the
flame
distance

i
got
comfy
on
a
very
soft
chair
in
my
converted
garage
i
had
strong
spotlights
on
the
ceiling
pointed
to
my
head
these
help
embolden
the
colours
of
the
closed
eye
visuals
giving
garish
hues
to
the
visual
field
i
loaded
a
100mg
hit
and
started
the
flame
beginning
to
inhale
slowly
once
the
vapours
rose
i
must
have
managed
a
long
cool
slow
breathful
because
i
was
able
to
calmly
hold
it
in
for
what
seemed
like
a
very
long
time
i
was
able
to
dispose
of
the
bulb
and
lighter
in
a
civilised
fashion
and
close
my
eyes
expectantly
my
self
was
dissolved
again
after
a
short
cavalcade
of
pageantry
and
carnival
of
which
i
was
no
longer
fearful
but
i
was
again
non
local
or
in
dimensional
interstices

to
the
right
of
my
mind
space
was
a
blue
mass
a
large
entity
formed
of
layers
of
strata
and
bejewelled
with
many
crystals
along
geometric
fault
lines
which
folded
twisted
and
morphed
its
form
in
a
mechanical
fashion
was
alongside
of
me
the
blue
colour
was
around
the
entity
like
an
amniotic
sack
i
moved
my
mind
towards
it
and
i
burst
into
the
sack
which
fell
away
enough
for
the
entity
and
myself
to
make
some
kind
of
contact
it
was
a
light
green
to
yellow
colour
underneath
the
sack
suspension
of
disbelief
obligatory
at
this
point
i
sensed
a
blue
sheen
spreading
over
my
own
body
which
was
rigid
but
gently
juddering
with
a
fine
tremor
similar
to
which
i
have
experienced
with
dpt
i
also
became
aware
that
i
was
pulsing
and
stretching
thythmically
besides
the
fine
tremor
matching
the
oscillations
of
the
entity
to
my
right
when
i
did
so
in
phase
with
it
the
spaces
between
the
strata
of
its
twisting
form
widened
and
the
jewels
inside
showed
even
more
vivid
crystal
surfaces
it
was
through
these
surfaces
i
again
glimpsed
the
strange
world
which
i
had
seen
that
previous
time
the
more
my
body
matched
the
entitys
dance
the
greater
one
of
these
crystal
windows
became
filling
my
minds
eye
and
almost
breaking
through
into
the
scene
beheld


a
sunny
1950s
suburban
street
somewhere
far
across
the
universe
this
phase
of
physical
movement
and
intense
vision
was
accompanied
by
a
strange
sensation
of
flashes
of
sudden
coldness
which
intuition
told
me
was
something
to
do
with
interacting
with
the
entity
although
i
did
not
fear
for
my
life
or
any
extreme
drama
it
was
enough
to
distract
me
and
the
consciousness
of
my
visitors
diminished
i
was
still
in
the
far
off
state
and
spent
some
minutes
swaying
and
basking
in
the
moments
of
grace
my
eyes
remained
closed
however
though
i
occasionally
flashed
a
look
at
the
room
around
which
neon
sparks
flitted

to
integrate
this
experience
i
resolved
to
wrap
up
warm
for
my
next
attempt
and
to
follow
the
dance
of
the
entity
if
i
dared
i
had
begun
to
entertain
the
possibility
that
the
entity
might
in
fact
be
using
my
curiousity
to
lure
me
into
contact
there
might
be
no
doorways
into
other
universes
just
beings
using
extensive
kitsch
simulations
of
such
worlds
to
lure
psychonauts
for
their
own
mysterious
ends
this
might
explain
the
slightly
skewed
stylistic
tone
of
the
visions
i
also
had
to
acknowledge
there
was
an
almost
sexual
angle
to
these
encounters
a
feature
i
had
noted
on
several
occasions
when
i
had
used
heroic
doses
of
4
aco
dmt
i
also
became
aware
about
how
much
dancing
and
physical
conditions
play
a
part
in
the
shamanic
phenomenon
using
what
i
had
learned
i
was
able
to
reproduce
a
very
similar
experience
the
dance
lasted
perhaps
longer
and
i
persevered
the
cold
spells
so
that
i
got
a
clearer
view
into
the
crystal
that
i
locked
onto
i
noticed
that
all
the
other
crystals
feature
a
simillar
scene
which
might
have
been
slightly
different
like
cinema
film
stock
i
couldnt
tell
since
i
could
only
look
closely
through
one
crystal
at
a
time


the
entity
itself
is
hard
to
describe
in
great
detail
it
had
something
akin
to
an
inca
or
aztec
architectural
influence
combined
with
the
opulence
of
a
wedding
cake
except
that
it
could
rotate
twist
and
shuffle
like
a
rubic
cube
in
this
latter
trip
i
noticed
a
neon
green
amniotic
sack
along
with
the
original
blue
one
i
was
familiar
with
i
did
not
have
a
chance
during
the
time
available
to
explore
the
possibilities
with
that
entity
though
i
sensed
it
was
of
a
species
with
the
first
as
i
returned
to
consensus
reality
i
sent
my
now
habitual
prayers
out
and
wished
all
souls
well
i
decided
to
hang
up
the
phone
for
a
while
until
i
had
been
able
to
record
and
describe
some
of
what
i
had
been
able
to
experience
there
was
still
much
i
wanted
to
try
i
had
still
not
gone
for
the
infamous
third
toke
i
had
grudgingly
come
to
understand
the
term
self
transforming
machine
elves
with
greater
intimacy
i
have
been
amazed
by
how
this
drug
is
so
specific
and
unspecific
at
the
same
time
and
how
difficult
the
game
of
memory
can
be
when
the
recollection
of
what
occurred
evaporates
like
a
dream
at
wakening

because
of
the
similarity
i
have
noticed
between
the
post
breakthrough
phase
of
dmt
and
my
experience
of
a
good
dose
of
4aco-dmt
i
am
speculating
about
using
the
aco
ester
as
a
springboard
into
the
dmt
space
i
have
not
got
round
to
this
yet
nor
a
journey
which
i
am
postulating
using
5g
101
white
caapi
extract
i
have
to
permit
oral
ingestion
at
the
moment
i
am
happy
to
vapourise
due
to
the
compact
timescale
i
am
not
considering
the
nasal
route
or
plugging
since
i
have
the
freebase
and
both
routes
are
reputedly
unpleasant
although
i
am
not
too
squeamish
generally

this
stuff
is
both
humbling
and
exalting
it
shows
me
how
little
i
really
know
about
the
universe
and
realty
but
gives
a
sense
of
joy
at
the
small
part
i
play
in
it
and
it
seems
to
do
this
with
its
tongue
in
its
cheek
for
which
it
seems
a
reassuring
and
hopefull
thing
to
my
mind
all
the
best
-
peace
and
love

this
is
a
rather
long
account
of
two
extremely
potent
experiences
with
two
forms
of
dmt
followed
by
an
account
of
the
same
experience
by
another
participant/witness



--
pharmahuasca
was
what
they
were
calling
it

two
75
mg
harmaline
tablets
mao
inhibitor
with
four
10mg
5-meo-dmt
chasers
totalling
40mg

what
the
hell
i
thought
im
in
the
jungles
of
mexico
in
palenque
im
surrounded
by
experienced
psychonauts
at
a
ethnobotanical
conference
whats
the
worse
that
can
happen

be
prepared
to
die
our
source
told
me
grimly
earnest

yeah
i
thought
like
a
major
mushroom
trip
right

i
felt
i
was
ready

not
quite

in
all
there
were
nine
of
us
forming
a
circle
in
one
of
our
rooms
with
mattresses
and
pillows
laid
out
for
all
of
us

my
brother
sat
across
from
me

two
of
the
nine
were
experienced
with
ayahuasca
and
become
our
leaders

before
consumption
each
one
of
us
stated
our
intent
out
loud
or
to
ourselves

mine
was
to
experience
spiritual
consciousness

rather
vague
this
being
my
first
time
with
this
class
of
substance

unsure
of
how
long
to
wait
between
harmaline
and
5-meo
we
decided
20
minutes
should
be
plenty

later
we
were
told
the
quantities
were
designed
for
simultaneous
consumption
of
the
both
the
harmaline
and
5-meo
tablets

some
of
us
took
the
entire
dose
some
took
half

i
was
24
510
115
lbs
and
decided
to
take
the
entire
dose
being
my
first
and
perhaps
only
opportunity

when
in
doubt
double
the
dose
to
quote
terrence
mckenna
a
well-loved
experienced
shroomer

oops

the
effects
of
the
harmaline
were
subtle
energizing
like
a
betelnut
buzz

20
minutes
later
i
ingested
all
four
5-meo
dmt
tablets

what
follows
is
both
from
memory
and
the
account
of
others

it
came
in
waves

strong
soporific
deep
intoxicating
waves
building
in
intensity
like
watching
storm
waves
build
up
on
shore

stronger
stronger
stronger

some
of
us
started
chanting
singing

some
softly
moaned
with
pleasure
or
insight

i
felt
queasy
nervous
not
quite
nauseous
at
this
point

i
remained
silent
focusing
on
my
breathing
to
calm
myself

i
started
trembling
cold
gradually
warming
up
feeling
her
the
spirit
of
ayahuasca
calling
wanting
to
take
me

i
felt
myself
slowly
giving
in
retreating
giving
in
unsure
of
where
i
was
headed

what
have
i
got
myself
into
i
asked
myself

this
was
not
what
i
expected
at
all
this
was
much
much
much
deeper
and
unlike
anything
id
ever
experienced
x
mushies
lsd
thc

this
was
only
the
beginning
i
was
soon
to
learn
the
experience
had
not
really
started
fully
yet

i
laid
down
on
my
pillows
and
draped
my
arm
over
my
eyes
to
block
out
the
candle
light

it
was
around
11pm
when
we
started

i
remained
focused
on
my
breathing
staring
into
the
black
of
my
arm
feeling
my
brain
my
mind
sink
into
a
warm
absolute
void
outside
of
my
body

i
was
so
focused
on
my
breathing
i
didnt
notice
the
void
at
first
and
when
i
did
i
sat
up
with
a
start
then
slowly
settled
back
down
trying
to
ease
myself
into
it



the
first
waves
of
nauseousness
started
to
creep
up
on
me
and
i
increased
my
breathing
rate
deeper
harder
almost
to
the
point
of
hyperventilation
until
the
experience
had
drawn
me
even
further
in

i
started
to
sink
sink
sink
through
my
body
through
the
ground
my
body
going
limp
numb

my
breathing
was
still
strong
hard
almost
frantic
obvious
to
everyone
around
me

i
was
losing
my
connection
with
my
body
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
if
i
was
breathing
enough
or
too
much

my
thinking
mind
my
inner
voice
began
to
fade
i
couldnt
concentrate
on
words
but
rather
only
abstractions
of
very
deep
complex
ideas

i
just
knew
things
without
thinking
them

like
ideas
were
being
fed
directly
to
me

from
me

my
breathing
rate
increased
approaching
hyperventilation
without
my
realizing
it
at
first

one
of
the
leaders
crept
up
to
me
silently
with
auga
florida
rose
water
which
he
sprayed
across
my
chest
and
face
from
his
mouth

i
started
to
snap
back
and
became
aware
of
my
breathing
but
seemed
unable
to
control
it

he
laid
his
chest
on
mine
follow
my
breathing
he
said
and
forced
my
chest
to
breathe
with
his

i
relaxed
slowed
my
breathing
became
more
aware
of
my
surroundings
pulled
back
from
the
black

he
retreated
back
to
his
mat
and
rather
quickly
i
fell
right
back
into
the
inky
black
void
like
a
deep
dreamless
waking
sleep
drifting
swimming
sinking

i
drifted
for
what
felt
like
an
eternity
my
mind
disassociating
deeper
deeper
the
deepest
of
dreamless
sleeps

it
lasted
for
an
eternity
me
swimming
in
and
out
of
it
vaguely
aware
numb
drugged


and
then
i
woke

i
sat
up
and
everyone
around
my
was
laying
down
quiet
still
seemingly
asleep

some
stirred
or
twitched
like
coming
down
from
x
or
shrooms
while
trying
to
sleep

it
was
over

it
felt
like
4-6
hours
had
passed
and
i
felt
extremely
rested
aware
awake

it
appeared
lighter
out
dawn
was
approaching
it
seemed

there
was
a
slight
crackling
of
energy
around
me
visual
hallucinations
of
colored
points
of
light
in
a
static
textile/grid-like
pattern
similar
but
different
from
shrooms

i
looked
at
my
watch

only
15
minutes
had
passed

uh
oh
i
thought

that
was
just
the
beginning
the
first
wave

i
wasnt
sure
quite
what
to
do

lay
down
walk
around
what

i
stood
up
and
nervous
anxiety
started
to
creep
up
on
me

i
pushed
it
away
annoyed
at
my
seeming
inability
to
get
into
it
relax
let
it
take
me

open
eye
visuals
seemed
stronger
but
still
vague

when
i
closed
my
eyes
there
was
nothing
but
inky
black

i
felt
a
dozen
contradictions
all
at
once

i
felt
like
i
needed
to
take
a
leak

now
i
didnt

now
i
did

i
went
to
the
bathroom
sat
down
relaxed
my
bladder
and
stared
through
the
wall
and
started
to
be
taken
away
being
pulled
fast
and
hard
and
strong
i
resisted
pulled
back

i
didnt
need
to
pee
after
all
it
seemed

i
stood
up
a
little
dizzy
started
back
to
my
pillows

my
brother
turned
the
corner
checking
up
on
me

hi
he
said
how
you
doing

he
seemed
almost
alien
i
almost
didnt
recognize
him
and
yet
he
was
the
most
familiar
thing
in
the
world
at
the
same
time

good
i
responded

holding
my
arms
tight
against
me
cold
again
nervous

impulsively
i
hugged
him
tight
almost
clinging

i
didnt
realized
how
scared
i
was
until
then

wow
i
said

i
made
it
back
to
my
pillows
laid
down

she
took
me
fast
much
stronger
much
harder
than
the
initial
wave

the
first
wave
was
nothing

i
lost
all
awareness
of
my
body
my
surroundings
everything
around
me

i
felt
myself
fall
right
through
the
earth
like
a
neutrino
like
the
earth
was
nothing
but
empty
space

i
left
my
body
completely
and
dissolved
into
the
universe

my
mind
became
placed
into
the
mind
of
the
universe
expanded
into
it
knowing
everything
to
be
known
but
completely
unable
to
think
in
thoughts
words
my
mind-voice
was
completely
gone
yet
i
was
completely
aware
of
ideas
knowledge
wisdom
abstractions
which
were
so
perfectly
clear
and
understandable
to
me
outside
of
any
known
constructs
of
language
way
beyond
language
completely
nonlinear
thought
and
yet
not-thought

just
knowing

pure
knowing

my
mind
my
consciousness
my
poor
little
brain
struggled
to
keep
up
with
it
struggled
to
keep
up
with
everything
streaming
in
struggled
to
fit
the
mind
of
the
universe
within
in

she
spoke
to
me
tried
to
calm
me
tried
to
explain

youre
dying
she
said

youre
dying

isnt
it
beautiful

and
i
was

i
felt
myself
my
mind
me
turn
inside
out
again
and
again
it
came
in
waves
slow
imploding
inward
waves
which
twisted
and
folded
me
inside
out
again
and
again
and
each
time
was
a
death
a
shocking
terrifying
incredibly
beautiful
intense
joyful
incredibly
profound
death

i
died
over
and
over
and
over
hundreds
of
times
that
night
all
while
she
tried
to
coax
me
show
me
teach
me
love
me

i
felt
like
arjuna
in
the
baghavad
gita
when
krishna
reveals
himself
in
his
full
glory
only
the
brilliance
was
all
in
thought
there
were
no
visuals
just
pure
inky
black
emptiness
void

something
in
me
wouldnt
break
though
something
in
me
held
back
even
still
after
all
those
deaths
it
wasnt
just
fear
it
was
love
i
wouldnt
give
her
my
heart
my
emotion
my
pain
my
core

she
gently
pulled
and
tugged
let
go
she
said
just
let
go

i
started
to
feel
my
connection
to
my
body
again
faintly
as
if
through
a
dark
shrouded
distant
unreal
dream
completely
alien
to
me
my
body
started
flexing
back
my
breathing
built
in
intensity
from
very
slow
and
very
deep
to
hard
intense
forceful
breaths
approaching
hyperventilation
seemingly
beyond
my
recognition
to
control
rather
than
my
ability

my
body
was
alien
the
physical
realm
was
alien

i
couldnt
cope
with
it

i
opened
my
eyes
i
sat
up
sharply
i
gasped

everything
seemed
alien
but
not
because
i
didnt
recognize
things
or
people
it
was
as
if
i
were
seeing
everything
for
what
it
_really_
was
rather
than
how
i
perceived
things
as
a
human
with
human
senses

everything
spoke
to
me
on
a
different
level

i
started
to
panic
the
physical
realm
was
alien
my
mind
was
alien
there
was
nothing
of
comfort
nothing
i
recognized
as
real
and
true
as
id
always
known
them

i
jumped
up
and
accidently
stepped
on
someones
foot

empathy
washed
over
me
in
waves
and
i
couldnt
stop
apologizing

the
owner
of
the
foot
took
one
look
at
me
and
gave
me
a
hug
asked
if
i
needed
anything

speech
words
ideas
i
grasped
for
that
part
of
my
mind
struggled
to
communicate
fell
into
her
eyes
her
soul
saw
her
very
inner
being
felt
her
love
and
compassion
wash
over
me

i
dont
know
i
whimpered

i
dont
know

i
dont
know

do
you
want
to
go
outside

i
dont
know

i
looked
at
the
door

outside

it
seemed
so
vast
so
open
the
jungle
out
the
back
porch

i
could
feel
the
cooler
air
streaming
in

yes
i
said

i
stumbled
outside
to
my
shock

the
plants
the
trees
they
were
so
alive

they
were
so
alien

i
could
feel
them
i
knew
them
they
were
alive
feeling
sentient
beings
completely
alien
to
anything
id
ever
experienced
even
shrooms

i
recognized
them
as
plants
i
recognized
their
shapes
but
everything
else
was
alien

their
personalities
spoke
to
me
comforted
me
in
eery
knowing
silence
identified
with
me
felt
sorry
for
me

my
brother
came
and
stood
next
to
me
trying
to
evaluate
my
state

you
ok

again
i
struggled
for
words
i
tried
to
evaluate
my
emotions
to
little
avail

i
dont
know
i
whimpered
i
dont
kow

do
you
feel
sick
he
asked

the
mere
suggestion
washed
waves
of
nauseousness
over
me

yes
i
said

do
you
want
to
throw
up

yes

i
thought
it
would
make
me
feel
better

purge
myself

start
the
cycle
down

i
tried
throwing
up

it
didnt
work

put
your
finger
down
your
throat
my
brother
softly
suggested

i
put
what
felt
like
my
whole
hand
down
my
throat
and
wretched
over
the
railing
into
the
forest

my
body
felt
better
at
first
and
then
whoosh

the
strongest
wave
yet
washed
over
me
pulled
me
in
captured
me

i
was
in
purgatory
stuck
between
the
physical
and
mental
realm
not
comfortable
in
either
afraid
of
both

please
i
whimpered

please
please
please
please

by
this
time
everyone
started
gathering
around
me

i
looked
into
each
one
of
them
supplicating
with
a
please

at
first
whimpering
and
then
stronger
and
stronger
more
and
more
forced

please

please

they
formed
a
tight
circle
around
me
hugging
me
in
turn
trying
to
figure
out
what
i
needed
how
to
help
me

please
what
dear

please
what

the
question
perplexed
me

i
didnt
know

just
please

please

the
waves
washed
over
me
my
body
went
limp
after
each
passing
one
and
after
each
one
i
would
stand
rigid
and
force
a
please

more
and
more
insistent

my
awareness
of
the
physical
realm
starts
to
fade
from
here
but
i
remember
yelling
please
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
and
then
supplicating
and
then
whimpering

how
can
i
live
knowing
what
i
know

how
can
i
live
feeling
what
ive
felt

how
can
i
live
seeing
what
ive
seen

how
can
i
live

how
can
i
live

i
dont
remember
saying
all
of
this
it
was
related
back
to
me
afterwards

i
felt
like
i
was
pulsing
throbbing
glowing
with
energy

my
gaze
stared
through
each
person
with
fierce
intensity
i
looked
through
each
person

only
a
few
held
my
intense
gaze
looking
through
them
literally
feeling
my
ability
to
pull
them
into
me
into
the
intensity
of
my
experience

some
started
pulling
away
as
i
pulled
them
into
me
i
could
feel
their
anxiety
as
they
realized
felt
what
i
was
going
through
where
i
was

do
you
want
to
lay
down
they
asked
me

they
motioned
to
my
pillows

i
look
at
my
pillows
uncertainly

it
seemed
comforting

i
started
to
relax
and
let
them
start
to
lay
me
down

another
imploding
wave
of
death
washed
over
me
as
i
let
myself
relax
and
sink
into
it

no
please
i
snapped
to
back
to
rigid
attention
exhausted
with
the
extreme
physical
and
mental
exertion
it
required
for
me
to
maintain
a
connection
to
the
physical
realm

i
started
clinging
to
some
of
them
wrapping
my
entire
body
arms
legs
around
them

especially
the
rose-water
leader

he
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
to
know
how
to
respond
strong
enough
mentally
to
contain
me

he
forced
me
to
stand
on
my
own
forced
my
arms
at
my
sides

i
threw
some
scornful
pleases
in
his
direction
but
he
didnt
flinch

my
body
would
go
completely
limp
in
waves
pulling
me
back
in
and
he
shouted
at
me
no

he
forced
me
to
remain
standing

he
became
stern
but
warm
full
of
love
and
compassion

the
others
backed
off
only
catching
me
if
i
started
to
fall

it
was
just
me
and
him
in
a
stand
off

please

please
i
directed
at
him

a
wave
would
wash
over
me
and
i
would
start
to
fall
then
jump
stamp
force
myself
to
attention
hold
my
chin
up
proudly
when
i
was
able
to
stave
them
off

please
i
directed
at
him
again
proudly

he
comforted
me

this
is
you
he
said
touching
my
chest

feel
the
power

this
is
you

i
would
start
to
go
limp

no

this
is
you

this
is
you

feel
your
power

feel
your
power

i
stamped
the
ground
again
with
my
feet
looked
up
i
was
mentally
exhausted
absolutely
exhausted
barely
clinging
on

ive
seen
you
before
he
said

i
know
i
thought
in
my
state

i
know
you
all

i
am
you
all

i
know
you
he
said

ive
seen
you
before

the
others
started
murmering
in
agreement
from
behind
me

you
look
christ-like
he
said

i
accepted
it
without
question
it
was
obvious
to
me
in
my
state

i
was
christ

i
was
god

the
energy
the
confidence
the
power
the
love
in
me
began
to
surge
i
felt
it
expand
around
me
encompassing
everyone

it
became
very
quiet
very
still
just
me
standing
there
breathing
pulsing
glowing

i
let
my
guard
down
i
relaxed
my
shoulders
my
body
slightly

i
was
regaining
control

i
was
becoming
me
again

i
breathed
the
biggest
deepest
most
comforting
breath
of
my
life

thank
you
i
said
to
my
leader

thank
you

i
turned
to
each
one

thank
you

no
thank
you
the
leader
said
to
me
as
i
noticed
each
of
them
also
start
to
come
down
relax
breathe

the
power
of
ayahuasca
was
definitely
with
you
tonight
my
friend
he
said
relieved
to
have
me
back

for
those
moments
they
had
become
me

they
were
me

i
had
them
trapped
in
my
attention
in
my
mind
every
one
of
them
a
vivid
picture
in
my
mind
and
i
could
feel
myself
letting
them
go
one
by
one

i
hugged
them
all

two
or
three
hours
had
passed


they
walked
me
outside
to
the
front
this
time
and
under
the
moon
under
the
stars
was
a
megalithic
rock
garden
the
igneous
rocks
seemingly
perfectly
arranged
in
perfect
harmony
to
each
other
pulsing
with
energy
alive
knowing
watching
greeting
me

i
walked
around
them
in
circles
slow
slow
circles

greeting
each
one
blessing
each
one
as
i
passed
by

everything
i
saw
i
blessed
internally
or
with
a
thank
you

i
blessed
the
moon
the
stars
the
planet
the
air
the
rocks
each
person
myself
my
surroundings
the
night

a
few
stayed
with
me
watched
me
quietly
followed
me
caught
in
my
spell

i
would
inscribe
circles
around
them
each
in
turn
as
i
circled
around
the
rock
garden

circles
circles
circles
first
one
way
then
the
other

i
felt
so
calm
so
peaceful
so
beautiful
so
alive

i
sucked
the
life-energy
of
the
air
into
me
i
could
feel
my
blood
capture
it
i
could
feel
it
course
through
my
body
i
could
feel
it
be
released
i
could
feel
the
energy
flowing
through
me
i
could
hear
the
energy
flowing
through
me

i
basked
in
my
own
internal
fire
remembering
all
my
college
science
religion
philosphy
lessons
knowing
them
realizing
them
feeling
it
all
happen
feeling
it
all
make
so
much
beautiful
sense
and
harmony

there
seemed
to
be
rising
commotion
coming
from
inside

eventually
slowly
i
made
my
way
back
in

one
of
the
other
participants
got
stuck
but
a
different
place
than
me

he
became
extremely
violent
yelling
and
whimpering
i
dont
understand

over
and
over

he
was
a
friend
who
had
just
helped
talk
me
down
just
minutes
earlier

he
was
lashing
out
at
things
people
clinging
digging
into
their
flesh

i
tried
to
talk
him
down
to
let
him
recognize
me
i
let
my
mind
enter
that
space
his
space
ever
so
carefully

it
worked
for
a
little
while
until
he
clung
to
me
with
such
tenacity
he
began
to
hurt
me
dig
into
my
flesh
pull
out
clumps
of
my
long
hair

they
helped
pull
him
from
me

he
broke
one
persons
glasses
and
bit
anothers
thumb
fairly
severely
to
the
bone

we
werent
able
to
control
him
he
was
lost

we
brought
him
back
home
to
his
room
1/2k
away
to
let
him
come
down
in
peace
and
comfort

he
remembers
nothing
of
the
violence
his
down
personality
being
completely
unviolent
and
unantagonistic

the
transformation
was
amazing

the
other
leader
who
had
a
gift
for
reading
into
people
told
me
afterwards
that
he
saw
my
heart
swollen
huge
like
it
was
ready
to
burst

he
asked
me
to
think
about
anything
in
my
life
that
i
needed
to
let
go
of
or
deal
with

i
was
actually
in
the
extremely
intense
painful
and
drawn-out
process
of
breaking
up
with
my
girlfriend
of
several
years

for
the
other
guy
he
said
he
saw
a
large
insect-like
being
clinging
to
his
head
holding
on
talking
to
him

the
leader
talked
with
the
insect
to
find
out
what
he
wanted

the
insect
said
he
was
telling
him
what
he
needed
to
know

the
leader
told
the
insect
to
leave
because
we
couldnt
control
him

the
insect
left
and
our
friend
became
even
more
frenzied
so
he
called
the
insect
back
to
calm
him
down
which
eventually
happened

the
evening
broke
up
with
a
rather
weird
energy
after
that


a
lingering
indescribable
chemical-like
taste
or
smell
stuck
with
me
for
several
hours
afterwards
as
well
as
a
kind
of
glowing
tao-like
pattern
before
my
eyes
very
indistinct

i
made
it
back
to
me
room
where
i
slept
well
that
night

all
in
all
i
consider
the
experience
a
positive
and
necessary
one
which
taught
me
what
to
expect
from
this
class
of
substances
and
how
to
better
prepare
for
any
future
consumption
including
dosage

i
am
still
processing
this
experience
many
months
later
as
little
by
little
my
mind
lets
me
remember
more
of
it
curiously
the
distinct
chemical
flavor
returns
with
the
memories

immediately
afterwards
and
for
several
weeks
my
mind
wouldnt
let
me
think
about
it
a
strange
and
unique
phenomenon
for
me

it
was
a
full-blown
psychological
near-death
experience
and
thats
how
my
mind
remembers
it--with
trepidation

i
am
curious
to
repeat
the
experience
in
due
time
knowing
what
i
know
now

it
was
the
definitely
the
most
profound
experience
of
my
life

the
next
evening
i
got
back
on
the
horse
and
smoked
some
crystalline
nn-dmt
for
the
first
time

id
heard
5-meo
dmt
referred
to
as
the
power
and
nn-dmt
as
the
glory

that
is
exactly
how
my
experiences
fit
with
these
two

my
intent
with
this
experience
was
to
understand
my
experience
of
the
night
before

there
was
a
group
of
6
of
us
plus
the
supplier
with
the
pipe

we
were
in
one
of
our
rooms
on
the
beds

i
was
the
second
to
last
to
try
it
all
of
the
others
had
experiences
lasting
10-15
minutes
max

i
inhaled
three
or
four
strong
puffs
laid
back
and
fell
through
the
bed

it
came
on
very
fast
very
strong
and
extremely
visual
the
most
visual
of
anything
ive
done
eyes
open
or
shut
and
completely
unlike
5-meo
which
was
barely
visual
and
strangely
only
with
open
eyes

it
was
out
of
body
my
body
felt
disconnected
as
the
night
before
somewhat
tingly
this
time
like
when
a
limb
falls
asleep

direction
orientation
gravity
etc
became
meaningless
in
this
completely
abstract
work
of
visual
art

i
found
myself
lying
down
in
a
room
surrounded
by
alien
presences
standing
all
around
me
in
my
peripheral
vision

the
presences
appeared
to
me
as
alternating
black
and
white
outlines
and
i
could
only
see
their
heads
peering
down
at
me

they
were
featureless
except
for
color
and
shape
a
black
head
shape
next
to
a
white
head
shape
next
to
a
black
head
shape
6-10
of
them
very
interested
in
me
but
trying
to
stay
out
of
my
field
of
vision

in
retrospect
i
felt
like
i
was
lying
on
hospital
bed
as
a
patient
of
these
presences

straight
in
front
of
me
or
above
me
in
the
distance
was
a
rectangular
box
slowly
approaching

it
was
my
reaction
to
the
box
the
presences
were
most
interested
in

as
i
studied
the
box
i
started
to
make
out
details

i
was
looking
into
the
open
side
of
the
box
and
along
the
top
edge
were
about
a
dozen
or
more
dancing
snakes
weaving
rythmically
back
and
forth
like
sea
grass
rippling
under
the
sea
and
pulsing
in
rainbow
psychedelic
colors
mostly
reds

it
was
absolutely
hypnotic
to
watch
as
they
slowly
approached
with
the
open
box
below
them

slowly
my
attention
moved
from
the
snakes
to
the
contents
of
the
box

on
the
left
was
a
circular
disk
quartered
with
a
black
dot
in
each
quarter
also
pulsing
and
with
rainbow
colors

on
the
right
was
a
round
flask
with
a
long
neck
and
i
quickly
realized
this
was
the
most
important
of
the
objects
being
revealed
to
me

as
i
drew
my
attention
to
it
it
slowly
came
towards
me
open
end
into
my
mouth

i
could
feel
the
flask
on
my
lips
in
the
physical
realm
which
surprised
me
and
suddenly
and
involuntarily
i
began
to
swallow
again
and
again
drinking
what
felt
like
pure
energy

as
i
began
drinking
from
the
flask
my
field
of
vision
was
drawn
into
the
contents
of
the
flask

i
zoomed
in
closer
and
closer
until
i
realized
with
a
start
that
i
was
drinking
dna
i
could
make
out
the
strands
and
then
the
double
helixes
and
then
as
a
single
strand
loomed
to
fill
my
vision
it
began
to
unwind
and
i
followed
the
strand
_simultaneously_
in
both
directions
at
once
forward
and
backward
in
time
a
strange
but
pleasant
sensation

what
followed
was
an
incredible
experience
i
felt
myself
morphing
into
various
species
all
feeling
very
familiar

it
was
not
so
much
visual
as
it
was
what
it
actually
felt
like
to
be
in
the
mind
and
body
of
first
a
fish
then
a
frog
then
a
snake
an
eagle
a
lioni
was
experiencing
the
unfolding
of
life
itself
and
realizing
as
i
had
realized
the
night
before
and
on
other
trips
and
meditations
that
the
story
of
life
is
not
one
of
simple
chance
and
contingency
influenced
so
much
by
natural
selection
as
we
observe
in
the
greater
physical
realm
but
rather
it
is
directed
by
a
simple
life
force
of
pure
energy
which
operates
on
the
smallest
of
conscious
sentient
levels
down
to
the
very
molecules
atoms
even
quarks
and
smaller
where
matter
and
energy
blend
and
are
really
one
and
the
same

all
of
it
is
conscious
the
entire
universe
is
conscious
and
connected
at
every
level
and
every
size
and
we
are
nothing
more
than
manifestations
physical
packages
containers
of
that
pre-existing
everlasting
all-pervading
consciousness

dna
strands
are
nothing
more
than
books
physical
mnuemonics
stable
energy
forms
of
ideas
and
patterns
that
worked
and
are
written
saved
and
read
back
by
this
all-pervading
life-force

working
patterns
of
dna
are
not
simply
selected
by
pure
chance
as
classic
evolutionary
theory
would
have
us
believe
it
is
being
written
and
directed
by
something
much
greater
much
more
pervasive
and
much
more
subtle
than
weve
ever
till
now
supposed
and
this
all-pervasive
awareness
is
finally
being
realized
in
the
west
through
quantum
mechanics
evolutionary
theory
mythology
psychology
synchronicity
and
most
especially
psychonautics

but
i
digress

slowly
my
field
of
view
returned
back
from
the
contents
of
the
flask
back
out
to
the
snakes
approaching
ever
closer
until
i
realized
they
werent
just
snakes
but
sharp
scythes
lashing
out
at
me
cutting
at
my
chest
my
heart
dancing
ever
so
rythmically
gently
but
necessarily
telling
me
to
let
go
open
my
heart
let
go
let
myself
feel

i
opened
my
eyes

the
room
was
nothing
but
paisley
patterns
and
paisley
people

my
body
was
somewhat
tense

i
closed
my
eyes
again

the
snakes
were
gone
i
couldnt
see
the
presences
but
i
knew
they
were
still
there
watching
me
protecting
me

in
the
distance
a
different
presence
began
to
approach
a
large
red
demon-like
creature
with
a
knobby
bulbuous
head
and
bulging
arms
and
fierce
but
nonhostile
eyes

his
right
arm
and
hand
was
outstreched
reaching
for
my
head

he
gently
reached
through
my
flesh
my
skull
and
gently
palmed
my
mind
like
a
blanket
wrapped
around
my
brain

then
he
faded
into
dozens
of
eyes
peering
turning
twisting
watching
which
in
part
slowly
faded
into
darkness

i
opened
my
eyes
and
met
the
gaze
of
everyone
elses
eyes
in
the
room

the
feeling
of
the
demons
palm
and
the
presence
of
the
protective
entities
didnt
fade--they
were
meant
to
stay
with
me
and
they
have
even
now

30-40
minutes
had
passed
the
longest
that
evening
by
far

i
told
my
story
quietly
and
slowly
got
up

i
felt
much
relieved
from
my
previous
nights
experience
the
glory
of
dmt
was
ever
so
gentle
tender
compared
to
the
power
of
5-meo
dmt

after
the
experience
incidently
i
ended
up
having
to
piss
again
and
again
that
night
although
i
had
not
drank
more
liquids
than
usual
other
than
the
contents
of
the
flask
in
the
vision

weird

several
weeks
later
still
processing
these
two
dmt
experiences
i
had
one
of
the
most
realistic
vivid
dreams
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life

christian
ratsch
once
described
these
types
of
dreams
as
kali
dreams
after
the
hindu
goddess
of
mayhem
and
destruction

in
my
dream
i
was
a
child
again
back
in
middle
school
talking
to
a
beautiful
young
girl
who
in
retropect
looked
like
parvati
who
is
the
loving
gentle
alter-ego
of
kali

her
gaze
and
awareness
were
piercing
focused
all-seeing
all-knowing
and
her
eyes
looked
straight
into
me
and
gave
me
a
queasy
nervous
glowy
feeling
like
intense
love
at
first
sight

the
class
bell
rang
and
she
started
for
the
classroom
along
with
all
my
classmates
who
were
taking
their
seats

i
had
to
go
the
bathroom
though
and
i
knew
the
teacher
wouldnt
mind
me
being
a
little
late
it
was
my
favorite
spanish
teacher
incidently

returning
from
the
bathroom
i
walked
into
an
empty
classroom

the
back
door
was
open
though
and
sun
and
breeze
were
streaming
in

it
was
eerily
quiet

i
stepped
out
the
back
door
to
find
the
bodies
of
my
classmates
strewn
all
over
the
lawn
bloody
dead

only
a
couple
were
still
alive
catatonic
carefully
loading
the
bodies
into
a
sport-utility

i
stood
there
in
shock
watching
the
scene
trying
to
figure
out
what
had
happened
when
i
realized
i
was
being
watched

it
was
her
the
beautiful
girl
parvati/kali

she
looked
at
me
with
the
slightest
of
smiles
wide
eyes
arms
and
palms
turned
out
towards
me
presenting
the
entire
scene
to
me

with
that
gaze
i
instantly
realized
she
had
done
this
she
did
it
as
a
lesson
for
me
she
was
trying
to
show
me
how
beautiful
death
can
be
she
killed
these
children
to
teach
me
and
to
teach
them
the
beauty
and
value
of
both
life
and
death

she
freed
them
she
let
them
go
she
returned
them
to
the
eternal
all-pervasive
universal
consciousness

it
was
a
gift
her
gift
her
eternal
timeless
lesson
to
us
to
not
hold
on
so
tightly
to
such
a
precious
gift
as
life
and
overlook
the
precious
gift
that
is
death

with
this
realization
and
her
gentle
loving
gaze
i
was
overcome
with
an
overwhelming
sense
of
peace
beauty
joy
despite
my
natural
instincts
of
terror
and
revolt

the
scene
and
the
lesson
before
me
was
absolutely
sacred
and
necessary

kali
had
visited
me

i
opened
my
eyes
and
found
myself
wide
awake
in
bed
remembering
clearly
every
vivid
detail

---

the
following
account
was
provided
by
another
of
the
participants
in
the
room
with
me
on
the
first
night
and
offers
an
alternative
and
more
sane
perspective
on
the
events
that
occured
that
evening

my
thanks
to
the
participant
for
providing
me
with
this
wherever
you
are


pharmahuasca
night

i
was
one
of
the
9
people
in
the
group
that
night
and
i
took
only
a
20
mg
dose
here
is
my
own
version
of
the
story


and
so
that
brings
us
to
one
of
the
two
major
tales
of
la
semana
de
los
entheogenicos
that
being
la
noche
de
la
pharmahuasca
i
had
met
a
young
couple
earlier
in
the
week
j
a
hispanic
engineer
from
mit
and
r
his
korean
girlfriend
they
had
been
rambling
on
during
dinner
2
about
the
drug
that
they
prized
above
all
others
just
going
on
and
on
and
on
about
the
incredible
effects
of
this
stuff
which
was
incredibly
hard
to
find
called
twoseebee
so
i
listened
politely
for
about
10
minutes
of
this
then
took
the
canister
out
of
my
pocket
and
said
in
a
very
low
very
calm
voice
how
would
you
like
to
try
some
of
your
favorite
drug
well
the
details
of
the
rest
of
that
night
are
somewhat
hazy
but
somehow
we
became
very
good
friends
in
a
big
hurry
and
they
pretty
much
adopted
me
for
the
rest
of
the
conference
and
on
the
next
to
last
night
they
dragged
me
off
to
a
pharmahuasca
session
just
when
i
had
resolved
to
go
drug-free
that
night
to
prepare
my
poor
overworked
serotonin
receptors
for
the
last-night
blowout

first
some
background
pharmahuasca
as
you
of
course
know
is
any
combination
of
an
extracted
mao
inhibitor
usually
harmaline
derived
from
syrian
rue
peganum
harmala
along
with
a
tryptamine
such
as
dmt
or
psilocybin
as
it
turns
out
j
ott
is
preparing
to
market
in
europe
the
following
components
in
separate
packages
1
pills
containing
75
mg
of
harmaline
labeled
as
herbal
energizer
and
2
pills
containing
10
mg
of
5-meo-
dmt
and
labeled
as
an
herbal
tonic
the
point
being
that
they
will
be
sold
separately
so
that
only
those
in
the
know
so
to
speak
will
be
aware
that
they
must
take
2
of
pill
1
and
then
4
of
pill
2
in
order
to
achieve
orbital
velocity
what
a
brilliant
devious
twisted
mind
that
the
ott-man
possesses


so
it
was
that
i
found
myself
in
bungalow
3
with
eight
other
souls
that
night
at
ten
oclock
the
session
was
to
be
run
by
two
would-be
curanderos
steve
and
stevie
the
first
a
social
worker/social
activist
the
latter
a
sometime
rock
musician/sometime
acid
casualty
their
credentials
were
genuine
experience
of
several
amazonian
ayahuasca
sessions
and
a
collection
of
shamanic
power
objects
and
doodads
that
were
supposed
to
ward
off
evil
karma
the
other
participants
the
aforementioned
j
and
r
plus
t
a
british
pagan
earth
mother
who
hugged
everyone
and
everything
at
the
slightest
provocation
m
a
skinny
long
haired
sensitive
new
age
guy
d
who
looked
and
acted
like
a
hippie
pirate
and
b
a
swiss
burgher
type
who
turned
out
to
be
the
rock
solid
anchor
that
held
the
night
together
when
everyone
else
fell
apart


the
ground
was
prepared
for
the
sowing
the
beds
were
taken
apart
and
the
mattresses
placed
on
the
floor
along
with
rugs
and
sheets
to
cushion
all
against
the
hard
and
hurtful
places
lights
were
turned
out
and
candles
and
incense
lit
steve
and
steve
brought
out
a
sack
of
wondrous
things
crystals
metal
turnings
sculptures
dried
herbs
mandalas
and
an
exquisite
tiny
monkey
skull
that
caught
my
fancy
later
the
sacrament
was
passed
out
and
the
chanting
and
the
icaros
began

then
it
was
that
my
scientist
persona
emerged
there
was
a
side
debate
over
whether
the
harmala
pills
should
be
taken
some
minutes
before
the
trypt
or
simultaneously
instructions
were
that
all
should
be
taken
together
but
i
the
great
western
scientist
knew
that
the
harmaline
had
to
go
in
first
and
knock
off
the
enzyme
so
that
none
of
the
5meo
would
be
chewed
up
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
bad
idea
to
mix
western
medicine
and
primitive
shamanism
so
some
ended
up
dropping
all
at
once
and
others
a
half
hour
later
this
broke
up
the
feeling
of
unity
among
the
participants
and
also
resulted
in
some
getting
a
larger
effective
dose
as
it
turned
out
these
were
also
the
people
with
the
lower
body
weights
resulting
in
an
range
of
doses
from
cowardly
i
took
20
mg
up
to
foolhardy
40
mg
in
the
case
of
m
who
looked
to
weigh
about
100
pounds


so
anyway
the
deed
was
done
and
we
all
were
dosed
and
steve
and
steve
and
j
had
some
real
pretty
songs
and
chants
going
when
the
base
of
my
spine
started
to
vibrate
5meo
doesnt
favor
you
with
fancy
color
patterns
or
carrier
waves
or
elves
dancing
on
your
chakras
it
is
pure
power
intruding
on
your
core
it
is
a
push
a
shove
an
acceleration
a
rocket
exhaust
a
steadily
rising
voltage
like
being
at
the
base
of
the
grand
coulee
dam
as
an
earthquake
shatters
the
concrete
wall
and
lets
50000000
gallons
of
water
follow
the
force
of
gravity
towards
your
body
and
sweep
you
off
into
the
great
beyond
and
you
dont
have
any
idea
where
it
will
tail
off
and
allow
you
to
breathe
again
higher
and
higher
and
higher
and
yet
again
higher
and
just
as
it
starts
to
get
unbearable
the
peak
is
reached
and
i
settle
down
into
the
roller
coaster
and
realize
i
will
live
and
i
also
realize
that
some
of
those
around
me
have
taken
more
than
twice
my
dosage
and
are
still
rising
up
into
realms
inconceivable
at
this
point
all
in
the
room
are
silent
recumbent
on
their
mattresses
and
blankets
and
pillows
splayed
out
desperate
to
hang
on
to
shards
of
reality
and
then
the
groans
and
the
moans
begin
those
who
took
the
higher
dose
are
now
trying
to
deal
with
extreme
nausea
and
cramps
steve
the
primo
curandero
is
hit
the
hardest
and
begins
to
retch
and
puke
into
a
plastic
bag
transparent
so
all
can
see
the
full
drama
of
la
purga
cleansing
his
soul
two
others
lurch
onto
the
back
deck
to
heave
over
the
log
railing
into
the
back
yard
and
then
stagger
back
others
such
as
j
and
r
just
twist
and
writhe
in
agony
but
keep
their
stomach
contents
down
as
if
such
were
a
badge
of
honor
in
the
midst
of
the
battlefield
and
on
my
right
m
the
skeleton
man
begins
to
contract
his
limbs
like
a
pretzel
and
hyperventilate
and
emit
tiny
cries
of
horror
which
slowly
accellerate
and
become
more
and
more
complex
as
he
starts
to
coil
like
a
steel
spring
and
mutter
and
ullulate
and
then
zing
he
is
up
and
headed
for
the
back
deck
screaming
please
please
please

well
at
this
point
only
two
of
us
were
ambulatory
and
able
to
follow
in
pursuit
both
having
done
20
mg
doses
yours
truly
and
b
each
got
on
either
side
of
the
fellow
and
held
him
up
against
the
railing
until
curandero
steve
came
along
to
guide
the
flight
by
now
m
was
into
a
major
death
trip
and
his
screams
had
resolved
into
a
loud
pleeezzze
let
me
live
repeated
slowly
over
and
over
steve
had
to
talk
him
back
into
his
body
using
alternating
love
and
logic
in
the
best
intrepid
traveler
fashion
and
slowly
everyone
else
drifted
out
on
the
deck
in
various
conditions
and
levels
of
unreality
we
made
a
ragged
circle
of
seriously
twisted
souls
group
hugging
and
singing
and
soothing
the
lost
one
back
into
a
semblance
of
humanity
one
by
one
people
would
break
away
from
the
circle
and
go
heave
whatever
fluids
were
left
inside
over
the
rail
until
it
resembled
the
gutter
outside
a
roman
orgy
after
about
an
hour
of
this
m
had
returned
to
a
merely
transcendental
state
and
we
all
went
inside
happy
in
order
to
compare
notes
people
were
making
up
icaros
and
drumming
on
whatever
was
handy
and
the
good
feelings
returned
for
quite
awhile
i
got
into
examining
the
power
objects
now
strewn
around
the
room
along
with
melted
candle
wax
half-full
barf
bags
blankets
pillows
shoes
flotsam
and
jetsam
strewn
around
as
if
the
berserkers
had
marched
through
j
remarked
to
me
that
the
experience
wasnt
as
strong
as
he
hoped
for
and
he
was
a
bit
disappointed
despite
having
taken
40
mg
n
said
that
he
was
almost
straight

and
then
there
seemed
to
come
a
second
wave
of
drug
action
everyone
who
had
previously
had
severe
nausea
doubled
over
again
and
started
groaning
my
own
stomach
started
to
complain
at
this
point
and
i
almost
lost
it
as
the
room
started
to
breath
in
and
out
there
was
a
general
migration
back
to
the
deck
where
j
and
r
got
into
a
hammock
strung
up
between
two
poles
desperately
trying
to
get
comfortable
i
missed
what
happened
next
as
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
my
head
and
stomach
but
it
soon
became
apparent
that
we
had
another
freakout


it
seems
that
j
somehow
slowly
regressed
into
an
animal
state
becoming
hostile
and
assaultive
towards
any
and
all
that
were
out
on
the
deck
with
him
girlfriend
r
apparently
having
seen
this
trip
before
fled
to
the
safety
of
the
bungalow
bathroom
meanwhile
b
and
n
were
sort
of
restraining
j
who
was
screaming
out
curses
and
general
abuse
to
any
who
came
near
while
kicking
and
clawing
anyone
within
reach
and
the
look
on
his
face
was
one
of
absolute
savage
hatred
with
four
large
men
pretty
much
restraining
him
i
left
the
scene
to
check
on
m
who
was
starting
to
fray
at
the
edges
again
and
r
who
was
in
the
bathroom
sobbing
away
just
then
it
all
broke
loose
on
the
deck
in
back
and
i
heard
several
people
shout
in
succession
followed
by
a
crash
as
a
body
smashed
heavily
into
the
rear
window
somehow
the
window
did
not
break
but
the
shouts
resumed
and
m
totally
totally
freaked
ran
past
me
out
the
front
door
and
off
into
the
general
population
as
it
were
i
followed
him
and
soon
gently
led
him
back
into
the
madhouse
when
the
loud
noises
stopped
well
what
had
transpired
was
that
j
had
bitten
b
severely
on
the
hand
drawing
a
fair
amount
of
blood
and
in
the
confusion
had
broken
away
and
run
off
at
full
speed
into
the
window
he
probably
couldnt
even
see
at
that
point
well
he
was
shortly
subdued
and
placed
on
his
back
with
four
people
gently
restraining
him
from
gouging
their
eyes
out
bad
karma
circulating
in
that
brain
of
his
he
soon
attained
a
childlike
state
in
which
he
replied
to
anything
that
was
said
with
i
dont
want
to
in
a
petulant
tone
brave
psychonaut
reduced
to
a
three-year
old
the
rest
of
the
session
was
taken
up
with
surrounding
this
infantile
creature
with
kindness
and
trying
to
establish
human
contact
while
the
whole
time
he
used
any
free
limbs
to
try
and
inflict
damage
on
anyone
and
anything
within
reach
brave
b
even
tho
wounded
turned
out
to
have
the
great
deal
of
strength
needed
to
keep
this
animal
contained
while
all
around
people
continued
to
take
breaks
to
dry
heave
or
administer
each
other
hugs
and
support
for
their
own
still
fractured
and
tormented
psyches


well
it
was
a
wonder
that
during
all
this
no
other
people
came
to
investigate
what
in
the
name
of
moloch
was
going
on
granted
that
the
bungalow
was
on
the
edge
of
the
compound
several
people
told
me
the
next
day
that
they
heard
the
screams
but
i
guess
it
wasnt
that
rare
over
the
course
of
the
week
and
who
wants
to
step
into
that
degree
of
weirdness
so
at
that
time
now
330
in
the
morning
everyone
was
whipped
and
at
least
starting
to
come
down
and
the
steves
were
obviously
beginning
to
regret
the
whole
endeavor
so
the
closing
ceremonies
were
kind
of
forgotten
and
the
game
became
how
do
we
get
rid
of
this
guy
j
j
and
r
lived
up
on
the
hill
in
my
sector
so
the
whole
party
ventured
out
of
the
bungalow
en
masse
escorting
the
crazy
guy
with
me
lighting
the
way
with
my
trusty
flashlight
and
one
by
one
without
any
farewell
people
silently
started
to
peel
off
and
slink
away
to
the
shelter
of
their
own
cozy
safe
havens
until
it
was
only
girlfriend
r
and
myself
carrying
the
supplies
while
poor
b
pretty
much
wrestled
mad
j
up
the
hill
under
the
glare
of
the
full
moon
he
was
actually
starting
to
recover
his
senses
at
that
point
and
went
more
or
less
under
his
own
power
while
still
emitting
an
unbroken
string
of
curses
so
we
reached
the
dwelling
place
of
j
and
r
finally
and
the
unhappy
couple
was
deposited
in
their
bed
with
b
playing
chaperone
for
however
long
it
took
to
be
confident
that
j
was
not
capable
of
murder
i
took
myself
off
to
my
own
bed
at
that
point
and
slept
right
through
breakfast
the
next
morning
but
emerged
in
time
to
hear
sashas
chemistry
tour
de
force
and
later
had
a
pleasant
conversation
over
lunch
with
a
very
flustered
and
repentant
j
who
was
blessed
with
a
greatly
enhanced
respect
for
psychoactives
and
a
whole
lot
of
stuff
to
work
through
over
the
course
of
the
next
few
months




700am

woke
up
very
energized
ready
for
the
day
headed
off
to
the
beach
for
a
morning
dip
a
cleanse
after
the
emotional
wake
of
the
new
moon
the
night
before


1200pm
arrived
at
home
gathered
the
medicine
the
plan
was
to
drink
a
syrian
rue
decoction
35g
followed
by
150mg
of
yellow
dmt
crystals
with
a
friend
well
call
her
momo


200pm

arrived
at
momos
house
placed
9g
of
ground
syrian
rue
in
a
small
sauce
pan
added
the
juice
of
one
lime
and
2oz
of
water
brought
it
to
a
light
rolling
boil
and
allowed
it
to
simmer
for
10min
added
1oz
of
water
and
allowed
it
to
simmer
10
more
minutes
strained
off
the
muck
and
allowed
the
tea
to
cool


230pm
divided
the
rue
decoction
into
two
portions
and
drank
up
not
the
most
pleasant
of
tastes
sharp
aftertaste
but
it
didnt
linger
for
too
long
i
had
only
eaten
a
few
blueberries
and
2
cups
of
carrot/mixed
greens
juice
around
1100am
momo
had
a
fruit
smoothie
an
hour
before
the
rue
was
ingested

we
decided
for
one
reason
or
another
to
smoke
the
dmt
instead
of
ingesting
and
went
off
on
a
walk
to
allow
the
rue
to
take
effect
we
were
not
anticipating
any
psychoactive
effects
from
the
rue
since
most
sources
said
more
than
35g
is
needed
for
strong
psychoactive
effects

boy
were
we
surprised

300pm
walking
along
a
railroad
track
we
both
began
to
notice
shifts
in
visual
perception
the
clouds
would
be
sucked
into
which
ever
point
of
the
sky
wed
focus
on
very
light
body
feel
very
similar
to
a
low
dose
of
mushrooms
but
more
aching
to
lsa
we
were
talking
about
visual
conditioning
the
concept
that
fractal
visuals
and
such
experienced
on
psychoactives
are
the
true
faces
of
the
natural
world
a
world
that
exist
only
in
motion
we
are
raised
as
kids
learning
from
books
and
pictures
so
we
begin
believe
and
are
trained
to
see
the
world
as
still
and
unalive


330pm

arrived
back
at
the
house
at
this
point
we
were
really
feeling
the
syrian
rue
the
body
feel
was
very
drunk-like
slightly
impaired
motor
function

we
pulled
up
a
guided
meditation
by
deepak
chopra
and
sat
down
to
take
a
look
within
surreal
body
awareness
is
an
understatement
during
the
meditation
i
had
to
open
my
eyes
and
check
my
body
because
it
felt
like
i
was
twitching
all
over
perfectly
still
i
felt
an
intense
and
quick
pulse
in
my
right
arm
and
had
to
check
the
pulse
on
my
neck
to
make
sure
slow
and
steady
momo
noticed
me
checking
and
confirmed
the
same
feel
of
twitching
and
pulsing
by
this
time
we
were
aware
that
we
were
just
feeling
all
the
minor
functions
and
movement
in
our
body
that
we
dont
notice
on
the
regular
the
meditation
went
deeper
as
the
close-eyed
visuals
enhance
black
backdrop
with
small
golden
lights
coming
together
to
form
small
lotuses
along
the
silhouette
of
where
momo
was
before
i
closed
my
eyes
as
i
would
focus
on
the
breath
the
walls
and
all
of
this
physical
reality
felt
like
it
was
right
up
against
my
eye
lids
my
physical
body
was
never
more
apparent
and
i
could
feel
the
fluids
and
breath
circulating
through
all
the
channels

my
physical
body
was
never
more
apparent
and
i
could
feel
the
fluids
and
breath
circulating
through
all
the
channels



after
the
meditation
i
walked
to
the
car
to
get
my
didgeridoo
which
proved
quite
challenging
from
the
drunken
body
feel
this
sensation
only
occurred
while
moving
and
would
take
a
few
seconds
to
go
away
when
stillness
was
attained
pushing
and
pulling
became
very
strange
sensations
when
i
pulled
the
handle
of
the
car
it
felt
like
the
whole
world
was
coming
towards
me
along
with
the
door
when
i
pushed
the
door
of
the
house
open
it
felt
like
the
whole
world
was
rushing
towards
me
from
behind


i
sat
on
the
floor
using
the
couch
as
a
backrest
and
began
playing
the
didgeridoo
momo
sat
on
the
couch
behind
me
with
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
began
channeling
her
breath
through
her
and
into
me
playing
took
a
few
seconds
to
get
acclimated
to
but
then
became
so
natural
and
fluid
the
body
awareness
proved
to
be
very
useful
to
control
the
smaller
details
of
sound
after
a
few
minutes
i
stopped
playing
because
i
noticed
a
strange
sensation
flowing
down
my
hands
i
sat
and
observed
realizing
that
whenever
momo
would
exhale
i
would
feel
a
rush
of
sensations
flowing
into
my
shoulders
and
down
my
arms
out
my
fingers
as
she
would
inhale
a
calm
would
ensure
-
very
similar
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
shore
line
the
water
rushing
in
and
slowly
receding
we
both
began
laughing
at
the
realization
and
the
implications
of
what
we
were
feeling
we
stepped
outside
as
the
body
feel
began
to
weigh
down
on
us
at
this
point
nausea
kicked
in

430pm
the
nausea
began
to
take
me
to
an
uncomfortable
headspace
momo
felt
a
slight
strangeness
but
no
nausea
till
an
hour
later
i
lay
back
on
the
grass
which
helped
a
little
watching
little
spinning/twinkling
dots
spread
out
grid-like
in
the
sky


500pm
we
came
back
to
the
house
and
straight
to
the
couch
any
movement
would
be
registered
significantly
more
intense
than
it
really
was
which
began
to
feel
very
uncomfortable
paired
with
the
nausea
after
a
few
minutes
of
lying
down
we
decided
to
nap
and
also
decided
not
to
take
any
dmt
this
time
around
the
rue
was
more
than
enough
for
the
moment
and
there
was
some
discomfort
the
nap
was
interesting
the
body
would
rest
but
the
mind
was
very
active
we
put
on
some
spanish
medicine
songs
and
vibed
out
listening
to
music
was
so
profound
every
note
was
felt
echoing
within
the
body
very
similar
to
the
first
time
listening
to
music
on
lsd


600pm
we
got
on
up
momo
was
going
to
shower
i
began
to
play
a
flute
and
noticed
myself
a
little
more
revitalized
much
less
of
the
drunken
feel
but
definitely
still
feeling
psychedelic
visuals
began
to
be
more
consistent
trails
as
i
would
turn
my
head
-
as
compared
to
abrupt
and
random
visuals
from
prior
while
she
was
in
the
shower
i
decided
i
felt
up
to
for
the
dmt
so
went
ahead
and
prepared
the
pipe
i
use
a
small
bubbler
without
water
there
is
a
screen
with
some
mostly
burnt
black/ashy
dried
passion
vine
i
placed
50mg
of
crystals
in
the
plant
material
and
placed
another
screen
on-top
there
ends
up
being
about
1mm
of
space
between
the
top
screen
and
the
plant
material/crystals
ive
found
this
setup
to
be
very
effective
to
vaporize
the
dmt
especially
after
the
pipe
had
some
resin
accumulated


630pm
blast
off
nothing
could
have
prepared
me
for
what
was
about
to
happen

before
venturing
into
this
i
feel
the
need
to
share
my
experience
with
psychedelics
and
the
void
i
have
been
exploring
with
plant
medicine
for
a
few
years
ive
taken
mushrooms
psilocybe
cubensis
countless
times
from
micro-dosing
to
5g
of
penis
envy
ive
experienced
high
doses
of
fresh
truffles
p
tampanensis
and
blasted
off
with
psilocybe
azurescens
peak
waves
were
on
par
with
dmt
breakthroughs
smoked
dmt
over
a
dozen
times
with
three
being
full-blown
breakthroughs
also
have
sat
in
one
ayahuasca
ceremony
and
two
peyote
ceremonies
and
taken
peyote
out
of
ceremony
several
times
i
have
messed
with
lsd
over
two
dozen
times
but
never
exceeded
two
stamps
i
meditate
daily
and
have
been
practicing
kundalini
yoga
for
two
years
i
am
very
fond
of
astral
exploration
a
true
psychonaut
at
heart
strongly
rooted
with
plant
medicine
and
experiencing
the
great
mystery
to
its
full
extent
i
have
always
taken
pride
in
being
able
to
find
peace
in
these
altered
states
of
consciousness
and
consider
it
as
part
of
my
journey
to
explore
these
realms
and
share
the
fruits
with
my
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
form
of
music
herbal
wisdom
body
work
and
the
origin
of
it
all
love

i
mention
all
of
this
to
stress
the
intensity
of
this
experience
it
made
any
amount
of
mushrooms
or
dmt
seem
like
a
walk
in
the
park
it
is
to
date
the
most
intense
and
paradigm/life-shattering
experience
i
have
ever
lived
through
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
does
not
have
a
profound
background
with
psychedelics
and
even
then
i
caution
to
proceed
with
much
mental
preparation


so
momo
lit
the
bowl
for
me
i
saw
the
crystals
beneath
the
screen
melt
tasted
the
vapor
travel
down
my
throat
one
pretty
large
toke
i
should
have
stopped
here
half
way
through
the
second
toke
i
began
to
feel
the
dmt
onset
the
vibration
the
humming
the
oscillating
visuals
went
in
for
a
third
toke
already
feeling
this
reality
tearing
away
i
closed
my
eyes
and
saw
striped
women
revealing
a
gate
but
it
was
pulsing
opening
and
closing
opening
and
closing
up
to
here
it
was
very
familiar
the
visuals
were
familiar
the
feeling
and
sounds
were
familiar
except
things
were
significantly
more
intense
and
i
felt
a
commotion


i
believe
in
layers
there
is
the
physical/material
layer
which
we
see
on
a
day
to
day
then
there
is
the
energy
realm
which
is
where
wed
see
chakra
systems
and
meridians
and
those
alex
grey
paintings
we
love
so
much
then
i
believed
there
was
the
dmt
layer
the
onset
was
very
much
like
curtains
revealing
the
layers
one
by
one
and
when
i
got
to
the
dmt
layer
that
very
fabric
was
being
ripped
apart
and
i
honestly
freaked
out
the
beautiful
palace
that
is
revealed
on
dmt
was
being
split
right
down
the
middle
by
a
piercing
white
light
i
felt
the
tension
of
the
final
layer
of
reality
i
felt
it
tear
right
down
the
middle
and
i
went
on
a
downward
spiral
from
there
my
very
essence
this
goes
beyond
visuals
began
to
break
down
and
i
watched
all
that
i
am
poof
off
into
fractals
until
there
was
nothing
but
white
very
quickly
i
watched
myself
be
reassimilated
and
i
opened
my
eyes
to
find
the
room
disintegrating
into
the
void
and
just
as
quickly
my
whole
essence
and
consciousness
split
up
into
little
fractals
and
there
was
nothing
but
void
then
quickly
everything
came
back
together
this
cycle
kept
repeating
over
and
over
over
and
over
being
torn
apart
and
rebuilt

this
went
beyond
sensations
and
visuals
my
ability
to
think
would
break
off
into
a
fractal
and
disappear
into
the
void
the
ability
to
perceive
would
break
off
into
a
fractal
and
disappear
into
the
void
i
kept
thinking
this
was
it
i
went
too
far
i
peered
too
deep
i
kept
trying
to
tell
myself
that
things
will
be
okay
tomorrow
but
the
very
concept
of
tomorrow
would
be
ripped
away
i
thought
of
my
family
and
that
would
get
ripped
away
i
started
thinking
about
everything
i
hold
dear
and
that
would
get
ripped
away
i
came
to
terms
with
my
death
but
even
that
would
get
ripped
away
i
felt
like
i
was
going
to
be
stuck
in
the
constant
build/rebuilding
process
forever
part
of
the
issues
was
that
it
was
happening
so
fast
there
was
no
space
to
get
comfortable
anytime
i
would
focus
on
a
visual
on
an
idea
on
a
concept
it
would
fractal
off
and
drag
me
into
the
void
with
it

i
somehow
crawled
over
to
momo
and
placed
my
head
on
her
lap
talking
was
impossible
save
a
few
grunts
of
desperation
moving
was
beyond
me
she
noticed
that
things
took
a
bad
turn
she
put
her
hands
on
me
and
began
to
repeat
\x93breath
in
love
exhale
gratitude
breath
in
love
exhale
gratitude
her
voice
and
being
able
to
kind
of
see
her
behind
the
crazy
wall
of
dmt
visuals
felt
like
the
only
connection
to
human-life
as
i
knew
it
controlling
my
breath
was
difficult
and
would
be
calming
for
a
few
seconds
before
reality
would
disassemble
again

after
what
seemed
like
an
eternity
but
turned
out
to
be
a
few
minutes
she
helped
me
get
to
a
bed
in
the
other
room
i
dont
remember
the
journey
to
the
bed
except
strange
bubbly
cones
floating
in
salvador-dali
meets
futuristic
computer
animations
kind
of
reminded
me
of
trippy
screen
savers
back
from
window
98
i
lay
in
bed
for
a
while
unable
to
move
i
was
beginning
to
get
used
to
the
assembly/disassembly
of
reality
but
it
had
in
no
way
reduced
in
intensity

i
was
beginning
to
get
used
to
the
assembly/disassembly
of
reality
but
it
had
in
no
way
reduced
in
intensity

i
started
gaining
awareness
of
my
body
for
the
first
time
since
it
began
it
felt
like
surges
of
electricity
were
traveling
through
me
i
could
feel
and
see
sparks
and
tingles
pulsing
through
me


i
was
still
in
a
state
of
fear
and
panic
thinking
was
still
near
impossible
but
here
is
where
the
learning
began
i
want
to
note
that
in
every
other
psychedelic
experience
ive
had
no
matter
how
fully
the
void
presented
itself
there
was
always
a
presence
in
this
void
there
was
no
presence
there
was
no
mother
of
father
or
ancestors
presence
there
was
literally
nothing
i
realized
that
i
was
worrying
about
people
close
to
me
i
started
realizing
that
as
i
was
being
disassembled
the
last
things
i
was
able
to
hold
on
to
were
those
things
i
valued
but
then
even
those
things
were
ripped
away
it
got
to
the
point
that
i
was
seeking
comfort
in
the
ability
to
think
and
perceive
and
even
that
was
ripped
away
i
was
sure
something
in
my
brain
short-circuited

the
experienced
started
to
lessen
but
still
no
assurance
of
it
passing
soon
we
had
ordered
food
for
pick
up
before
the
blast
off
and
while
they
said
itd
be
ready
in
20min
im
sure
by
now
half
an
hour
had
passed
i
was
able
to
kind
of
talk
now
i
was
entering
a
more
familiar
place
but
still
in
complete
and
utter
shock
everything
was
still
being
periodically
broken
apart
into
nothing
and
then
back
together
again
momo
realized
i
was
easing
out
and
said
asked
if
i
was
okay
to
be
left
alone
so
she
could
go
get
the
food
i
agreed
and
just
asked
for
my
phone
she
left
and
i
managed
to
dial
my
girlfriend
because
at
that
moment
all
my
entire
being
desired
was
comfort
my
phone
was
coming
apart
and
coming
back
together
too
somehow
i
managed
to
get
in
contact
with
her
and
i
closed
my
eyes
and
began
to
speak

words
have
never
left
my
mouth
in
such
fluidity
and
grace
i
quickly
told
her
what
i
had
taken
and
a
brief
explanation
of
what
i
was
feeling
and
of
my
panic
i
explained
to
her
that
there
is
no
i
all
we
are
is
a
vantage
point
of
observation
we
are
not
beings
being
shaped
by
experiences
we
are
the
experiences
we
are
not
being
conditioned
we
are
the
conditions
without
conditions
and
beliefs
there
is
no
experience
there
is
nothing
we
set
up
the
conditions
through
which
the
universe
and
existence
can
express
itself
through
the
people
we
surround
ourselves
with
give
us
the
illusion
that
there
is
an
individual
but
really
all
we
are
is
the
experiences
and
bonds
we
share
with
those
people
i
realized
that
everything
that
i
thought
i
was
being
disintegrated
into
nothingness
and
at
the
end
all
that
was
left
was
a
point
of
reference
for
the
universe
to
experience
through
but
without
conditions
there
was
nothing
to
experience

talking
was
so
alleviating
i
would
close
my
eyes
and
become
the
words
which
took
away
from
the
experience
of
disassembly
even
though
my
words
and
train
of
through
would
spiral
off
into
a
fractal
and
i
would
have
to
pause
to
regain
the
ability
to
start
forming
words
again
so
many
emotions
came
through
some
tears
some
laughing
much
talk
about
my
relationship
with
my
family
and
general
comfort
we
spoke
of
the
sanskrit
word
sat
which
means
truth
that
was
resonating
so
much
as
she
would
recite
the
mantra
sat
chit
ananda
truth
consciousness
bliss
when
truth
and
consciousness
are
combined
bliss
is
experienced
sat
nam
sat
nam
sat
nam
i
kept
repeating
for
a
while
the
embodiment
of
truth


after
some
time
of
talking
the
cycling
stopped
i
felt
much
more
present
much
more
intact
i
opened
my
eyes
and
things
were
much
more
familiar
a
nice
blend
of
the
syrian
rue
from
where
it
was
before
the
dmt
with
a
very
profound
ayahuasca
touch
momo
got
back
with
the
food
i
handed
her
the
phone
and
she
spoke
to
my
girlfriend
for
a
bit
while
i
recollected
myself
i
got
up
and
stretched
around
trails
lingering
but
i
was
just
so
happy
to
be
back
on
ground
zero
never
felt
so
happy
to
not
be
tripping
i
checked
out
the
clock
towards
the
end
of
the
conversation
on
the
phone
and
it
was

745pm
i
checked
the
phone
later
and
my
call
went
out
at
about
700pm
which
means
the
intense
peak
reached
a
plateau
for
about
30min
before
i
was
able
to
verbalize
to
momo
that
i
was
okay
and
was
able
to
utilize
a
phone
the
fractalization
of
reality
lasted
most
of
the
conversation
so
i
would
say
the
come-down
was
about
30min
and
lingered
for
another
30min
total
time
for
the
dmt
portion
15hrs


800pm

i
felt
pretty
normal
a
feel
good
similar
to
low
dose
of
mushrooms
mind
completely
blown
by
the
experience

heart
overwhelmed
by
gratitude
for
all
those
around
me
and
every
being
that
has
crossed
my
path
and
allowed
me
to
experience
this
life
i
realized
so
much
about
myself
about
my
values
about
the
fragility
of
life
about
conditions
and
the
truth
of
this
human
experience


in
hindsight
it
was
the
most
enlightening
and
cleansing
experience
i
have
ever
lived
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
but
with
more
mental
preparation

i
would
definitely
try
it
again
but
with
more
mental
preparation

knowing
what
i
know
now
i
believe
the
experience
would
have
been
more
enjoyable
and
easier
to
digest
i
do
acknowledge
that
fear
got
a
hold
of
me
i
lost
my
footing
and
the
panic
affected
the
ability
to
observe
and
take
in
the
experience
but
that
is
what
i
needed
sometimes
we
do
need
to
feel
fear
to
be
reminded
of
the
genuine
and
simple
appreciation
of
this
life
i
thank
momo
with
all
my
heart
for
the
comfort
and
compassion
she
provided
during
the
experience

two
days
have
passed
since
the
experience
still
somewhat
in
shock
occasional
but
slight
flashbacks
of
the
void
and
all
the
layers
in
between
intensely
patterned
clothing
has
been
over-stimulating
and
evokes
the
omnipresent
presence
of
the
void

aho
creator
thank
you
for
this
experience

thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
read
through
this
experience

i
had
been
holding
onto
two
dmt
rocks
for
a
couple
of
months
waiting
for
the
right
time
to
use
them

i
had
tried
to
smoke
dmt
twice
before
but
with
only
marginal
results

the
first
two
experiences
produced
only
mild
psychedelic
effects
electric
sensations
flowing
through
the
body
and
visuals
a
kin
to
lsd
or
mushrooms

my
ego
had
been
left
completely
intact
in
both
cases
and
i
had
never
really
left
the
rooms
from
which
i
attempted
to
launch

early
in
the
evening
i
decided
to
attempt
a
new
launch

my
roommate
echo
was
djing
a
party
somewhere
and
my
house
was
otherwise
empty

just
after
dark
i
set
up
my
zone
stringing
my
hammock
up
between
two
trees
in
my
back
yard

i
lit
two
sticks
of
incense
at
the
base
of
the
two
trees
and
settled
into
my
hammock

i
had
decided
to
smoke
the
dmt
using
my
vapor
genie
by
placing
the
smaller
60
mg
rock
directly
on
the
vg
screen

in
the
minutes
before
launch
i
attempted
to
meditate
following
my
breath
this
was
very
difficult
as
my
mind
kept
bringing
me
back
to
the
idea
of
the
approaching
trip

many
report
that
dmt
is
very
intense
and
as
i
had
taken
mushrooms
and
lsd
at
what
i
considered
high
doses
several
times
before
i
had
at
least
some
shadow
of
an
idea
what
i
was
getting
myself
into



as
i
held
the
vg
up
to
my
face
my
heart
rate
increased
noticeably

i
became
short
of
breath
and
felt
quite
nervous

i
began
to
hit
the
vg
but
my
lungs
protested
against
the
very
slow
hot
stream
of
air
and
demanded
oxygen

i
stopped
mid-inhale
and
gasped
for
air

holding
the
lighter
back
to
the
vg
i
began
to
hear
the
subtle
sound
of
the
solid
dmt
popping
and
whistling
its
way
into
a
liquid
and
the
sizzling
sound
of
vaporization

i
continued
hitting
the
vg
but
never
really
felt
a
concentrated
hit

after
about
60
seconds
of
hitting
the
pipe
i
laid
back
in
my
hammock

i
felt
only
very
mild
effects
not
even
close
to
what
i
had
felt
on
my
previous
two
attempts

somewhat
disappointed
i
pulled
out
my
glass
pipe
and
took
a
few
tokes
of
cannabis
before
falling
into
a
peaceful
slumber

i
slept
for
a
couple
of
hours
waking
to
a
rekindled
desire
to
attempt
a
launch

i
like
to
consider
myself

a


truth
seeker
willing
to
weather
the
uncertainty
of
alternative
and
expanded
awareness
in
the
attempt
to
contact
and
understand
a
more
fundamental
reality

given
an
adequately
prepared
set
an
appropriate
setting
the
right
tools
and
the
right
chemical
key
a
curious
psychonaut
will
seize
the
opportunity
for
learning
in
spite
of
his
nerves
and
reservations
about
the
unknown

with
newfound
resolve
i
took
my
vg
inside
to
reload

upon
taking
it
apart
i
found
a
black
gooey
substance
caked
all
over
the
screen
effectively
clogging
the
pipe

after
removing
the
screen
i
found
the
same
gunk
running
down
into
the
stem
of
the
pipe

the
rock
i
had
placed
in
the
bowl
was
completely
gone
but
had
evidently
liquified
and
ran
through
the
vg
screen

i
replaced
the
screen
with
a
new
one
laid
a
thin
bed
of
cannabis

and
placed
the
larger
170
mg
rock
of
yellow-white
dmt
upon
it

i
hoped
the
cannabis
would
catch
the
liquified
dmt
before
it
ran
through
the
screen
and
away
from
my
heat
source



during
this
process
my
roommate
echo
returned
home
from
his
dj
gig

i
told
him
i
was
preparing
to
relaunch
and
i
asked
him
to
serve
as
my
guide

ive
had
mushroom
and
lsd
experiences
by
myself
several
times
before
and
i
knew
i
could
very
likely
handle
this
experience
alone
but
deep
down
something
told
me
that
securing
echo
as
my
guide
was
the
right
thing
to
do

we
went
out
to
the
back
yard
and
i
relit
two
new
sticks
of
incense
at
my
hammock
zone

echo
sat
in
a
chair
facing
the
side
of
my
hammock

the
cherried
incense
glowed
orange
through
the
darkness
and
i
was
comforted
by
its
familiar
aroma

i
settled
back
into
my
hammock
covering
my
lower
half
with
a
blanket
and
holding
the
vg
and
lighter
up
to
my
face

the
nerves
came
back

my
heart
rate
increased
and
i
felt
starved
for
oxygen

again
i
took
a
few
minutes
to
consciously
slow
down
and
focus
on
my
breathing

i
was
a
rocket
quietly
posed
on
a
launch
pad
awaiting
the
inevitable
ignition
sequence

see
you
in
eternity
echo
said
as
i
flicked
my
lighter
and
held
the
flame
to
the
vg

again
i
could
hear
the
popping
and
sizzling
of
the
vaporizing
rock
but
this
time
i
got
a
concentrated
vapor
hit
complete
with
that
subtle
plastic
taste
i
had
encountered
on
my
previous
attempts

i
exhaled
the
white
vapor
and
went
back
for
a
second
toke

my
body
began
to
buzz
with
the
familiar
electricity

this
buzz
kept
growing
in
intensity
through
the
hit
and
by
the
time
i
exhaled
and
began
the
third
toke
it
was
growing
with
such
momentum
i
knew
this
attempt
would
succeed

i
continued
inhaling
despite
the

electricity
now
surging
through
my
body

the
third
toke
gave
me
what
felt
like
the
thickest
hit
yet
and
as
i
blew
out
the
column
of
plastic
vapor
i
fell
softly
back
into
my
hammock
body
and
mind
disintegrating
into
a
billion
disconnected
pieces
scattered
across
the
face
of
oblivion


after
body
and
psyche
are
broken
down
and
blasted
out
in
all
directions
there
is
only
emptiness

this
is
the
clear
light
of
the
unformed
the
un-become

there
is
in
fact
no
experience
here
that
the
psyche
can
preserve
in
memory

this
state
coincides
with
the
death
of
the
ego
and
a
discontinuity
of
recorded
experience

it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
say
how
much
earth
time
elapsed
during
this
state
of
freedom
later
echo
would
tell
me
the
silence
lasted
around
10
minutes

the
first
flash
of
experience
is
a
recognition
of
falling
out
of
this
emptiness

only
after
slipping
out
of
the
void
can
any
conscious
recognition
occur

as
the
clear
light
slipped
away
i
recognized
it
as
sheer
perfection



it
is
identified
as
divine
bliss
a
state
completely
devoid
of
imperfections
impermanence
or
dissatisfaction
of
any
kind

it
lacks
any
hint
of
duality
or
ego
and
has
a
distinct
impersonal
quality



just
after
falling
out
of
the
light
i
felt
i
had
an
opportunity
to
return
to
it

this
window
is
quite
small
however
since
the
fall
out
of
the
light
is
like
the
falling
of
an
object
toward
the
earth

at
first
the
object
falls
slowly
enough
energy
directed
upward
may
overcome
the
downward
motion
and
return
the
object
to
its
original
position
but
after
some
time
the
object
gathers
too
much
momentum
and
there
is
no
reversing
the
fall




the
psyche
pulls
at
one
in
the
same
way
that
gravity
pulls
a
falling
object

the
initial
flash
of
recognition
is
produced
by
the
first
shred
of
the
psyche
reinstating
itself

as
this
piece
solidifies
other
pieces
begin
to
solidify
around
it

as
more
pieces
of
the
psyche
fall
into
place
the
self-reconstruction
process
accelerates
like
an
avalanche

timely
application
of
just
the
right
kind
of
concentrated
energy
could
reverse
this
avalanche
and
return
one
to
the
liberation
of
the
clear
light

however
in
my
case
the
pull
of
my
ego
is
strong
and
familiar
and
affinity
for
the
habitual
inevitably
pulled
me
away
from
the
impersonal
void
and
back
into
the
process
of
reconstructing
my
psyche

almost
the
same
instant
that
i
realized
what
was
happening
i
knew
that
i
had
fallen
past
the
point
of
no
return

the
momentum
of
my
fall
back
into
the
ego
was
too
strong
to
overcome

i
began
to
fall
through
a
sea
of
imagery
collected
during
my
current
life

all
the
people
places
ideas
and
symbols
ive
come
to
know
were
interlocking
and
flowing
freely
like
a
fluid

i
experienced
this
vast
sea
of
imagery
outside
of
time
holding
all
of
the
pieces
in
awareness
simultaneously

its
scope
and
beauty
were
absolutely
overwhelming



during
this
period
i
experienced
several
profound
philosophical
realizations

i
could
see
that
the
emptiness
from
which
i
had
fallen
was
the
fundamental
state
of
perfection
in
the
cosmos

all
efforts
to
make
ones
own
life
as
well
as
others
lives
better
culminate
in
this
state

it
is
the
attractor
and
the
end
of
time
pulling
the
individual
and
the
whole
of
life
toward
its
perfection

i
felt
that
the
purpose
of
experiencing
life
is
to
cultivate
the
qualities
and
skill
necessary
to
find
the
clear
light
and
to
stay
in
it
without
falling
back
into
routine
ego-dominated
reality

this
applies
to
the
individual
as
well
as
the
collective
of
all
living
beings

i
saw
that
the
cultivation
of
good
mental
qualities
are
essential
to
the
process

intelligence
concentration
and
ultimately
wisdom
are
all
necessary
to
make
and
then
maintain
contact
with
the
clear
light

in
addition
compassionate
behavior
or
right
action
on
the
individual
and
the
collective
scale
is
also
essential
to
the
attainment
and
preservation
of
divine
bliss

these
realizations
felt
like
sacred
gifts
bestowed
upon
me
by
the
experience

in
my
routine
ego
personality
i
consider
myself
to
know
these
things
already

i
attempt
to
study
and
understand
the
teachings
of
the
buddha
and
practice
meditation
although
the
turbulence
of
life
often
distracts
me
from
these
efforts
and
too
often
i
find
myself
wrapped
in
the
business
of
seeking
out
sense
pleasures

experiencing
the
falling
from
the
clear
light
and
re-learning
the
significance
and
purpose
of
spiritual
endeavors
like
the
cultivation
of
good
mental
qualities
and
the
performing
of
right
actions
on
some
very
deep
and
real
level
of
my
psyche
are
invaluable

this
kind
of
intensely
felt
experience
serves
to
keep
me
in
touch
with
what
is
most
important
in
life
and
what
is
the
closest
expression
of
my
true
unimpeded
nature

after
descending
through
the
glistening
sea
of
symbols
and
imagery
i
began
to
encounter
some
turbulence

as
the
psyche
reconstructs
itself
it
becomes
more
and
more
fixed
and
solid
in
contrast
to
the
complete
lack
of
form
of
the
void
and
the
flowing
fluid
nature
of
the
sea
of
imagery

there
is
a
tension
felt
around
the
crystalized
parts
of
the
psyche
as
the
more
fluid
parts
flow
by
lapping
and
swirling
into
turbulent
eddies

as
i
felt
this
tension
building
in
intensity
i
remember
uttering
the
name
of
my
most
trusted
teacher
ww

her
name
serves
me
as
protector
during
the
unsteady
phases
of
my
psychedelic
voyages

as
more
and
more
of
my
psyche
crystalized
into
a
recognizable
human
form
my
awareness
across
the
sea
of
imagery
began
to
hone
in
on
one
particular
set
of
images

soon
i
was
surrounded
by
the
naked
bodies
of
copulating
couples

i
did
not
experience
attraction
or
desire
toward
these
images
as
i
have
before
on
lsd
i
was
simply
an
impartial
observer

suddenly
i
felt
an
intense
connection
with
my
own
biological
mother
i
felt
her
presence
and
noted
the
bond
of
love
flowing
from
me
to
her
and
from
her
to
me

i
realized
that
i
was
being
cradled
by
the
warm
fleshy
interior
of
a
womb

i
sat
up
in
my
hammock
pulling
myself
into
the
fetal
position



i
could
see
my
physical
surroundings
for
the
first
time
but
i
was
bathed
in
softly
enchanting
red
purple
and
blue
light

soon
i
felt
the
enchanting

light
slipping
away
leaving
in
its
place
a
deep
sense
of
renewed
purity

i
had
been
reborn

then
i
wept

i
wept
and
wept
with
joy
and
gratitude

i
was
back

i
wept
and
wept
with
joy
and
gratitude

i
was
back



between
sobs
of
joy
i
managed
to
articulate
thank
you
echo

i
didnt
know
how
to
explain
to
him
how
helpful
and
critical
his
quiet
grounded
presence
was
to
my
experience

the
role
of
the
psychedelic
guide
is
complex
and
beautiful

somehow
his
grounded
non-doing
presence
serves
to
facilitate
the
smooth
passing
of
the
voyager
through
the
various
phases
of
the
experience

i
silently
honored
my
earlier
intuition
to
request
his
service
as
guide
to
my
session

gradually
my
sobs
became
more
like
laughter

the
distinction
is
subtle
anyway

i
was
awed
by
the
eery
familiarity
of
the
entire
death
and
rebirth
process
as
if
i
had
experienced
it
countless
times
before

the
dmt
death
and
rebirth
experience
had
just
confirmed
what
i
already
knew
deep
down

the
purpose
of
life
is
to
make
life
better
for
oneself
and
all
other
beings

this
gradual
incremental
process
of
making
life
better
a
tiny
bit
at
a
time
culminates
in
the
divine
bliss
felt
just
after
the
break
up
of
the
body
and
psyche

this
state
of
un-become
perfection
is
the
attractor
at
the
end
of
cosmic
time

to
recognize
it
and
to
maintain
it
requires
the
systematic
development
of
good
mental
qualities
like
concentration
and
awareness

it
also
requires
the
performance
of
compassionate
actions
in
the
physical
world

these
efforts
made
diligently
enough
shall
deliver
the
individual
and
the
collective
of
all
life
in
the
cosmos
into
the
divine
state
of
perfection

into
the
mind
of
god

this
first
true
breakthrough
dmt
experience
contained
at
least
as
much
depth
as
ive
found
in
the
peaks
of
my
high
dose
mushroom
and
lsd
experiences
but
with
a
laser-like
succinctness

the
main
distinction
i
notice
is
the
duration

the
entire
experience
is
condensed

the
various
aspects
of
the
experience
flow
by
at
mind
numbing
speed
making
it
potentially
even
more
difficult
to
retain
and
integrate
any
lessons
learned
or
realizations
attained

the
retainable
content
of
the
experience
begins
only
after
one
falls
out
of
the
void
and
lasts
through
the
rebirth
back
into
the
familiar
personality

this
fall
takes
only
a
few
minutes
to
bring
the
voyager
all
the
way
back
to
baseline
routine
reality



after
reflecting
on
my
experience
i
returned
to
my
bedroom
and
slipped
into
a
peaceful
slumber

by
the
next
morning
as
i
write
this
account
the
original
content
of
the
deeply
felt
philosophical
realizations
has
all
but
faded

i
am
left
with
the
words
i
used
to
articulate
the
realizations
and
the
memory
that
these
words
were
connected
to
a
very
real
profound
experience

time
will
reveal
how
this
dmt
trip
will
affect
my
choices
as
a
human
being
navigating
through
the
dream
we
all
call
routine
waking
reality

setting

a

converted
to
a

containing
a

extra
comfy
sectional
couch
computer/desk/chair

very
comfy
very
friendy

experience

t-0000h
after
first
0166mg
oral
dose
was
taken
a
slight
an
almost
unnoticable
bitter
taste
was
present
and
caused
the
tongue
to
experience
a
cooling
effect
like
winterfresh

t-0025h
no
oevs
or
cevs
a
hightened
sense
of
color/smell
was
deffinitely
noted
along
with
relieving
previously
clogged
nostrils
and
clear
headed
feelings
but
no
stimulation

t-0100h
no
oevs
or
cevs
present
but
deffinitely
on
verge
of
shining
through
nice
color
and
detail
of
nature
this
is
known
because
of
going
outside
to
pee
the
effects
of
first
dose
were
at
peak
light
and
color
sensitivity
a
35
out
of
10
smell
great
marijuana
seemed
absolutely
fantastic
even
tho
it
was
already
very
good
even
if
not
already
altered
this
seemed
to
bring
out
a
very
nice
feeling
and
ever
so
slight
stimulation
combined
with
increased
giggles
and
laughter
the
effects
felt
very
warm
and
comfortable
like
a
low
dose
of
a
tryptamine
like
4-ho-met
so
a
second
oral
dose
was
taken

t-0175h
slight
oevs
similar
to
a
0100mg
of
lsd-25
&
4-ho-dmt
where
as
the
waving
and
squiggles
in
patterns
were
like
psilocin
and
there
was
a
breathing
of
walls
and
cubical
objects
were
closer
to
acid
the
second
dose
seemed
to
be
at
peak
resulting
in
a
very
happy
giggly
feeling
not
much
more
stimulation
tho
along
with
a
very
light
floaty
feeling
like
mdma
or
mephedrone
if
you
arent
familiar
with
true
e
marijuana
seems
to
bring
out
the
best
qualities
in
this
compound
and
keep
its
warmth
smoking
still
allows
you
to
be
high
and
silly
from
weed
but
the
sleepy
body
high
and
feeling
from
cbd
and
cbcs
from
bud
were
gone
i
wouldnt
do
with
out
but
anyways
a
third
oral
dose
was
administered

t-0350h
high
and
euphoria
seemed
to
peak
from
third
dose
there
is
noticably
more
stimulation
and
drive
to
explore
have
fun
and
meet
people
maybe
eat
something
but
not
like
a
rush
just
brighter
happiness
is
phenominal
at
this
point
a
permanent
smile
was
plastered
on
all
three
faces
oevs
and
cevs
were
pretty
much
same
just
more
pronounceds
especially
brathing
and
stretching
even
tho
itd
never
be
tested
by
me
i
feel
at
this
dose
driving
abilities
would
actually
be
uneffected
but
dont
test
this
on
my
word
we
walked
to
a
near
by
wendys
it
was
pretty
dark
and
car
lights
streaked
by
nicely
leaving
short
sharp
trails
hunger
wasnt
present
but
when
finally
inside
wendys
the
urge
to
taste
on
this
substance
was
huge
and
i
devoured
a
large
choc/vanilla
frosty
10
nuggets

and
a
medium
fry
amazing
sense
of
taste
on
this
molecule
as
if
every
ingredient
is
individualy
identified
after
returning
to
the
garage
intranasal
doses
of
0332mg
2ml
were
administered
to
self
and
one
other
subect
others
were
happy
at
that
dose
but
my
friend
and
i
were
hoping
for
a
4+
on
the
scale
and
were
fairly
comfortable
with/on
it
so
up
the
shoot
and
almost
no
feeling
but
a
slight
cooling
and
numbing
actually
felt
great
rush
immediate
almost
from
this
very
similar
to
the
first
bump
of
methamphetamine
nice
not
fast
or
dirty
or
sweaty

t-0400h
right
on
verge
of
4+
streching
amplified
music
dissected
and
reorginzed
very
very
very
very
beautiful
soft
medium
paced
cevs
very
vibrant
and
warm
almost
intysing
one
to
fall
alseep
and
add
homegrow
dmt
[erowid
note
we
have
no
idea
what
this
refers
to]
to
the
mix
haha
everything
immediately
in
direct
bery
was
detailed
crisp
and
undistorted
as
patterns
and
prisms
of
color
and
wiggles
party
in
360
degrees
periferal
vison
like
a
tunnel

t-0500h
my
brave
friend
on
my
level
looks
at
me
very
stern
yet
unconcerned
and
serious
at
the
same
time
and
says
reality
just
hit
you
in
the
face
didnt
it
i
look
up
and
simply
respond
yes
with
a
grin
on
my
face
at
the
very
moment
it
happened
a
spark
in
the
back
of
my
head
a
buzz
started
to
spread
over
my
skin
exactly
like
lsd-25
that
cold
heat
buzz
and
tingle
this
extraordinary
feeling
was
accompanied
by
a
rush
of
euphoria
and
excitement
like
candy
flipping
taking
mdma
and
lsd-25
together
i
have
to
say
most
unexperienced
psychonauts
would
be
more
than
overwhelmed
at
this
point
but
this
was
the
peak
of
a
mountain
ive
trained
and
prepared
for
and
was
expecting
and
my
friend
he
is
just
a
damn
trooper
haha
and
loved
it
anywho
this
skin
buzz
grew
and
grew
and
grew
where
there
was
a
point
i
recalculated
the
doses
furiously
wondering
had
i
taken
too
much
should
i
be
in
a
safer
place
before
i
reach
its
true
peak
and
lose
touch
with
reality
100%
for
the
first
time
am
i
really
ready
for
this
and
then
it
happened

th
i
felt
as
if
i
opened
my
eyes
for
the
first
time
and
was
suspended
in
what
seemed
to
represent
space
my
friends
were
still
visible
and
seemed
to
be
there
in
the
same
floating
upright
posture
with
closed
eyes
and
gentle
smiles
and
then
i
began
to
witness
an
ugly
side
of
this
other
worldly
suspension
to
skin
buzz
on
my
back
facing
what
was
to
me
the
appitomy
of
emptiness
a
grew
cold
and
consuming
as
if
it
was
pulling
me
into
a
cold
burning
frying
pan
and
never
let
me
return
to
normal


but
i
felt
as
if
i
was
responsible
for
the
comfort
and
safety
of
my
subjects
and
managed
to
break
away
from
this
feeling
and
escape
hitting
the
invisible
frying
pan
i
then
realized
or
think
i
had
my
eyes
closed
during
that
and
when
i
escaped
it
i
simply
opened
my
eyes
at
this
point
i
thought
i
felt
sober
for
the
most
part
and
started
to
feel
a
depressant
feeling
like
a
warm
opiate
buzz
probly
due
to
even
more
marijuana
being
consumed
a
quarter
of
very
high
quality
bud
by
pretty
much
just
me
over
the
whole
night
they
arent
big
smokers
so
to
walk
off
and
celebrate
my
escape
i
go
outside
with
the
group
after
convincing
them
to
follow
after
walking
around
and
discussing
this
new
fantastic
compound
i
got
the
urge
to
go
home
to
chill
with
my
brother
and
try
and
sleep
i
felt
a
tad
exhausted
it
was
around
130am
i
took
the
first
dose
at
like
500pm
i
told
the
group
i
was
going
to
walk
home
home
is
exactly
3miles
away
after
reaching
the
main
street
a
block
a
way
looking
down
the
street
and
watching
it
strech
and
wiggle
made
me
realize
i
was
still
high
so
i
decided
to
return
to
the
garage
and
be
safe
and
have
my
brother
pick
me
up
after
getting
home
i
was
at
10%
of
the
peak
oevs
i
couldnt
stand
cartoons
they
light
weight
scared
me
and
movies
were
nice
and
empothatic
like
watching
movies
on
e
more
weed
consumed
more
sleepy
warm
feeling
my
cat
laid
on
my
chest
puring
which
caused
me
to
fully
realx
after
sitting
up
and
cracking
my
back
i
lay
back
down
reposition
molly

my
serval
cat
shes
huge
35lbs
and
slim
lol
and
drift
away


amazing
dreams
indistinguishable
from
reality

after
waking
up
i
feel
light
still
and
a
lil
happier
than
usual
no
headache
or
drag
my
pupils
were
very
tiny
where
as
they
were
huge
at
the
peak
and
an
important
note

i
noticed
when
i
forgot
to
drink
for
about
two
hours
after
my
second
dose
my
veins
began
to
constrict
and
as
soon
as
fluids
gatorade
were
ingested
this
was
reversed
but
all
in
all
its
very
nice
and
seem
to
have
lit
physical
side
effects
id
have
to
say
its
like
lsd-25
and
mdma
in
one
godly
compound
i
put
its
max
safe
fun
dose
at
0850mg
taken
as
i
have
or
0750mg
oral
at
once
and
0475mg
nasally
at
once




i
consider
myself
an
intrepid
but
cautious
and
scientific
psychonaut
taking
low
doses
at
first
and
gently
exploring
my
way
into
higher
doses
of
lsd
psilocybin
salvia
2-c-b
and
\x93ecstasy
whatever
md*
compound
and/or
misc
uppers
those
pills
might
have
been
if
i
had
to
estimate
i
would
say
i
have
taken
psychedelics
on
between
20-40
occasions
in
the
past
10
years
and
never
had
a
bad
trip
having
recently
helped
my
friend
freddie
extract
and
purify
dmt
from
a
botanical
source
i
found
myself
in
a
position
to
experiment
after
5+
years
of
reading
and
preparing
my
psyche
to
do
dmt
i
took
multiple
threshold
doses
to
familiarize
my
body
with
the
physiological
effects
of
this
chemical
i
also
took
2
larger
doses
one
with
a
sitter
which
was
satisfactory
but
alien
and
one
alone
which
caused
a
bit
of
panic

i
decided
i
would
smoke
dmt
alone
this
night
again
even
though
the
last
time
i
used
it
alone
was
a
mildly
frightening
but
completely
satisfying
experience
this
is
only
the
3rd
time
i
have
taken
dmt
above
a
threshold
dose
i
prepared
my
\x93launch
pad

lighting

it
is
dark
outside
so
there
will
be
no
natural
light
on
this
trip
primary
lighting
is
from
my
55gal
turtle
tank
with
a
48
black-light
providing
supplemental
lighting
in
a
corner
of
the
room
i
also
allowed
full
incandescent
light
in
the
hallway
leading
to
the
bathroom
and
my
bedroom
which
bled
out
considerably
to
my
\x93launch
pad

seating

ive
placed
my
beanbag
full
of
memory
foam
in
front
of
the
turtle
tank
knowing
that
my
eyes
if
i
open
them
will
be
drawn
to
the
primary
light
source
anyway
i
also
spent
a
good
5
minutes
imprinting
a
comfortable
butt-print
into
the
bag
to
eliminate
the
need
to
re-situate
myself
while
riding
the
chemical
rocketship
that
i
will
soon
prepare
in
the
relaxed
\x93ride
it
out
position
my
eyes
are
level
with
the
bottom
of
the
tank
and
the
waters
surface
is
roughly
20
inches
above
them

having
had
a
frightening
but
wonderfully
comforting
dmt
experience
involving
a
very
familiar
movie
i
elected
to
forgo
any
recognizable
outside
audio
the
only
thing
to
be
heard
was
the
sound
of
the
turtle
tanks
gentle
waterfall
and
the
occasional
car
outside

dose
prep

i
wound
a
thin
strip
of
day-glo
orange
duct
tape
around
the
stem
of
my
favorite
cheap
bubbler
to
remind
me
that
i
would
now
contain
dmt
residue
forevermore
into
the
bowl
i
placed
a
wire
screen
and
added
an
amount
of
cannabis
i
could
easily
smoke
and
would
probably
be
dissatisfied
with
in
1
hit
from
my
supply
of
dmt
which
is
so
close
to
white
you
hardly
notice
it
isnt
i
raked
out
a
loose
pile
about
the
size
of
a
dime
that
is
to
say
all
the
dmt
i
put
in
the
pipe
this
night
would
have
fit
inside
an
american
dime
i
then
added
about
the
same
amount
of
ganja
as
went
on
the
screen
and
compressed
the
mixture
lightly
one
more
pinch
of
cannabis
and
more
light
pressure
completed
the
preparation
of
my
chemical
rocketship
by
eyeball
i
could
easily
smoke
this
amount
of
just
cannabis
in
3
hits
or
less
regretfully
i
do
not
have
a
0001g
scale
so
i
can
only
estimate
the
empirical
weight
of
this
dose
by
comparing
it
visually
to
a
weigh-able
supply
i
estimate
very
approximately
that
i
used
at
most
25mg

companion

only
my
red-eared
slider
turtle
will
remain
in
\x93normal
space
to
watch
my
physical
body
which
i
will
soon
be
unconcerned
with
his
name
is
hiram
and
i
have
known
him
for
3
years
i
found
him
in
a
pet
store
when
he
was
an
inch
too
small
to
be
legally
sold
in
america
and
all
the
other
turtles
picked
on
him
i
felt
sorry
for
him
but
they
wouldnt
sell
him
to
me
so
i
bribed
an
employee
to
list
him
on
the
\x93dead
animals
write-off
sheet
and
give
him
to
me
i
know
hes
only
a
reptile
but
he
does
recognize
me
as
opposed
to
someone
who
doesnt
regularly
give
him
food
and
sometimes
i
swear
he
knows
and
is
thankful
that
i
saved
him
from
all
those
big
mean
guys
at
the
pet
store
i
take
care
of
him
and
he
takes
care
of
me

mental
state
prior
to
dose

i
am
apprehensive
this
is
to
be
my
first
solitary
dose
since
what
i
call
my
\x93frantic
gathering
&
retreat
trip
2
things
calm
my
mind
hiram
will
be
watching
me
this
time
and
i
am
taking
an
equivalent
volume
[not
weight
probably]
of
a
much
purer
product
i
recline
comfortably
on
my
bag
holding
my
bubbler
and
clearing
my
mind
breathing
deeply
i
recall
the
pure
child-like
joy
i
felt
last
time
i
did
this
when
i
realized
i
had
survived
i
am
excited
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
the
\x93entities
that
looked
directly
at
me
2
days
ago
and
decided
i
wasnt
ready
to
be
spoken
to
i
am
fearful
of
underestimating
my
dose
whether
by
purity
weight
or
residue
left
in
the
bubbler
from
earlier
dmt
uses
breathing
all
these
fears
and
expectations
out
as
a
putrid
chartreuse
vapor
with
a
final
deep
breath
i
strike
my
lighter
and
begin
to
inhale

dosing

i
light
1/3
of
the
bowls
surface
quickly
and
pull
gently
to
allow
the
heat
in
the
bowl
to
vaporize
the
dmt
as
opposed
to
the
heat
from
the
lighter
by
the
time
my
lungs
were
full
the
first
time
the
cherry
had
traveled
across
the
bowl
in
an
odd
way
i
attribute
this
to
the
fact
that
the
bowl
was
actually
a
parfait
of
different
substances
with
different
combustion
temperatures
i
hold
this
first
hit
for
a
long
time
it
has
the
classic
\x93tryptamine
taste
which
is
like
nothing
else
to
me
it
tastes
and
smells
like
fresh
aquarium
tubing
but
that
is
just
the
reference
point
for
my
brainwaves

by
the
time
i
exhaled
i
was
beginning
to
feel
abuzzingaround
the
bridge
of
my
nose
and
my
sinuses
knowing
i
was
coming
up
already
i
strove
to
smoke
as
much
as
i
could
i
was
considerably
more
aggressive
with
the
lighter
on
the
second
hit
and
probably
more
aggressive
with
my
inhalation
fear
took
over
again
at
this
point
as
i
thought
\x93what
have
i
done
to
myself
and
i
exhaled
much
sooner
than
i
could
have
looking
at
the
bowl
i
realized
that
it
looked
only
about
half
smoked
i
may
or
may
not
have
hit
it
a
3rd
time
in
a
halfhearted
way
i
remember
leaning
forward
to
set
the
bubbler
in
a
safe
place
and
as
i
leaned
back
to
settle
into
my
beanbag
the
\x93universe
dissolved
into
everythingness
[phrase
taken
directly
from
my
notes
and
this
is
still
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it]

coming
up

coming
up
on
dmt
is
powerful
and
terrifying
for
me
my
first
cue
that
something
is
different
is
abuzzing
that
i
feel
in
the
middle
of
my
face
and
a
taste
of
dmt
that
is
not
quite
taste
im
pretty
sure
i
would
taste
it
even
if
it
was
injected
then
the
mucous
membranes
in
my
mouth
and
throat
make
themselves
known
to
me
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
that
i
can
feel
diamond-shaped
crystals
1cm
across
forming
and
dissolving
all
over
anything
in
my
head
that
touches
saliva
this
is
intensely
pleasurable
in
an
odd
alien
sort
of
way
again
i
think
\x93what
have
i
done
to
myself
and
breathe
deeply
once
or
twice
the
feeling
of
air
filling
my
lungs
they
really
are
just
2
spongy
balloons
i
marvel
to
myself
is
spectacular
and
reminds
me
that
i
am
still
alive
i
imagine
that
what
i
am
experiencing
now
is
the
psychic
equivalent
of
what
astronauts
experience
during
lift-off
the
sounds
that
break
my
concentration
on
my
body
are
distorted
as
though
the
soundwaves
were
electronically
stretched
into
infinity
i
am
mildly
aware
of
my
surroundings
as
i
set
my
bubbler
down
the
turtle
tank
and
stand
is
in
front
of
me
black-light
to
my
left
and
hallway
to
my
right
and
suddenly
all
of
that
disappears
perhaps
i
closed
my
eyes
but
i
do
not
remember
doing
so

peak

i
find
myself
looking
down
from
great
height
on
a
house
at
night
i
hear
music
it
sounds
[and
feels
and
smells
and
tastes]
like
howard
shores
\x93shire
theme
from
peter
jacksons
lord
of
the
rings
but
infinitely
more
complex
i
have
come
to
realize
that
\x93hear
is
not
the
proper
verb
here
perhaps
\x93experience
is
better
as
i
was
aware
that
my
physical
\x93ears
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
music
as
soon
as
i
become
aware
of
this
music
and
even
while
i
am
still
making
the
lotr
and
non-heard
connections
my
perspective
begins
to
change
as
though
i
were
falling
though
i
feel
no
sensation
of
free-fall

soon
i
find
myself
looking
at
the
house
i
grew
up
in
from
a
vantage
point
of
10
feet
from
the
property
line
and
15
feet
up
the
music
swells
to
a
dynamic
peak
and
i
think
\x93im
home
i
feel
a
sense
of
homecoming
like
nothing
ive
ever
felt
before
like
when
you
return
to
a
beloved
child-hood
haunt
years
after
your
last
visit
but
magnified
10
times
even
though
it
is
night
in
this
vision
the
entire
landscape
is
colored
in
reds
greens
and
golds
the
same
colors
that
i
see
when
i
close
my
eyes
and
press
on
them

i
become
aware
of
the
turtle
tank
in
front
of
me
and
watch
hiram
dive
from
the
surface
30
degrees
to
my
right
all
the
way
to
eye
level
directly
in
front
of
me
i
am
comforted
by
the
fact
that
hiram
is
looking
right
at
me
though
i
cant
decide
if
his
tank
looks
like
it
is
made
of
fractals
or
is
an
impressionistic
painting
whether
fractals
or
monet
i
decide
it
is
among
the
top
5
most
beautiful
sights
i
have
ever
seen
nothing
else
in
my
relatively
well
lit
surroundings
enters
my
awareness

suddenly
i
am
viewing
the
same
scene
of
my
child-hood
home
again
it
looks
like
a
photograph
except
for
the
red
green
and
gold
color
palette
i
begin
to
realize
that
*something*
is
off
about
this
image
nothing
specific
just
a
sense
that
i
am
seeing
an
imperfect
image
i
came
to
realize
days
later
that
it
was
as
though
every
angle
was
perfect
in
the
3
dimensions
that
we
normally
see
but
90
degrees
\x93off
in
a
dimension
we
dont
[carl
h
claudys
\x93the
land
of
no
shadow
from
1933
and
a
squares
\x93flatland
from
1884
really
shaped
this
viewpoint
read
them
if
you
really
want
to
understand
what
i
mean]

coming
down

again
i
become
aware
of
the
turtle
tank
and
again
view
the
exact
same
image
of
hiram
diving
from
the
surface
30
degrees
right
to
eye
level
directly
in
front
of
me
i
feel
a
powerful
deja
vu
and
then
the
realization
that
this
must
be
a
shadow
of
the
\x93cycles
that
my
brother
franklin
experiences
while
on
dmt
i
know
that
my
eyes
are
open
because
i
am
seeing
hiram
but
investigation
reveals
that
sober
eyes
can
see
much
more
of
my
apartment
under
identical
lighting
conditions
i
can
only
conclude
that
the
dmt
caused
a
tunnel-vision
effect
lending
support
to
the
hypothesis
that
endogenous
[produced
in
the
body]
dmt
plays
a
role
in
near
death
experiences

at
this
point
the
image
of
hiram
was
overlaid
with
my
childhood
home
as
the
internal
music
swelled
to
another
dynamic
peak
i
could
see
both
places
at
the
same
time
but
only
for
a
split
second
in
that
moment
i
felt
as
though
i
was
looking
in
all
directions
at
once
in
front
of
me
was
the
turtle
tank/home
image
all
other
directions
left
right
behind
up
down
forward
in
time
backward
in
time
and
a
host
of
others
i
understood
then
but
not
anymore
appear
to
be
dark
and
sinister
but
not
frightening
tunnels
crafted
of
incomprehensible
red
and
gold
calculus
equations
stretching
into
infinity

my
vision
shifted
briefly
to
a
view
of
myself
and
the
turtle
tank
from
the
same
perspective
i
had
seen
my
child-hood
home
behind
and
above
my
body
i
\x93felt/saw/heard/tasted
myself
and
everything
else
in
my
apartment
as
it
fell
from
the
sky
and
into
its
proper
place
specifically
i
remember
watching
my
refrigerator
and
dishwasher
fall
from
a
great
height
gradually
changing
from
spinning
calculus
equations
to
mundane
appliances

the
walls
behind
the
turtle
tank
and
to
the
left
[which
a
sober
eye
can
see
in
perfect
detail]
become
apparent
to
me
for
the
first
time
since
i
dosed
as
greenish
[again
the
same
green
my
inner
eye
sees
when
i
push
on
my
closed
eyes]
suggestions
of
walls
i
am
beginning
to
realize
that
i
am
right
where
i
left
myself
but
am
not
really
aware
of
my
body
except
that
breathing
still
feels
great
i
watch
hiram
make
a
3rd
identical
dive
to
check
on
me
and
thank
him
for
watching
my
body

turning
my
head
for
the
first
time
since
i
dosed
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
certificate
i
have
mounted
on
my
wall
my
rational
mind
knows
that
it
is
just
a
piece
of
paper
which
gives
me
the
legal
right
to
perform
weddings
and
such
but
my
chemically
altered
mind
sees
a
presence
within
it
i
experienced
a
moment
of
greeting
and
farewell
\x93hello
im/were
so
glad
youre
here
and
you
found
me/us
and
arent
scared
this
time
we/i
were
right
here
the
whole
time
right
where
i/we
have
always
been
please
come
back
and
see
us/me
again
some
time
the
emotion
[and
i
use
the
word
\x93emotion
very
loosely]
i
feel
from
this
\x93entity
at
that
moment
is
similar
to
the
thrill
and
joy
i
felt
as
a
child
when
i
was
found
while
playing
hide-and-seek

returning
to
baseline

filling
my
lungs
continues
to
be
a
wonderful
sensation
it
reminds
me
that
i
survived
and
that
feels
great
i
am
close
enough
to
reality
now
that
i
can
see
my
apartment
again
the
colors
are
nearly
normal
except
for
the
suggestions
of
red
green
and
gold
calculus
equations
swimming
on
all
the
surfaces
i
can
concentrate
on
one
object
and
view
it
as
\x93normal
but
everything
else
swims
with
calculus
this
is
rather
enjoyable
and
i
groove
for
a
while
on
the
mild
visuals
that
are
somehow
more
real
than
lsd
or
mushroom
visuals
before
i
realize
something

i
was
back
home
but
hadnt
i
just
been
home
how
could
i
be
home
from
home
this
was
mildly
confusing
until
my
brain
put
it
together
this
way
the
next
day
\x93i
was
back
home
from
home
and
yet
i
had
never
physically
left
my
home

i
wandered
around
my
apartment
for
a
few
minutes
looking
at
things
touching
things
experiencing
the
real
world
again
everything
seemed
amazing
and
new
though
it
was
the
same
old
mess
i
left
less
than
half
an
hour
ago
eventually
i
was
seized
by
a
desire
to
write
and
grabbed
my
notebook
to
record
the
outline
that
would
eventually
become
this
experience
report
in
retrospect
i
probably
\x93wasted
a
good
portion
of
my
after-effects
by
attempting
to
document
too
soon
but
this
is
ok
because
i
felt
my
memory
of
the
early
experience
slipping
away

notes

i
have
tried
to
put
this
experience
into
some
sort
of
chronological
order
to
make
it
easy
to
read
in
reality
this
is
a
distortion
of
the
experience
as
i
had
no
sense
of
\x93time
as
it
was
going
on
in
fact
everything
from
the
end
of
the
\x93coming
up
section
to
the
end
of
the
\x93coming
down
section
should
be
considered
to
have
happened
all
at
the
same
time
it
is
only
through
several
weeks
of
thinking
and
analysis
of
the
\x93cycles
i
seemed
to
experience
that
i
was
able
to
approximate
a
timeline
for
this
truthfully
the
experience
was
not
nearly
so
linear
as
this
report
makes
it
out
to
be

even
though
i
survived
this
experience
without
lasting
damage
i
do
not
recommend
smoking
dmt
alone
my
brother
franklin
has
this
to
say
about
the
solo
dmt
experience
\x93i
worry
about
my
physical
body
too
much
to
do
dmt
without
somebody
watching
it
it
feels
as
though
my
body
pulls
my
awareness
back
from
hyperspace
to
check
on
it
if
i
know
it
is
alone
i
wholeheartedly
agree
with
this
sentiment
an
aquatic
reptile
is
not
a
responsible
substitute
for
a
human
guide

i
relived
this
experience
often
in
the
weeks
that
followed
looking
at
microorganisms
in
fresh
pond
water
under
a
microscope
nearly
caused
an
embarrassing
flashback
and
i
know
i
heard
the
music
many
times
in
the
end
it
took
me
nearly
a
week
to
shake
off
the
schizophrenic
feeling
of
existing
in
2
worlds
at
the
same
time

final
thoughts

for
me
dmt
is
incredibly
rough
coming
up
but
ridiculously
gentle
coming
down
imagine
what
an
ant
might
feel
if
taken
by
a
scientist
and
launched
into
the
sky
in
a
model
rocket
to
be
returned
safely
on
a
parachute
to
the
exact
point
where
she
left
her
ant-hill
her
world
and
all
her
reference
points
are
momentarily
destroyed
only
to
find
herself
in
the
same
place
half
an
hour
later
translate
this
into
psychedelic
terms
and
you
will
begin
to
understand
the
dmt
experience
as
i
experience
it

i
shift
between
past
and
present
tense
often
i
feel
like
it
shows
how
much
of
this
experience
is
direct
memory
present
tense
vs
memories
that
i
seemed
to
recallpast
tense
while
documenting
after
the
experience
i
find
it
an
interesting
literary
device
but
its
against
\x93the
rules
of
coherent
writing




several
years
ago
i
experimented
with
dmt
i
was
introduced
to
this
chemical
through
a
friend
of
mine
who
was
heavily
into
shamanism
over
a
12
month
period
i
smoked
it
4
times
with
ever
increasing
doses
my
friend
recommended
that
i
work
my
way
up
to
the
spirit
dose
this
was
wise
because
even
in
smaller
doses
it
can
be
a
frightening
experience
on
my
fifth
journey
i
found
them
-
or
more
accurately
they
found
me

ive
since
read
accounts
from
mckenna
and
strassmans
subjects
i
guess
my
experience
was
similar
though
i
didnt
perceive
myself
as
being
inside
a
structure
-
rather
it
seemed
that
the
spirits
were
all
around
me
wherever
i
looked
the
swirling
patterns
transmogrified
into
these
oscillating
things
which
clearly
acted
independently
of
my
own
thoughts
at
least
that
was
the
overwhelming
perception
i
had
i
cant
really
describe
them
-
they
were
infinite
in
their
complexity
i
can
see
why
people
are
convinced
that
they
are
entities
separate
from
their
own
minds
-
its
inconceivable
that
anyone
can
imagine
such

i
dont
what
youd
call
them
or
it

anyway
i
was
there
-
wherever
the
hell
it
was
-
and
all
of
a
sudden
each
one
of
my
fingers
was
connected
to
a
spirit
heres
where
it
gets
really
strange
-
there
were
thousands
of
them
near
me
now
and
millions
in
the
distance
-
though
if
i
looked
at
the
distant
ones
they
zoomed
up
close
so
next
thing
i
know
each
hand
has
thousands
of
fingers
i
had
complete
control
over
each
one
like
we
can
move
our
left
index
finger
i
could
control
left
finger
40624
it
was
like
i
was
a
conductor
-
they
were
dancing
and
flying
around
in
accordance
with
what
i
did
with
my
super-hands
sound
and
sight
seemed
to
merge
and
shift
-
i
was
conducting
an
orchestra
of
millions


there
was
a
lot
of
other
stuff
too
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
recall
it
my
final
memory
is
being
in
absolute
nothingness
except
for
one
spirit
as
i
looked
at
it
it
started
to
oscillate
so
as
i
was
looking
at
myself
-
or
what
i
perceived
was
myself
-
i
was
changing
form
a
thousand
times
a
second
the
oscillations
became
faster
-
and
the
spirit
wanted
to
know
who
it
was
it
wasnt
asked
in
words
but
i
knew
what
the
question
was
-
somehow
i
said
i
dont
know
this
conversation
went
back
and
forth
at
an
ever
greater
speed
until
at
the
same
time
we
were
both
saying
he
is
you
is
he
is
you
then
the
words
converged
into
hue
-
literally
it
was
blue
i
mean
i
became
the
colour
blue
a
psychedelic
play
on
words
i
was
a
frequency
then
this
spirit
rushed
up
to
me
from
the
other
side
of
the
galaxy
laughing
he
had
a
present
-
like
a
normal
box
with
a
blue
ribbon
and
he
said
whats
your
favourite
hue
next
thing
i
knew
id
opened
my
eyes
the
extra
freaky
element
was
that
i
had
turned
my
head
around
and
was
looking
straight
out
the
windowat
you
guessed
it
a
big
clear
blue
sky


once
i
had
met
them
or
myself
perhaps
-
i
certainly
dont
ascribe
to
the
literal
idea
that
dmt
is
conducive
to
contacting
aliens
i
decided
not
to
do
dmt
again
i
have
experienced
total
and
absolute
fuckn
out
there
-
and
id
be
scared
that
if
i
did
it
again
that
i
wouldnt
make
it
back
i
dont
think
that
there
could
be
a
more
intense
experience
however
i
never
imagined
id
experience
what
i
did
either
its
amazing
-
but
a
word
of
caution
it
isnt
a
fun
party
drug
some
people
want
to
go
skydiving
and
thats
cool
but
this
was
like
being
a
super-ball
bouncing
around
the
universe
at
the
time
it
really
was
too
much

the
final
freakiness
at
certain
times
of
the
morning
or
afternoon
i
look
at
the
sky
and
get
this
deja-vu
feeling
its
just
the
right
shade
of
blue




a
composite
essay
of
my
first
two
dmt
trips

disclaimer
this
is
a
pale
reflection
of
a
bottomless
mystery
the
things
i
say
it
is
it
is
now
-
these
are
but
linguistic
shrouds
i
am
able
to
cloak
it
in
please
dont
think
you
know
dmt
from
having
read
this
you
dont
but
do
please
consider
trying
some
go
extract
it
from
a
plant
-
then
you
will
know
everything
here
is
with
closed
eyes
unless
otherwise
indicated
-
this
is
really
the
only
way
to
go
deep

the
small
wooden
pipe
was
in
my
mouth
and
a
match
was
coming
to
light
it
the
scenario
almost
seemed
like
smoking
pot
except
i
knew
the
taste
to
be
very
wrong
as
the
complex
sweetly
acrid
smoke
filled
my
lungs
anyway
my
pulse
never
raced
like
this
from
the
anticipation
of
getting
stoned

the
first
thing
was
a
sense
of
dropping
away
but
to
say
downward
would
be
too
simple
there
were
all
sorts
of
frequency
modulations
and
crescendoed
stacatto
pops
as
the
trip
descended
this
sound
data
was
quiveringly
involved
with
these
visual
architectonic
dream
waters
that
were
beginning
to
emerge
dripping
and
slipping
amongst
themselves
and
my
being
became
overwhelmed
by
vacuous
gravity-like
suction
experiences
which
impelled
me
further
in
around
me
i
felt
a
crowding
in
of
beings
as
if
the
celtic
faerie
land
of
fay
had
become
momentarily
co-present
with
where
i
was
i
sensed
them
but
did
not
experience
these
creatures
the
sucking
experience
took
over
for
a
while
then
driving
the
morphological
acrobatics
of
spacelove
that
lay
before
me
there
was
something
about
it
that
makes
me
think
of
a
voluptuous
alien
seductress
with
big
fat
lips
pulling
me
to
her
body
in
the
weirdest
feeling
embrace
ever
it
felt
like
i
was
being
smeared
sensually
and
lustfully
around
the
space
in
some
sort
of
vacuum-tube
funhouse
at
this
point
maybe
a
minute
into
the
experience
i
started
picking
up
something
like
the
escher
painting
of
all
those
sets
of
stairs
with
figures
descending
by
all
manners
of
gravity
only
its
surfaces
were
emerald
isles
of
what
i
can
only
describe
as
fractal
medusa
liquid
serpentine
and
sexy
there
was
a
thought
that
i
was
in
a
room
full
of
aliens
and
they
were
playing
with
me
but
that
somehow
they
had
conspired
to
make
me
this
way
-
the
alien
carney
music
bar
on
the
planet
tatooine
in
the
star
wars
trilogy
seems
relevant

then
i
had
the
thought
which
just
seems
to
pop
up
and
not
really
pertain
what
have
i
done
how
did
i
get
this
way
meaning
how
did
i
come
to
enter
something
so
foreign
that
my
petty
human
ontological
premises
and
hopeful
body
of
knowledge
seem
like
a
wrench
trying
to
adjust
a
camel
at
that
point
i
lost
any
touch
with
my
body
and
was
thrust
forward
into
complete
and
utter
amazement
the
world
became
so
crammed
full
of
intricacy
to
the
nth
that
it
seemed
every
nook
and
cranny
in
my
spacetime
was
exfoliating
little
crystalline
dancing
worlds
bellowing
ecstasy
it
moved
like
snakes
move
all
rippling
of
muscle
and
sun
glinting
scales
i
cannot
emphasize
enough
the
catapulting
titanic
motions
of
this
iridescent
zigzag
bottlerocket
this
nuanced
whittling
circus
of
form
this
brobignagian
roller
coaster
safari
across
the
jeweled
plains
of
wonderland
straining
the
limits
of
the
knowable

this
is
where
i
was
when
i
felt
a
certain
sort
of
shockwave
across
the
dome
of
the
sky
which
gave
me
memory
of
the
real
world
i
then
entered
this
whole
journey
that
i
would
call
extrication
going
in
was
intrication
or
delving
into
intricacy
so
coming
back
out
was
sensibly
extrication
the
experience
was
very
literally
an
incedible
groping
back
out
of
this
wild
wooly
thing
until
i
made
it
out
which
afterwards
i
realized
was
only
the
physical
action
of
opening
my
eyes
the
pipe
was
in
my
mouth
-
its
touching
my
lips
had
been
the
reality
shockwave
id
felt
the
woman
who
was
handling
the
pipe
for
me
looked
like
a
fractal
medusa
as
well
but
incarnate
-
she
was
buzzing
all
over
with
this
really
freaky
energy
i
said
something
like
you
expect
me
to
call
this
a
mouth
a
comment
which
was
silenced
by
the
stem
of
the
pipe
one
toke
and
i
was
out
of
my
body
again
yanked
back
through
the
scrim
of
the
worlds
into
the
blast
furnaces
of
heaven

i
came
to
in
some
sense
at
this
point
and
realized
that
i
could
do
anything
in
a
space
like
this
could
instantly
unfold
my
richest
possible
imaginings
ok
i
said
to
myself
what
about
trying
to
do
what
you
believe
possible
by
your
perceptual
theory
of
higher
dimensional
experience
you
see
i
got
the
idea
that
there
is
no
reason
why
in
an
inner
experience
one
has
to
have
visions
only
in
front
of
one
i
began
to
believe
this
was
an
imprint
that
years
of
bringing
the
external
world
into
construction
of
inner
spaces
had
created
but
was
not
necessary
i
then
tried
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
see
in
every
direction
at
once
ie
what
would
a
ball
look
like
if
you
could
see
every
side
of
it
at
once
i
could
sense
it
but
not
imagine
it
in
my
mind
so
this
is
the
challenge
i
set
myself
it
not
only
seemed
to
work
though
with
everything
else
going
on
inside
it
was
a
bit
like
trying
to
do
a
sensitive
physics
experiment
in
the
midst
of
a
drunken
bacchanal
but
it
did
so
immediately
i
rushed
upwards
into
this
superspace
that
was
a
spun
galactic
ecology
of
stars
a
swarming
hive
of
dragonfly
constellations



this
was
very
profound
but
in
doing
it
it
seemed
i
had
reduced
the
alien
quality
of
what
had
been
going
on
previous
to
this
excursion

i
let
my
will
go
then
and
tumbled
forward
into
elfland
terence
mckenna
is
apt
in
calling
these
entities
elves
they
are
elves/not-elves
they
dont
appear
they
kind
of
ooze
out
of
the
woodwork
seductively
and
before
you
know
it
theyre
there
-
the
whole
realm
is
infested
with
these
creatures
like
nothing
else
you
could
ever
imagine
they
do
sing
things
that
are
like
self-dribbling
jeweled
basketballs
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
they
make
faberge
egg
concoctions
with
ingredient
lists
like
1
space
2
lust
3
politics
4
circus
sideshows
5
time
6
gall
bladders
7
existential
notions
of
polyfidelity
8
cucumbers
9
beethovens
5th
symphony
10
the
smell
of
petunias
and
so
on
this
is
somewhat
of
an
arbitrary
list
but
the
point
is
all
my
categories
of
mind
fell
away
because
they
were
being
ceaselessly
synthesized
and
re-synthesized
into
these
hyperdimensional
objects
undulating
ululating
along
it
makes
me
think
of
getting
home
from
school
when
your
mother
says
that
shes
baked
you
some
treats
only
these
are
like
no
treats
mom
ever
made
and
when
you
see
them
you
almost
want
to
say
aw
mom
you
shouldnt
have
i
mean
you
really
shouldnt
have
what
you
do
with
these
elves
is
some
sort
of
a
game
of
catch
only
the
physics
of
the
game
has
been
replaced
by
the
physics
of
synesthesia
in
catching
the
things
they
threw
in
playing
with
them
i
participated
in
the
ineffable
mysteries
that
they
were
this
place
is
the
joycean
merry
go
raum
being
there
i
came
to
understand
the
heraclitus
fragment
the
aeon
is
a
child
at
play
with
colored
balls
it
is
this
as
well
i
understand
still
the
first
day
all
fools
day
here
at
the
center
it
is
this
too

so
for
what
seemed
like
centuries
i
played
with
the
trippy
freaky
elves
and
they
kept
bringing
me
into
atrium
after
atrium
in
the
antics
annex
and
all
i
could
do
was
wonder
when
we
would
get
to
their
front
door
as
far
as
i
know
we
never
did
instead
they
said
many
things
though
i
cant
say
they
used
what
we
would
call
a
voice
to
accomplish
this
communication
i
remember
only
parts
of
this
at
first
they
said
build
this
indicating
hyperspace
later
they
amended
this
by
saying
build
it
he
will
come
from
the
movie
field
of
dreams
very
funny

then
it
was
as
though
alarms
started
to
go
off
and
the
whole
space
was
going
through
these
quivering
emergency
elaborations
i
get
the
image
of
a
submarine
movie
sequence
when
i
think
back
on
this
just
when
it
has
been
discovered
on
the
surface
the
periscope
retracts
and
the
whole
interior
goes
into
haywire
preparatory
gymnastics
as
all
the
hatches
are
battened
down
there
is
a
phenomenally
high-energy
dynamic
associated
with
this
part
as
they
try
to
get
you
out
and
shut
the
great
bronze
dancing
doors
of
hyperspace
it
is
as
if
everything
is
charged
with
imponderable
electricities
and
is
racing
around
because
someone
shouted
places
everyone
they
start
cramming
your
soul
out
of
there
with
a
million
hands
at
once
grabbing
you
by
twelve
dimensions
you
never
knew
your
body
had
finally
the
thing
shuts
and
there
is
a
sense
of
finality
to
that
but
just
as
soon
you
are
on
to
the
next
thing

slowly
then
it
begins
to
make
farewells
and
say
its
goodbyes
ancient
mythos
holds
that
the
world
is
supported
by
turtles
all
the
way
down
but
as
i
came
out
of
it
my
sense
was
of
jeweled
great
glass
revolving
elevators
all
the
way
down
i
remember
thinking
that
i
was
passing
back
through
the
50000
veils
that
the
sufis
say
the
mystery
has
one
by
one
and
i
clearly
remember
the
awe
i
felt
that
each
one
of
them
was
closed
sealed
and
put
away
in
a
unique
and
voluptuous
succulent
way
it
was
without
question
the
most
beautiful
goodbye
i
have
known
in
this
life
there
was
no
regret
of
leaving
or
longing
not
to
leave
just
an
overpowering
acceptance
of
the
imminent
return
this
went
on
and
upon
opening
my
eyes
i
had
this
very
zap
experience
and
i
was
right
back
in
this
world
amazingly
enough
only
ten
minutes
gone
slight
tracers
on
light
and
then
these
gone
too
i
was
amazed
of
the
idea
that
one
could
go
back
there
could
in
fact
just
go
there
that
where
i
had
been
felt
entirely
like
it
was
a
whole
hyperspace
raging
right
next
door
i
remember
saying
and
being
very
sure
of
this
as
i
still
am
now
those
are
the
gods
by
which
i
meant
of
all
the
things
ive
experienced
in
life
they
are
the
most
like
real
living
gods
and
should
be
called
that
it
was
very
interesting
to
me
that
i
didnt
need
to
process
a
whole
lot
which
i
usually
require
after
the
mushrooms
instead
i
think
i
was
in
a
state
of
being
so
existentially
surpassed
by
the
quality
of
what
i
had
just
been
a
part
of
that
i
couldnt
muster
any
sort
of
conceptual
or
descriptive
response
to
it
at
all
by
default
i
was
left
with
just
a
purity
of
acceptance
for
it
-
i
just
simply
had
nothing
to
put
to
it
in
any
sense
instead
i
resorted
to
looking
wildly
and
deeply
into
other
peoples
eyes
and
by
some
existential-perceptual
force
to
impress
upon
them
the
utter
beauty
of
what
i
had
just
been
this
seemed
to
work
somewhat
though
probably
not
i
definitely
felt
i
had
been
closer
to
the
core
of
the
real
than
ever
before
and
that
this
mystery
is
front
and
center
to
who
we
are
as
humans
who
we
really
are
i
felt
very
connected
to
my
universe
very
sensitive
and
strong
and
in
touch
with
things
because
i
apparently
have
the
gift
of
being
able
to
remember
it
quite
well
others
do
not
i
have
to
live
with
memory
of
its
being
out
there
somewhere
very
real
very
powerful
very
alive
there
has
not
been
an
hour
to
pass
since
i
did
it
that
i
havent
thought
of
it
and
tried
again
to
reference
it
to
this
world
failing
i
do
feel
it
is
a
very
important
experience
to
have
as
a
human
being
and
in
some
sense
a
whole
lot
safer
than
mushrooms
or
acid
i
say
this
because
i
am
aware
that
i
usually
have
time
and
opportunity
in
a
traditional
trip
to
come
up
with
weird
ideas
and
believe
them
which
can
be
hell
to
integrate
when
things
return
to
normal
dmt
seems
to
be
so
awe-inspiring
one
is
just
so
floored
by
it
that
there
is
no
chance
for
trying
to
figure
it
out

this
is
left
for
when
you
return
spacecraft
still
steaming




drifting
deeply
into
the
visual
ebb
and
flow
of
the
dmt
i
just
walked
through
the
thin
fabric
of
the
visual
fractal
fantasy
it
was
like
a
gauze
layer
of
the
dream
just
separated
and
boom

it
was
like
walking
from
a
dark
night
into
a
brightly
lit
casino
in
las
vegas
i
felt
like
i
had
walked
behind
the
scenes
into
a
series
of
rooms
everything
was
prime
color
cranked
up
to
it
s
fullest
potential
the
images
were
clear
crisp
and
vivid
many
times
more
vivid
then
the
early
pre-room
images

there
were
two
people
a
man
and
a
women
or
a
girl
and
a
boy
they
appeared
to
me
like
simple
balloon
computer
generated
images
as
soon
as
i
stepped
in
the
room
they
glided
up
to
me
and
spoke
directly
to
me
they
kept
saying
welcome
back
and
words
like
the
big
winner
he
has
returned
welcome
to
the
end
and
the
beginning
you
are
the
one
as
i
looked
around
the
room
i
felt
the
sense
of
some
huge
celebration
upon
my
entry
to
this
place
bells
were
ringing
lights
flashing
fear
began
to
rise
in
me
as
i
felt
the
deep
change
in
my
world
the
sprites
begin
to
lead
me
around
the
room
showing
me
how
all
my
life
they
had
been
preparing
me
for
this
return
i
was
shown
dozen
of
experiences
simultaneously
in
my
life
that
had
lead
up
to
and
been
clues
to
this
moment
i
was
shown
in
a
flood
and
a
onslaught
of
images
thoughts
situations
raw
feelings
that
everything
had
been
building
to
this
moment
that
this
moment
had
been
planned

they
told
me
it
was
a
gift
that
i
had
been
selected
to
be
the
one
i
felt
feelings
of
huge
relief
excitement
and
fear
in
the
sprites
at
this
moment
in
the
experience
i
became
afraid
for
my
life
i
felt
that
this
gift
would
cost
me
my
life
i
did
not
want
to
be
the
one
the
sprits
felt
this
fear
in
me
and
begin
to
hold
my
hands
and
arms
rushing
me
deeper
into
their
world
i
felt
their
fear
and
i
begin
to
believe
that
i
had
stepped
out
of
the
dream
out
of
the
drug
out
of
my
body
and
mind
and
into
this
super
world
i
begin
to
believe
in
the
transformation
as
i
walked
deeper
i
could
see
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
the
center
of
this
place
an
object
similar
to
an
hour
glass
it
was
slowly
turning
over
i
became
aware
that
this
vessel
as
it
tipped
over
transferring
its
contents
from
the
small
red
end
to
the
larger
blue
end
was
transforming
me
i
felt
my
humanity
slip
out
as
i
was
filled
with
this
new
powerful
light
a
light
of
greater
perception
of
clarity
it
felt
like
returning
home
it
felt
familiar
it
felt
like
i
was
waking
up
from
a
hollow
pale
dream
of
reality
i
felt
god
like
and
omnipotent
i
realized
the
this
gift
was
not
only
a
gift
but
equally
a
death
sentence
for
my
physical
body
i
felt
like
i
had
been
chosen
to
receive
this
not
out
of
benevolence
but
out
of
a
need
to
release
this
power
and
perception
there
had
to
be
the
one
to
relieve
the
others
there
had
to
be
the
one
who
perceived
completely
i
felt
like
christ
at
the
moment
of
realization
of
godhood
and
the
inevitable
moment
of
his
crucifixion
i
also
felt
like
all
this
knowledge
and
perception
was
far
too
large
to
be
processed
by
my
physical
mind
and
that
death
was
the
obvious
transition

as
this
moment
of
realization
hit
me
i
felt
the
sprites
smile
and
step
back
they
told
me
i
was
the
one
and
this
was
real
and
that
it
would
never
end

they
said
do
you
not
believe
then
see


at
this
moment
i
sat
up
in
the
real
world
and
opened
my
eyes
this
moment
true
panic
set
in
i
was
deeply
hallucinating
the
real
world
was
being
covered
transformed
into
a
psychedelic
kaleidoscope
of
energy
every
surface
had
something
like
movie
film
one
image
after
another
lined
up
like
film
shown
through
an
overhead
projector
these
were
the
prime
images
of
our
symbolic
nature
slowly
rolling
over
every
surface
like
the
sprites
of
the
objects
i
felt
i
was
seeing
time
in
a
singularity
i
felt
like
i
was
seeing
the
symbolic
patters
like
a
second
perception
of
true
meaning
in
the
real
room
there
were
two
people
sitting
next
to
me
when
i
looked
at
them
i
felt
reassured
momentarily
then
they
exploded
into
dozens
of
two
dimensional
layers
of
light
looking
like
computer
generated
futurists
paintings
wafer
thin
halos
created
the
shapes
of
my
friends
dave
looked
up
at
me
and
said
welcome
back
causing
me
to
panic
because
when
he
said
welcome
back
i
did
not
think
it
was
back
to
reality
but
back
into
the
fold
of
this
super
world
i
was
in
back
as
there
chosen
one
or
at
least
one
amongst
them
i
perceived
dave
and
poon
as
personal
guides
or
guardians
or
gatekeepers
there
to
welcome
me
into
this
new
exalted
state
that
moment
striped
me
of
my
world
my
truths
leading
me
to
believe
that
my
hallucinations
were
truth
i
once
again
had
the
crashing
feeling
of
winning
of
being
chosen
and
being
forced
to
receive
this
unwanted
sentence
of
total
vision
i
had
this
crash
as
i
could
see
once
again
the
cause
and
effect
of
my
being
there
and
the
price
i
would
have
to
pay
i
was
the
bean
king
and
the
price
of
my
gift
would
be
perceptual
transcendence
but
physical
death

at
this
time
i
felt
a
collapsing
feeling
as
i
gave
in
to
the
experience
excepting
my
fate
i
remember
thinking
that
the
hour
glass
had
turned
a
little
farther
and
i
was
pouring
out
of
this
life
into
my
new
one
i
said
out
loud
i
am
dying
then
i
lost
the
support
of
my
body
my
self
my
existence
and
i
began
to
drift

dave
then
touched
my
leg
i
remember
being
drawn
back
into
my
body
and
thinking
to
hell
with
this
i
am
not
going
to
die
not
yet
and
i
felt
the
sprites
smiling
around
me
looking
at
me
i
felt
the
fear
i
felt
the
exhilaration
of
my
visions
i
was
back
in
the
sprites
room
even
though
this
place
was
vibrant
and
psychedelic
it
was
within
my
ability
to
comprehend
the
sprits
began
there
pitch
at
me
being
a
winner
and
the
one
i
felt
they
were
taking
me
back
down
the
hallway
to
open
those
iconic
electric
vision
and
to
my
death
i
then
said
out
loud
again
i
am
dying
to
which
dave
responded
only
three
more
minutes
and
you
will
be
all
right

three
more
minutes
three
more
minutes
was
like
a
life
raft
that
i
sailed
out
of
that
world
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
believe
that
in
three
more
minutes
i
would
be
normal
again
and
everything
began
to
fade
i
felt
in
control
of
my
body
and
my
life
slowly
i
drifted
out
of
the
their
world
back
through
the
gauzy
world
of
colors
and
patterns
with
a
little
extra
coaxing
from
my
friends
i
was
able
to
wake
up
and
separate
my
self
from
that
moment

i
still
vibrate
from
the
experience

i
am
very
grateful
to
have
been
with
my
friends




following
a
few
hours
of
screening
and
getting
acquainted
with
the
mri
i
had
two
full
dmt
study
days
at
the
imperial
colleges
hammersmith
hospital
in
london
as
a
participant
in
some
cutting
edge
brain
imaging
neuroscience
research
conducted
by
researchers
at
imperial
college
london
the
two
study
days
were
a
week
apart
a
slot
came
available
earlier
than
originally
planned
and
it
was
a
big
help
to
the
imperial
guys
with
my
being
able
to
be
flexible
i
abstained
from
intoxicants
a
week
prior
to
the
study
day
i
was
initially
invited
to
participate
in
the
pilot
dmt-eeg
study
via
a
friend
who
is
paying
for
the
mri
scanning
sessions
and
i
had
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
this
study
due
to
other
study
participants
moving
about
in
the
scanner
and
giving
poor
quality
data
as
a
result

on
the
study
day
on
arrival
at
the
hospital
i
meet
with
the
head
neuroscientist
whose
study
it
is
another
researcher
working
with
him
and
the
medical
doctor
who
will
be
injecting
me
with
the
dmt
high
purity
synthetic
dmt
fumarate
and
placebo
saline
i
wash
my
hair
in
preparation
for
the
eeg
skullcap
being
fitted
while
completing
a
number
of
questionnaire
surveys
on
a
laptop
electrodes
are
attached
to
a
number
of
places
over
my
scalp
via
a
gel
that
soon
solidifies
im
wired
up
to
the
eeg
and
shown
how
sensitive
it
is
to
noisy
data
essentially
if
the
face
isnt
relaxed
so
one
needs
to
be
relaxed
and
very
still
while
undergoing
the
dmt
experience
in
the
mri
for
high
quality
data
to
be
produced
im
fitted
with
an
injection
port
in
my
arm
to
allow
for
easy
iv
injection
of
dmt
and
placebo
i
have
good
rapport
with
the
imperial
team
and
feel
like
im
in
good
safe
hands
ive
met
the
leading
neuroscientist
running
the
study
a
number
of
times
hes
a
great
chap

there
are
four
eeg
and
fmri
brain
scanning
sessionstwo
with
dmt
in
the
medium
and
high
dosage
range
two
with
saline
placebo
and
i
dont
know
which
order
ill
be
receiving
the
dosages
in
it
was
good
to
have
been
acquainted
with
the
mri
environment
prior
to
any
dosing
my
upper
body
is
confined
to
the
mri
tube
and
my
head
is
secured
for
the
quality
of
both
the
eeg
and
mri
data
it
is
imperative
i
cannot
and
do
not
move
i
have
eye
shades
on
while
being
scanned
with
eyes
closed
the
scanner
is
really
quite
noisy
but
despite
the
noise
and
the
confined
restricted
space
i
quite
quickly
start
to
feel
comfortable
in
there

i
was
really
quite
nervous
prior
to
my
first
dosing
prior
to
my
first
scanning
session
i
gave
a
urine
sample
for
a
drug
test
to
make
sure
i
was
clean
i
was
fitted
into
the
bed
in
the
scanner
and
it
was
made
sure
i
was
secure
my
head
was
locked
in
and
i
was
fitted
with
ear
plugs
and
ear
defenders
eye
shades
were
placed
over
my
eyes
and
i
was
loaded
into
the
scanner
anxiety
levels
were
increasing
i
communicate
with
the
study
lead
through
an
intercom
he
plays
a
recording
of
you
are
receiving
the
dose
now
and
i
select
my
preferred
volume
over
the
sound
of
the
baseline
scan
of
my
brain
following
the
scan
it
is
time
for
the
dosing
i
know
that
dosing
is
now
imminent
and
i\m
pretty
nervous
and
my
heart
is
pounding
i
receive
my
dose
and
nothing
happens
going
on
from
previous
experience
in
the
dmt-eeg
pilot
study
i
know
it
would
only
be
a
few
seconds
before
i
start
feeling
the
dose
if
it
was
dmt
i\m
able
to
relax
knowing
i
will
not
be
receiving
the
dose
now
i
think
this
worked
quite
well
as
with
more
time
spent
in
the
mri
scanner
the
more
comfortable
i
got
being
in
there

i
fill
out
a
variety
of
questionnaire
surveys
and
we
have
lunch
another
member
of
the
imperial
team
i
know
comes
to
pay
me
a
visit
with
his
baby
this
is
nice
and
has
a
soothing
effect
on
my
nerves
we
head
back
in
the
scanner
a
little
nervous
as
i
know
i
will
be
being
dosed
for
sure
now
i
personally
don\t
enter
the
dmt
space
lightly
these
daysit
is
not
really
a
love
n\
light
experience
for
me

i
personally
don\t
enter
the
dmt
space
lightly
these
daysit
is
not
really
a
love
n\
light
experience
for
me

but
rather
something
much
more
serious
and
imposing
in
tone
if
not
outright
menacing
in
tone
im
wired
up
and
loaded
in
the
scanner
with
a
panic
button
on
hand
and
im
talked
through
a
body
scanning
session
to
help
relax
me
this
time
around
i
will
provide
an
intensity
rating
every
minute
the
study
lead
starts
asking
me
my
intensity
rating
0
being
no
effect
10
being
the
most
intense
drug
effect
imaginable
so
i
know
dosing
is
imminent
i
hear
the
dosing
notification
recording
and
prepare
for
blast
off
within
in
a
few
seconds
there
is
a
distinct
shift
and
expansion
of
perception
behind
closed
eyelidsthe
contrast
changes
dramatically
a
silvery
screen
comes
into
focus
and
from
this
geometric
patterns
of
extraordinary
beauty
and
order
condense
and
coalesce
and
link
up
in
the
space
of
just
a
few
seconds
at
the
same
time
i
become
aware
of
this
feeling
of
heat
or
warm
energy
in
both
of
my
hands
something
i
experience
repeatedly
on
mushrooms
and
other
psychedelics
and
cannabis
and
sometimes
while
deeply
relaxed
or
meditating
this
is
a
pleasant
sensation
and
for
some
reason
it
reassured
me
i
knew
i
was
going
to
be
ok
and
relaxed
and
surrendered
completely
to
the
experience


it
takes
me
a
minute
following
dosing
to
peak
interestingly
at
minute
1
im
at
a
7
minute
2
im
at
an
8
by
minute
3
im
already
on
my
way
back
a
very
fleeting
and
fast
moving
experience
the
geometric
visual
architecture
im
witness
too
is
outrageously
beautiful
i
remember
coppery
bronzey
metallic
colours
navy
blue
and
some
neon
pink
in
the
centre
of
my
vision
during
the
peakin
the
centre
of
my
vision
it
was
like
there
was
a
light
shining
into
the
visual
realm
illuminating
what
i
was
seeing
and
splitting
up
the
spectrum
of
colours
to
produce
a
resplendently
coloured
but
localised
pool
of
constantly
undulating
colours
as
the
intensity
of
the
peak
wears
off
and
i
start
to
come
back
i
feel
in
a
serene
afterglow
state
and
i
nearly
tear
up
in
gratitude
for
having
the
opportunity
to
experience
something
so
amazing
i
completely
relaxed
into
the
remainder
of
the
experience
and
i
realise
the
anxieties
id
carried
were
misplaced


i
should
mention
that
iv
dmt
is
a
very
smooth
roa
and
i
much
prefer
it
to
vaping
the
transition
to
dmt
space
i
found
was
smoother
and
less
jarring
than
vaping
it
and
due
to
this
smooth
entry
to
dmt
space
it
seems
to
change
the
tone
of
the
experience
i
imagine
at
higher
dosages
things
are
likely
to
be
more
jarring
given
how
efficient
this
roa
is
and
im
not
really
condoning
it
as
i
was
injected
with
medical
grade
dmt
by
a
medical
doctor
it
was
a
nice
way
to
fly
though

following
the
experience
i
am
interviewed
in
detail
about
the
content
of
my
experience
and
find
i
can
recall
a
fair
bit
certainly
a
lot
more
than
by
subsequent
high
dose
experience
i
then
complete
a
number
of
questionnaire
surveys
to
assess
my
experience
in
different
ways
before
having
a
shower
to
wash
the
eeg
gel
out
of
my
scalp
remnants
of
which
remained
in
there
for
a
week
i
say
goodbye
to
the
study
lead
and
head
home

for
the
second
study
day
things
were
reversed
in
that
i
got
the
dmt
dose
in
the
morning
mri
scanning
session
and
the
placebo
for
the
intensity
rating
study
for
the
afternoon
placebo
session
even
without
being
dosed
i
was
definitely
in
an
altered
pre-hypnogogic
state
in
the
scanner
it
makes
me
curious
as
to
whether
the
very
powerful
magnets
of
the
mri
could
affect
the
brain
in
some
waybut
i
see
pink
light
pulsing
in
waves
and
my
imagination
and
memory
recall
is
unusually
vivid
i
feel
deeply
relaxed
in
there
despite
it
being
confined
and
it
being
so
noisy
and
i
feel
on
the
verge
of
sleep
following
this
i
am
interviewed
and
complete
more
questionnaire
surveys


my
second
dmt
dose
for
the
morning
scanning
session
was
a
fair
bit
higher
and
i
could
tell
this
within
a
few
seconds
of
being
injected
with
it
there
was
a
dramatic
change
in
contrast
accompanied
by
a
very
powerful
feeling
of
acceleration
or
expansion

there
was
a
dramatic
change
in
contrast
accompanied
by
a
very
powerful
feeling
of
acceleration
or
expansion

as
i
entered
the
dmt
space
i
encounter
similar
very
beautiful
very
ordered
geometric
visual
patterning
but
this
time
much
more
expansive
and
all
encompassing
and
much
fast
moving
i
recall
this
experience
being
one
of
supreme
order
and
supreme
chaostwo
oppositesat
the
same
time
this
was
a
more
imposing
experience
given
its
intensity
compared
to
the
first
lighter
dose
i
have
to
say
i
rather
enjoyed
the
mri
scanner
setting
despite
being
cramped
and
restricted
in
movement
despite
the
incredible
noise
it
was
experienced
as
a
positive
setting
for
a
dmt
experience
in
my
case
and
really
didnt
detract
one
of
my
friends
who
took
part
in
this
same
study
thought
the
same
the
interaction
of
the
loud
and
highly
repetitive
and
rhythmic
mri
scanner
sounds
was
interesting
and
had
a
big
effect
on
the
visual
aspect
of
the
experiencewhat
i
was
hearing
really
seemed
to
cross
over
with
what
i
was
seeing
and
at
the
peak
it
was
hard
to
know
which
was
which
the
experience
was
longer
than
the
previous
one
but
a
fair
bit
harder
to
recall
afterwards
on
my
re-entry
i
experienced
the
same
feelings
of
gratitude
and
feelings
of
love
and
empathy
for
the
special
people
in
my
life
despite
the
power
and
speed
of
the
geometries
i
was
moving
through
i
never
forgot
that
i
was
part
of
a
scientific
study
apparently
some
other
participants
did
forget
this
and
i
remained
absolutely
still
for
the
duration
i
was
commended
for
this
by
the
researchers
who
stated
that
i
would
be
in
the
front
of
the
queue
should
imperial
conduct
brain
imaging
research
with
5-meo-dmt



one
of
the
final
questions
i
was
asked
in
the
surveys
was
to
rate
to
what
degree
i
thought
the
experience
could
be
explained
as
the
effect
of
a
drug
on
the
brain
and
to
what
degree
i
thought
i
was
interacting
and
experiencing
something
outside
or
beyond
myself
during
the
experience
itself
i
may
have
been
more
inclined
towards
the
latter
but
once
i
was
back
i
rated
more
highly
on
the
drug
effect
on
brain
scalewhile
actually
being
in
the
dmt
space
can
be
so
real
so
vivid
and
so
convincing
at
times
when
i\m
back
down
and
my
mind
folds
back
in
on
itself
to
conform
to
this
reality
my
sceptical
walls
go
back
up
with
it
from
this
sober
vantage
point
it
seems
more
likely
to
me
that
the
dmt
experience
is
some
very
beautiful
and
mysterious
aberration
of
brain
functionnot
that
i
feel
that
detracts
from
its
majesty
really
given
how
mysterious
and
complex
and
amazing
human
brains
are

so
there
you
have
it
an
experience
i
feel
tremendous
gratitude
for
having
had
the
opportunity
to
have
and
great
to
see
scientific
research
on
psychedelics
start
to
expand
into
interesting
new
areas
and
great
also
to
encounter
some
really
great
people
involved
in
this
not
something
i
shall
ever
forget
onwards





i
should
start
off
by
saying
that
i
did
not
emotionally
or
mentally
prepare
for
this
trip
in
anyway
this
was
my
first
time
using
dmt
and
changa
and
i
didnt
want
to
spoil
the
experience
with
expectations
or
at
least
thats
what
i
told
myself
more
than
likely
i
was
just
lazy
i
had
read
a
few
dmt
experience
reports
in
the
past
so
i
broadly
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
but
it
had
been
over
6
months
since
i
read
any
of
those
reports
and
the
details
were
hazy
at
best
after
having
carried
the
substances
around
with
me
for
years
i
casually
decided
now
was
the
perfect
time
to
try
them


while
i
drastically
prefer
dissociatives
im
no
stranger
to
tryptamines
or
phenethylamines
with
these
classes
of
drugs
most
of
my
experience
stems
from
a
myriad
of
research
chemicals
i
have
never
done
mushrooms
and
have
only
tripped
on
lsd
a
couple
of
times
i
personally
find
it
very
difficult
to
let
go
while
on
psychedelics
with
the
exception
of
dissociatives
thus
my
strong
affinity
towards
them
nevertheless
on
a
beautiful
sunday
afternoon
i
decided
dmt
was
right
for
me

my
partner
anatoli
smorin
and
i
built
a
the
machine
to
smoke
the
crystal
dmt
while
the
changa
was
loaded
into
a
simple
glass
bowl
the
changa
was
sourced
from
an
individual
who
had
recently
returned
from
south
america
it
was
reported
to
consist
of
banisteriopsis
caapi
and
nn-dmt
i
took
the
vendor
for
their
word
and
did
not
have
a
third
party
test
the
substance
the
setting
for
this
is
a
beautiful
20acre
property
tucked
up
against
my
favorite
mountain
range
in
a
town
i
call
home
i
relaxed
against
an
apple
tree
in
the
orchard
and
began
my
experience



t
0000
i
pack
138
mg
of
changa
in
the
bowl
and
light
it
with
a
normal
bic
lighter
i
take
one
deep
inhale
and
attempt
to
hold
my
breath
as
someone
who
no
longer
smokes
weed
i
find
the
physical
act
of
smoking
to
be
quite
painful
my
lungs
burn
and
i
cough
everything
out
anatoli
laughs
at
me
and
encourages
me
to
take
another
hit


t
0003
i
inhale
again
this
time
trying
to
hold
my
breath
for
as
long
as
possible
smoking
is
painful
and
stupid
and
i
dont
enjoy
any
of
it
but
this
time
i
manage
to
keep
it
in
for
a
little
bit
longer
instantly
i
find
my
field
of
vision
changing
i
see
the
wind
gently
tangling
with
the
leaves
leaving
pastel
trails
in
its
wake
the
visuals
are
soft
and
gentle
a
wind
chime
sings
in
the
distance
how
nice
it
would
be
to
stay
here
forever

t
0005
37
mg
of
dmt
has
been
melted
into
the
the
machine
anatoli
holds
one
end
while
i
grab
onto
the
plastic
tubing
that
we
have
installed
as
a
mouthpiece
to
allow
anatoli
to
vaporize
the
material
while
i
focus
on
inhaling
am
i
really
about
to
smoke
dmt
all
of
the
sudden
i
find
this
to
be
quite
an
extreme
sunday
activity
clearly
i
am
not
a
church
going
individual
i
inhale
and
cough
i
inhale
again
this
time
with
anatoli
gently
telling
me
to
keep
holding
it
keep
holding
it
for
one
more
second


t
0006
i
inhale
again
and
again
im
not
sure
how
many
hits
i
take
but
i
eventually
shake
my
head
to
signal
that
im
done
i
briefly
smell
a
burnt
smell
before
everything
goes
dark

t
0007
instantly
my
world
narrows
gone
are
the
apple
trees
and
warm
summer
breeze
im
not
sure
i
even
have
a
physical
body
anymore
and
yet
i
feel
as
if
i
cant
breathe
whatever
is
left
of
my
body
isnt
functioning
i
curl
up
on
myself
and
have
to
physically
force
myself
to
take
in
gulps
of
air
im
in
a
void
i
see
nothing
feel
nothing
beyond
my
lack
of
breath
i
squeeze
my
eyes
shut
or
have
they
been
shut
the
whole
time
im
not
sure
anymore

im
in
a
void
i
see
nothing
feel
nothing
beyond
my
lack
of
breath
i
squeeze
my
eyes
shut
or
have
they
been
shut
the
whole
time
im
not
sure
anymore

i
logically
try
to
tell
myself
that
my
body
will
naturally
take
over
if
i
can
only
allow
it
then
i
can
enjoy
this
experience
but
i
cant
i
cant
let
go
of
this
simple
lifesaving
task
if
i
do
i
know
i
wont
make
it
ill
suffocate
and
forever
be
lost
in
this
void
this
vacuum
of
light
and
air

all
i
see
is
blackness
each
inhale
is
remarkably
difficult

its
as
if
my
lungs
no
longer
work
on
their
own
they
dont
remember
how
to
expand
and
contract
im
filled
with
this
primal
need
for
air
and
yet
somehow
i
cant
seem
to
get
enough
im
drowning
desperately
trying
to
keep
my
head
above
some
body
of
water
that
i
cant
see
or
touch
im
starting
to
panic
i
think
im
hyperventilating


a
thought
floats
into
my
consciousness
is
this
what
its
like
to
die
in
space
how
have
i
managed
to
travel
so
far
from
home


as
quickly
as
the
thought
comes
its
gone
breathe
just
keep
trying
to
breathe
it
feels
as
if
im
pushing
my
chest
outwards
from
inside
my
body
i
have
to
physically
force
it
to
expand
to
allow
in
air
there
is
no
such
thing
as
time
or
earth
or
anything
else
except
my
need
to
keep
breathing
nothing
else
exists
or
has
existed
or
will
ever
exist
again
there
is
only
blackness
and
asphyxiation


beyond
my
lungs
and
chest
cavity
i
have
no
other
awareness
of
my
body
my
spine
skull
and
nervous
system
are
gone
the
only
sounds
i
can
hear
are
my
desperate
gasps
im
fighting
a
battle
i
know
i
cannot
win
i
can
only
hope
that
i
will
be
transported
somewhere
away
from
here
somewhere
with
color
breathe
breathe
breathe

t
0009
i
open
my
eyes
and
its
over
im
back
to
my
gentle
pastel
visuals
some
light
fractals
remain
on
the
grass
and
trees
but
none
of
the
visuals
are
overt
or
pressing
i
feel
as
if
only
seconds
have
passed
im
slightly
disoriented
from
the
experience
what
just
happened
i
feel
calm
yet
im
breathing
heavily
theres
a
slight
burning
in
my
chest
and
esophagus
from
the
smoke
but
no
other
body
load
or
sensations
i
turn
to
anatoli
and
tell
him
i
want
to
try
it
again
soon
now


t
0010
we
dont
have
any
more
dmt
in
crystal
form
but
we
have
more
changa
we
make
the
decision
to
take
a
small
break
and
regroup
at
the
front
of
the
property
to
watch
the
sunset
over
the
surrounding
mountains


t
0015
i
ruminate
on
the
experience
i
just
had

even
though
it
happened
only
moments
ago
the
memory
feels
hazy
like
a
traumatic
event
my
brain
is
trying
to
protect
me
from

and
yet
i
have
this
strange
desire
to
do
it
again

even
though
it
happened
only
moments
ago
the
memory
feels
hazy
like
a
traumatic
event
my
brain
is
trying
to
protect
me
from

and
yet
i
have
this
strange
desire
to
do
it
again

like
ive
only
scratched
the
surface
and
if
given
a
second
chance
i
know
i
could
fly


now
that
ive
had
a
moment
to
take
a
step
back
im
flabbergasted
by
the
intensity
and
timeframe
of
the
drugs
effects
going
from
0mph
to
100mph
is
not
something
i
was
prepared
for
its
like
my
memory
of
riding
a
roller
coaster
for
the
first
time
i
think
im
ready
but
nothing
has
prepared
me
for
the
first
initial
drop
where
my
stomach
lurches
into
my
throat
and
i
feel
as
if
im
free
falling
its
in
that
moment
that
im
forced
to
surrender
to
gravity
or
dmt
in
this
instance
so
yes
i
had
read
about
the
quickness
and
intensity
of
dmt
but
experiencing
it
is
something
else
entirely


t
0025
anatoli
and
i
reconvene
at
the
front
of
the
property
theres
a
magnificent
sunset
happening
with
bright
vibrant
colors
filling
the
sky
against
a
backdrop
of
multiple
mountain
ranges
im
filled
with
a
sense
of
awe
at
the
beauty
around
me
i
can
tell
the
alpenglow
will
be
spectacular
tonight
anatoli
packs
151
mg
of
changa
into
the
bowl
our
conversation
is
light
and
easy
we
reflect
on
the
different
mountain
ranges
we
can
see
and
how
lucky
we
are
to
live
in
such
an
area


t0027
i
light
the
changa
and
inhale
im
able
to
hold
the
smoke
in
for
roughly
5
seconds
before
i
cough
it
out
seems
like
i
still
havent
learned
how
to
hold
my
breath
anatoli
comments
that
he
usually
hates
the
taste
of
dmt
i
dont
taste
anything
but
for
the
first
time
i
notice
how
distinct
the
smell
is
its
pungent
and
sharp
and
slightly
unpleasant
it
smells
synthetic
as
if
we
are
burning
plastic


some
light
visuals
start
to
unfold
before
me
the
mountain
ranges
seem
to
hold
an
indescribable
amount
of
depth
to
them
they
are
silent
yet
ever
looming
in
the
distance
they
are
my
witness
to
this
experience
and
im
happy
to
have
their
presence
near
me
i
look
up
and
notice
the
single
cloud
in
the
sky
its
filled
with
layers
of
color
i
feel
as
if
im
in
a
monet
painting
my
vision
taken
over
with
texture
and
bold
brushstrokes
every
color
blends
into
the
one
next
to
it
creating
movement
between
everything
despite
an
actual
lack
of
activity


t
0030
i
take
another
inhale
of
changa
anatoli
verbally
counts
to
10
to
make
sure
i
hold
my
breath
long
enough
this
time
i
struggle
but
succeed
instantly
my
vision
shifts
i
hear
a
buzzing
as
if
a
bee
where
circling
around
my
head
i
lose
sight
of
the
mountains
and
the
cloud
fuck
monet
my
world
has
been
upgraded
to
alex
grey
red
and
black
fractals
explode
into
my
vision
literally
everything
i
see
is
replaced
by
these
fractals
and
each
has
a
smiling
face
while
they
are
bold
and
present
they
are
not
frightening
everywhere
i
look
the
smiling
fractals
stare
back
at
me
theyve
somehow
consumed
my
eyesight
taking
over
everything
i
see
the
more
i
look
the
more
3-d
they
become
my
visual
world
is
now
deconstructing
and
rearranging
to
form
a
red
and
black
fractal
orb
around
me

my
visual
world
is
now
deconstructing
and
rearranging
to
form
a
red
and
black
fractal
orb
around
me

i
realize
this
is
not
the
first
orb
i
have
been
in
the
first
time
i
experienced
orb-ism
was
on
a
very
high
dose
of
n-ethylnorketamine
as
i
sit
in
the
center
of
this
ball
i
no
longer
hear
see
or
feel
the
normal
world
around
me
and
yet
the
fractals
continue
to
smile
at
me
with
their
goofy
grins
the
smiles
while
friendly
are
almost
manic
and
theres
so
so
so
many
of
them


im
breathing
heavily
again
a
thought
from
before
caresses
my
mind
if
i
dont
force
myself
to
breath
ill
stop
breathing
altogether
however
unlike
before
im
able
to
let
go
of
this
notion
and
simply
enjoy
the
experience
for
what
it
is
after
a
few
deep
breathes
and
a
second
of
acclimation
i
realize
im
fine


this
realization
rewards
me
unparalleled
visuals
the
fractals
break
apart
to
reveal
the
mountains
which
have
grown
in
size
depth
and
color
each
peak
dances
and
shifts
with
the
peaks
next
to
it
theres
two
layers
no
three
layers
no
four
layers
of
mountains
in
front
of
me
how
have
i
never
noticed
this
before
my
love
for
these
giant
rocks
in
the
sky
grows
with
each
passing
second
im
no
longer
miles
away
from
them
but
right
at
their
base
as
the
sun
continues
to
set
their
colors
shift
from
grey
to
blue
to
purple
all
the
while
dancing
and
moving
each
peak
seamlessly
shimmies
and
shakes
with
the
peak
next
to
it
to
some
hidden
beat
i
cannot
hear
i
can
tell
from
their
movements
that
its
upbeat
and
i
catch
myself
bobbing
my
head
along
i
get
the
feeling
that
its
some
kind
of
funk
song
with
a
killer
saxophone
solo
i
laugh
and
think
that
ill
never
be
able
to
look
at
these
mountains
in
the
same
way


i
somehow
convince
myself
to
look
upwards
and
see
the
stars
above
me
even
though
the
sun
is
still
up
and
i
cant
see
the
actual
stars
i
can
see
thousands
of
rotating
octagons
formed
of
a
shimmering
golden
color
their
rotations
are
slow
and
lackadaisical
they
have
no
hurry
and
no
other
purpose
than
to
simply
exist
as
they
are
their
edges
connect
to
one
another
creating
a
web
of
shifting
light
in
the
baby
blue
sky


t
0034
the
more
intense
visuals
fade
and
im
slowly
brought
back
to
my
world
of
monet
the
sun
is
fully
behind
the
mountains
and
the
sky
erupts
with
hues
of
pink
blue
orange
and
purple
i
take
a
deep
breath
to
reground
myself
in
this
moment
in
time
im
so
incredibly
thankful
to
be
here
to
witness
this
sunset
to
be
given
such
a
gift
from
the
universe
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
have
felt
so
peaceful

i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
have
felt
so
peaceful



t
0036
the
alpenglow
has
begun
the
valley
im
in
becomes
silent
as
if
every
being
is
acknowledging
the
slow
shift
from
daytime
to
nighttime
the
temperature
drops
in
response


t
0037
i
notice
for
the
first
time
two
horses
grazing
in
their
pastures
ive
met
these
horses
before
and
their
owner
is
my
dear
friend
while
usually
very
standoffish
these
horses
instantly
greet
me
as
i
walk
to
the
fence
separating
us
they
dont
let
me
pet
them
but
they
look
at
me
as
i
softly
speak
to
them
i
wish
them
a
good
evening
and
hope
theyre
enjoying
their
open
pasture
we
both
know
in
a
couple
of
weeks
the
grass
will
be
covered
in
frost
summers
are
fleeting
here
and
winters
come
in
swiftly
but
for
now
we
all
enjoy
this
easy
weather
i
murmur
a
final
goodbye
and
with
that
both
horses
turn
away
and
start
grazing
again


t
0045
my
visuals
are
back
to
baseline
now
im
left
with
a
sense
of
calm
life
seems
unusually
easy
im
aware
that
this
will
shift
by
tomorrow
but
for
now
i
appreciate
the
feeling
and
welcome
it
with
open
arms


t
0045+

the
rest
of
the
evening
is
spent
with
grilling
eating
and
laughing
with
anatoli
i
dont
feel
any
adverse
effects
from
the
changa
and
dmt
my
mood
is
light
and
easy
going
for
the
rest
of
the
night
i
have
a
normal
appetite
and
have
no
issues
falling
asleep
i
wake
up
feeling
rested
and
ready
for
the
day


while
the
whole
experience
took
less
than
an
hour
there
seemed
to
be
two
juxtaposing
sides

one
filled
with
blackness
and
a
lack
of
air
and
the
other
consumed
by
color
and
an
awe
of
nature
yet
somehow
it
felt
comfortable
to
bounce
from
one
to
another
even
with
my
breathing
issues
i
immediately
wanted
to
go
further
and
deeper
even
in
the
world
of
darkness
i
never
once
classified
my
trip
as
bad
or
unpleasant
for
the
first
time
a
tryptamine
had
knocked
me
on
my
ass
physically
emotionally
and
visually
and
i
enjoyed
it

even
in
the
world
of
darkness
i
never
once
classified
my
trip
as
bad
or
unpleasant
for
the
first
time
a
tryptamine
had
knocked
me
on
my
ass
physically
emotionally
and
visually
and
i
enjoyed
it



an
aspect
i
particularly
enjoyed
was
the
very
little
body
load
i
experienced
outside
of
dissociatives
this
was
the
first
chemical
that
allowed
me
to
push
my
limits
without
being
hindered
by
my
dislike
of
a
body
high
any
type
of
body
high
sends
me
directly
into
a
ball
on
the
couch
finally
i
was
able
to
let
go

i
found
dmt
to
be
very
unique
in
intensity
and
quickness
of
onset
the
visuals
were
very
tryptamine
in
nature
but
i
have
yet
to
find
a
dosage
in
other
substances
of
this
class
that
provided
comparable
intensity
this
includes
exploration
with
4-aco-dmt
in
the
50+mg
range
in
combination
with
agents
of
propulsion
such
as
nitrous
oxide
and
cannabis
while
obviously
intense
in
their
own
manner
the
visual
intensity
of
these
experiences
did
not
hold
a
flame
to
the
earth
shattering
adventure
i
had
today


i
feel
as
if
i
barely
scratched
the
surface
of
possibilities
with
these
substances
i
have
many
more
miles
to
go
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
where
the
journey
takes
me




my
exposure
to
dmt
came
last
year
when
i
returned
to
visit
the
city
where
i
went
to
college
and
stayed
with
some
friends
among
them
is
j
who
was
there
for
my
first
few
experiences
with
lsd
and
who
is
one
of
a
small
group
of
people
who
i
trust
completely
as
a
guide
and
fellow
traveler
with
regards
to
all
things
psychedelic


i
was
sitting
on
his
couch
doing
some
work
one
night
when
he
wandered
in
and
announced
in
his
typical
jovial
way
\x93guess
what
i
got
the
glint
in
his
eye
told
me
before
he
did
that
it
must
have
been
one
of
a
handful
of
chemicals
\x97
in
fact
it
was
dmt
i
didnt
know
too
much
about
it
at
that
point
beyond
the
basics
its
physiologically
quite
safe
but
puts
you
into
a
\x93hyperspace-like
state
for
about
15
minutes
during
which
users
report
shooting
through
eternal
tunnels
and
meeting
strange
entities
j
had
already
done
dmt
a
few
times
and
told
me
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
i
was
in
for
a
ride
we
picked
out
a
launch
window
for
later
that
week

the
night
before
i
was
due
to
try
dmt
i
was
sandwiched
around
the
table
at
a
social
gathering
with
j
and
some
friends
he
was
discussing
in
low
tones
the
construction
of
\x93the
machine
the
rig
built
out
of
an
old
beer
bottle
a
straw
some
rubber
cement
and
some
steel
wool
that
was
supposed
to
be
an
efficient
way
of
consuming
dmt
another
friend
asked
to
see
the
machine
so
we
retired
upstairs
and
j
produced
it
out
of
curiosity
i
picked
it
up
and
inhaled
through
the
straw
and
immediately
tasted
mothballs
and
felt
waves
of
profoundly
peaceful
thoughts
wash
over
me
\x93i
think
i
said
\x93there
might
still
be
some
dmt
left
over
in
this
thing
i
was
mostly
sober
and
buzzing
more
from
the
company
of
good
friends
than
the
two
beers
id
had
earlier
in
the
evening
so
j
suggested
that
i
try
smoking
what
was
left
in
there
to
get
a
taste
of
the
dmt
headspace
in
anticipation
of
tomorrows
trip
we
imagined
that
there
might
have
been
a
few
milligrams
of
the
stuff
left
over
from
previous
journeys
in
retrospect
that
might
have
been
an
underestimate

still
laughing
a
bit
at
the
silliness
of
the
dry
run
we
were
about
to
attempt
i
took
the
plastic
straw
poking
out
of
the
machine
into
my
mouth
as
j
ignited
his
lighter
and
waved
it
beneath
the
ball
of
steel
wool
supposedly
laced
with
the
stuff
at
the
other
end
\x93inhale
he
said
and
i
did
feeling
the
pungent
mothball
taste
now
sticky
and
amplified
as
i
choked
down
the
smoke
i
counted
to
ten
i
guess
making
a
halfhearted
attempt
to
hold
it
in
even
as
i
bucked
and
coughed
\x93again
and
i
inhaled
once
more
by
now
it
was
already
clear
that
something
was
deeply
wrong
i
could
feel
my
body
tingling
with
a
brand
new
energy
\x97
heretofore
undiscovered
but
now
familiar
the
faintest
background
sounds
\x97
the
whirring
of
a
cpu
fan
the
faint
chatter
of
guests
downstairs
were
amplified
and
reverberant
i
felt
my
brain
sift
these
sounds
one
by
one
from
a
river
of
noise
a
power
we
all
wield
but
rarely
think
about

i
felt
my
brain
sift
these
sounds
one
by
one
from
a
river
of
noise
a
power
we
all
wield
but
rarely
think
about

but
instead
of
tracing
these
sounds
to
their
source
through
familiar
webs
of
cause
and
effect
my
mind
assigned
each
one
a
sickly
impossibly
saturated
neon
color
and
they
buzzed
in
horizontal
rows
before
my
eyes
\x93one
more
boomed
js
voice
but
i
\x97
i
\x97
was
in
no
condition
to
move
my
body
in
service
of
taking
a
third
hit

instead
i
sunk
into
the
couch
and
closed
or
maybe
opened
my
eyes
a
field
of
tessellated
red
and
purple
triangles
danced
in
my
field
of
view
fed
by
cascading
waves
of
terror
i
felt
trapped
in
an
alien
snowstorm
my
visibility
dwindling
as
i
shone
the
flashlight
of
reason
wildly
around
trying
to
make
sense
of
where
or
when
or
who
i
was
\x93i
was
sitting
on
a
couch
and
then
i
took
a
drug
\x97
all
the
pieces
of
this
simple
thought
were
there
but
i
was
unable
to
put
them
together
in
a
satisfying
order

\x93i
was
sitting
on
a
couch
and
then
i

\x93i
was
sitting
on
a
couch

\x93i
was
sitting

\x93i
was

with
that
the
old
order
of
things
buckled
and
gave
way
to
a
logical
inversion
across
some
sinister
axis
the
facts
of
my
human
existence
time
space
my
body
and
my
mind
were
incomprehensible
beyond
recall
or
even
recognition
while
ancient
cosmic
lovecraftian
notions
of
being
were
laid
before
me
as
plain
and
straightforward
as
a
multiplication
table
my
eyes
in
real
life
were
open
at
this
point
and
i
found
myself
in
what
i
describe
in
retrospect
as
a
sort
of
bioluminescent
disco
its
geometry
taking
only
the
vaguest
of
hints
from
the
room
i
was
sitting
in
but
all
the
more
absurd
for
the
swivel
chairs
still
visibly
strewn
around
the
dance
floor
i
remember
crying
out
with
a
mixture
of
fascination
and
revelatory
horror
\x93this
is
what
existence
is
immediately
after
must
have
been
the
\x93blast
off
because
i
felt
myself
suddenly
pitched
forward
at
great
speed
and
shot
though
a
series
of
lounge-like
rooms

i
wish
for
my
sake
and
yours
that
i
could
describe
to
you
what
followed
there
are
characteristics
i
can
relay
\x97
the
surfaces
glowed
with
colors
both
impossibly
vibrant
and
imbued
with
an
odd
matte
stucco
texture
across
which
flashed
patterns
of
indescribable
complexity
one
chamber
seemed
to
unfold
into
the
next
not
through
a
series
of
doors
but
by
its
curled-up
dimensions
exploding
into
being
from
minute
details
in
my
field
of
view
like
enormous
turquoise-amber-violet
popcorn
kernels
being
popped


i
remember
this
experience
as
bound
by
the
laws
of
time
a
linear
sequence
of
events
one
after
the
other
but
i
dont
think
it
was
like
that
\x97
rather
i
arrived
at
each
chamber
at
each
moment
in
time
from
a
million
different
others
at
once
and
each
moment
would
soon
explode
into
a
million
more
in
retrospect
really
trying
to
understand
what
happened
is
like
looking
through
a
kaleidoscope
turning
the
wheel
frantically
in
search
of
some
precise
pattern
ive
seen
before
sometimes
i
get
close
and
im
left
only
with
the
briefest
impression
of
some
otherworldly
checkerboard
vista
and
a
chill
down
my
spine
before
the
pattern
drifts
again
still
i
have
retained
one
image
from
this
experience
that
feels
like
a
real
memory
a
flash
photograph
snapped
by
my
brain
from
a
camera
affixed
above
this
transdimensional
roller
coaster
and
displayed
in
the
gift
shop
as
i
exit
i
see
j
sitting
on
a
kind
of
velvet
duvet
the
walls
made
of
pillowed
squares
and
pulsing
royal
blue
in
my
minds
eye
though
certainly
not
in
reality
he
is
wearing
a
puffy
top
hat
he
grins
a
cheshire-cat
smile
at
me
and
either
with
his
voice
or
some
impossibly
subtle
gesture
conveys
to
me
a
single
word
\x93right

im
really
not
sure
what
happened
next
\x97
i
suppose
ill
have
to
go
back
in
to
find
out
\x97
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
i
was
rebooted
i
occupied
a
sort
of
singularity
a
point
without
space
or
time
that
was
infinitely
dense
but
also
felt
infinitely
spacious
for
lack
of
any
kind
of
distance
metric
from
there
my
human
existence
unfurled
back
into
being
from
a
single
point
in
my
life
being
stranded
in
the
shanghai
airport
and
missing
my
connecting
flight
this
is
where
the
turing
tape
of
my
brain
had
spooled
back
to
over
the
last
five
or
ten
minutes
and
so
the
first
words
out
of
my
mouth
were
a
feeble
attempt
to
relay
this
out
loud
in
mandarin
coming
up
with
the
next
word
in
the
sentence
before
starting
it
over
each
time
the
space
i
occupied
now
had
a
stained-glass
quality
but
its
more
accurate
to
say
that
i
felt
as
though
i
were
made
of
stained
glass
and
the
events
of
my
life
were
beams
of
light
shining
through
my
colored
panes
onto
the
surface
below
each
new
splotch
of
diffuse
light
helping
paint
a
picture
of
who
what
and
where
i
really
was
it
felt
like
coming
to
the
surface
from
the
bottom
of
a
deep
pool
or
waking
from
a
startling
nightmare
and
finding
myself
safe
in
bed
but
it
had
none
of
the
anxious
qualities
id
associate
with
either
of
those
things
rather
i
felt
a
deep
beautiful
sense
of
fascination
and
gratitude
as
i
was
handed
a
series
of
facts
about
my
existence
youre
a
human
being
on
earth
with
friends
and
family
and
beliefs
and
interests
and
memories
and
as
i
finally
at
long
last
grasped
that
\x93i
was
sitting
on
a
couch
and
then
i
took
a
drug
my
eyes
shot
open
and
i
burst
out
laughing

make
no
mistake
i
was
still
tripping
balls
the
room
we
were
in
while
now
satisfyingly
euclidean
was
made
of
splotchy
green
geometric
fragments
that
throbbed
and
swayed
the
walls
heaved
and
sagged
and
js
face
was
an
inquisitive
treble
clef
still
this
verdant
space
felt
as
nothing
ever
had
like
home
i
probably
could
have
closed
my
eyes
and
gone
back
in
but
i
was
too
excited
by
both
what
had
happened
and
what
i
now
saw
around
me
that
i
could
only
gush
in
a
stream
of
consciousness
to
my
thankfully
very
receptive
friends
i
saw
a
laptop
computer
next
to
me
and
felt
an
indescribable
awe
and
an
odd
kinship
with
this
brick
of
metal
which
served
to
ferry
our
thoughts
across
time
and
space
and
could
be
powered
off
for
a
thousand
years
only
to
be
rebooted
nonchalantly
into
its
previous
state
as
things
faded
back
to
normal
and
i
realized
that
nothing
about
the
lighting
in
the
room
was
remotely
green
i
was
left
with
waves
of
curiosity
and
newfound
eagerness
to
explore
the
world
that
i
called
home
that
i
had
left
behind
without
so
much
as
saying
goodbye
and
that
i
had
now
miraculously
been
born
back
into

epilogue
after
my
experience
with
dmt
life
proceeded
apace
in
a
shockingly
normal
way
i
slept
soundly
that
night
and
did
the
rest
of
the
things
i
had
planned
to
do
on
my
trip
reflecting
on
what
happened
to
me
only
in
piecemeal
in
the
quiet
hours
of
the
following
nights
still
it
had
changed
me
for
weeks
after
i
would
sometimes
find
myself
briefly
tumbling
through
dmt-space
when
awaking
from
sleep

for
weeks
after
i
would
sometimes
find
myself
briefly
tumbling
through
dmt-space
when
awaking
from
sleep

with
buzzing
red
and
yellow
spirals
and
zigzags
quickly
resolving
into
my
ordinary
surroundings
i
took
up
meditation
trying
to
practice
channeling
my
thoughts
through
the
deep
grooves
of
consciousness
that
the
drug
had
carved
for
me
quieting
the
ego
and
the
\x93default
mode
network
of
my
brain
and
letting
the
miracle
of
conscious
thought
simply
take
its
course
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
the
habit
finally
stuck
and
has
helped
me
to
guide
positive
change
in
the
way
i
relate
to
myself
and
others

then
there
was
one
change
that
was
most
remarkable
and
remained
undiscovered
for
about
a
month
one
night
i
was
out
with
a
friend
and
shared
a
joint
outside
a
bar
in
san
francisco
this
was
my
first
time
smoking
weed
since
doing
dmt
and
as
i
stood
outside
i
found
the
pleasant
buzz
giving
way
to
the
familiar
\x93oh
no
im
too
high
feeling
which
in
turn
gave
way
to
something
truly
terrible
\x97
my
vision
went
monochromatic
and
fuzzy
like
an
old
tv
screen
and
i
crouched
against
the
wall
feeling
terribly
nauseous
small
and
alone
for
what
felt
like
an
eternity
until
my
friend
helped
me
up
and
walked
me
to
his
apartment
as
i
took
in
the
change
of
surroundings
and
found
myself
in
a
safe
and
familiar
place
the
nausea
gave
way
to
euphoria
and
i
realized
what
was
happening
was
a
kind
of
farewell
gift
basket
from
hyperspace
i
lay
down
on
the
couch
turned
on
some
music
and
closed
my
eyes
shot
through
tunnel-like
scenes
of
indescribable
beauty
i
saw
my
network
of
friends
morph
into
the
nighttime
streets
of
munich
morph
into
a
long
strand
of
dna
being
unwound
and
translated
into
proteins
i
became
the
fourier
transform
and
felt
myself
decomposed
into
waves
i
toured
a
piece
of
code
i
had
been
working
on
and
marveled
at
the
familiar
ways
information
trickled
through
its
structure
like
marbles
through
a
rube
goldberg
machine
i
was
every
chime
and
glitch
and
buzz
of
jon
hopkins
\x93luminous
beings
i
saw
myself
as
a
healer
appraising
my
own
flaws
in
a
workmanlike
and
non-judgmental
way
and
feeling
sure
that
i
could
learn
to
help
others
do
the
same
and
all
of
that
was
before
my
friend
brought
back
pizza

[reported
dose
unknown
likely
10-20mg
smoked]
its
been
more
than
half
a
year
since
i
tried
dmt
and
the
viscerality
of
the
memory
has
faded
but
sometimes
when
i
cant
sleep
or
when
i
smoke
weed
meditate
or
even
have
a
strong
cup
of
coffee
i
can
feel
those
familiar
buzzing
patterns
of
thought
and
my
mind
grasps
a
unit
vector
that
i
know
that
if
extended
outwards
a
great
distance
will
take
me
back
to
thatplace
i
havent
made
a
serious
attempt
to
find
more
of
the
stuff
yet
\x97
i
want
to
be
ready
but
i
also
hope
somehow
that
it
will
find
its
way
back
to
me
in
the
meantime
i
think
about
dmt
a
little
bit
in
the
same
way
carl
sagan
thought
about
the
stars
distant
but
waiting




i
am
writing
this
experience
outline
approximately
two
years
after
it
happened
so
i
am
sure
there
are
a
few
minor
details
that
have
faded
since
then
i
will
however
do
my
best
to
recollect
as
much
of
that
afternoon
as
i
can

it
was
lightly
drizzling
outside
sun
creeping
through
the
clouds
stereotypical
day
between
winter
and
spring
there
was
a
subtle
undertone
of
new
beginnings
in
the
air
the
smell
of
petrichor
as
i
walked
up
to
my
friends
house
set
the
mood
for
what
was
to
come


i
am
greeted
by
two
of
my
buddies
one
male
and
one
female
i
walk
with
them
to
their
room
in
which
resides
a
large
tank
of
healthy
and
beautiful
freshwater
fish
i
sit
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
nervously
shaking
for
what
i
was
anticipating
my
friend
b
could
see
i
was
nervous
we
spent
the
next
twenty
minutes
discussing
my
anxieties
and
my
expectations
i
knew
what
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
experience
and
i
knew
why
i
wanted
these
things
i
wanted
to
see
some
sort
of
objectivity
i
felt
as
though
i
was
drifting
from
my
core
and
needed
some
sort
of
knowledge
that
would
assist
me
in
becoming
a
better
person
i
had
recently
begun
feeling
more
distant
from
family
and
was
beginning
to
have
a
sort
of
existential
crisis
i
was
an
atheist
and
had
no
belief
or
disbelief
in
any
deity
or
afterlife
so
it
raised
many
unanswerable
questions
that
would
make
me
feel
uneasy
i
wanted
to
feel
more
connected
so
i
decided
to
do
some
inward
exploring
this
is
where
dmt
came
into
the
picture

i
wanted
to
feel
more
connected
so
i
decided
to
do
some
inward
exploring
this
is
where
dmt
came
into
the
picture



my
friend
b
knew
how
to
extract
dmt
from
mimosa
hostilis
root-bark
powder
and
taught
me
how
to
do
it
we
did
a
pull/batch
the
day
before
so
i
knew
exactly
where
this
particular
dmt
came
from
this
got
rid
of
any
suspicion
i
could
have
possibly
had
before
learning
how
to
extract
it
i
did
research
on
the
substance
and
read
experience
reports
i
wanted
to
go
into
this
as
over
prepared
as
possible
little
did
i
know
it
would
not
matter
how
much
i
knew
about
it
it
would
still
be
just
as
intense
and
flabbergasting


back
to
the
side
of
the
bed
my
friend
b
asks
if
i
am
ready
i
tell
him
im
as
ready
as
i
think
ill
ever
be
he
puts
a
very
small
cannabis
bud
at
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
and
delicately
sets
the
white
powdered
crystal
on
top
he
informs
me
that
he
will
be
holding
the
bowl
and
lighting
it
for
me
which
puts
me
even
more
at
ease
i
put
my
mouth
up
to
the
pipe
and
he
puts
the
lighter
near
the
crystals
he
is
very
careful
not
to
burn
anything
just
melt
and
vaporize
i
fill
up
the
pipe
and
inhale
the
taste
and
smell
are
ancient
the
plastic-like
taste
runs
through
my
whole
body


as
alien
as
this
is
to
me
i
take
another
hit
this
particular
hit
kicked
things
up
a
few
notches
objects
became
more
vibrant
matter
was
lightly
pulsating
and
this
electronic
hum
in
the
air
became
significantly
louder
than
normal
i
had
to
take
about
20
seconds
to
let
it
marinade
as
i
sit
there
i
notice
that
déjà
vu
was
starting
to
blend
with
every
moment
i
felt
as
though
certain
human
things
were
starting
to
dissolve
i
somehow
took
my
third
and
last
hit
and
b
withdrew
to
give
me
room
to
lay
down


the
electronic
hum
became
even
more
loud
as
though
its
always
there
and
we
are
conditioned
to
not
notice
it
this
strong
vibration
took
away
my
sense
of
free
will
which
was
a
magnificent
thing
to
observe
at
first
these
alien
feelings
made
me
a
bit
scared
made
me
want
to
undo
what
i
did
but
i
quickly
forgot
about
my
feelings
and
became
fascinated
with
what
was
happening
all
around
me
i
looked
around
the
room
slowly
watching
objects
fold
in
and
out
of
each
other
colors
i
had
never
seen
in
this
room
were
flowing
like
electricity
golds
greens
reds
and
unknown
combinations
of
earthly
colors
were
introducing
themselves
to
me
i
soon
became
overwhelmed
and
decided
to
lie
down
and
close
my
eyes

my
mindscape
revealed
itself
to
me
to
be
related
to
matter
as
it
was
folding
in
and
out
of
itself
in
various
dimensions
i
watched
infinite
self-tessellating
objects
intertwine
and
glow
gold
and
red
it
was
an
ancient
and
beautiful
pattern
that
i
will
never
forget
at
this
point
i
wondered
why
i
was
experiencing
this


what
happened
next
is
something
i
half-expected
i
had
read
up
on
dmt
experiences
and
knew
many
if
not
most
people
have
interactions
with
beings
it
was
still
not
something
a
first-timer
can
mentally
prepare
for
these
self-tessellating
patterns
began
morphing
into
hominid
shapes
three
beings
appeared
out
of
the
infinity
what
felt
like
right
in
front
of
me
in
retrospect
it
was
inside
of
me
they
still
retained
several
qualities
of
my
mindscape
they
were
still
tessellated
next
to
each
other
even
though
they
seemed
to
be
of
a
higher
dimension
and
their
\x93faces
were
taking
the
form
of
something
my
mind
could
understand
i
still
remember
their
original
forms
wide
and
happy
grins
pitch
black
eyes
short
bodies
made
of
a
seemingly
unknown
energy
to
me
but
this
original
form
soon
became
replaced
with
what
my
mind
could
make
sense
of
family
i
saw
my
mothers
face
my
stepfathers
face
and
my
uncles
face
they
were
without
words
telling
me
they
loved
me
unconditionally
and
were
happy
to
see
me
it
felt
as
though
they
were
happily
humming
into
my
brain
trying
to
soothe
me
and
let
me
know
everything
was
alright


once
i
came
to
peace
with
my
experience
they
folded
back
into
my
mindscape
i
felt
the
dmt
loosen
its
grip
and
i
opened
my
eyes
once
i
saw
my
friends
b
and
l
i
instantly
remembered
that
i
had
inhaled
dmt
my
sober
mind
started
to
rise
and
i
could
see
things
very
clearly
i
was
shaking
with
excitement
and
was
rushing
through
my
previous
5
minutes
so
i
could
remember
as
much
as
i
could
i
started
analyzing
every
feeling
i
had
during
my
\x93trip
and
tried
to
make
sense
of
everything
as
alien
as
the
experience
felt
while
it
was
happening
i
could
not
shake
the
sense
of
familiarity
once
i
came
back
it
felt
like
i
had
been
there
before
a
long
long
time
ago


i
had
come
to
a
few
conclusions
about
my
experience
at
the
time
conclusions
that
i
still
cannot
shake
i
felt
as
though
the
human
condition/experience
is
partially
created/monitored
by
endogenous
dmt
when
i
inhaled
the
dmt
vapor
i
was
figuratively
turning
the
frequency
dial
on
my
perception
the
subtle
hum
that
i
heard
after
the
first
hit
was
the
sound
air
particles
make
when
they
collide
and
comingle
i
felt
as
though
humans
had
evolved
to
not
hear
the
sound
since
it
serves
no
purpose
other
than
a
minor
annoyance
another
conclusion
i
came
to
was
that
our
brains
are
programmed
to
take
in
certain
input
and
turn
that
into
a
perceivable
reality
by
that
logic
when
i
inhaled
dmt
i
was
reprogramming
my
brain
to
use
different
energy
as
input
energy
coming
from
within
instead
of
from
the
outside
world
in
my
opinion
the
beings
i
interacted
with
were
a
construct
of
the
human
psyche
possibly
ancient
this
would
also
explain
why
almost
everyone
who
experiences
dmt
has
contact
with
some
sort
of
sapient
entity


this
is
where
i
will
wrap
up
my
experience
in
a
nutshell
beginning
of
spring
went
to
friends
house
discussed
my
apprehensive
feelings
with
him
went
over
my
goals
in
my
head
wanting
to
become
more
aware
and
connected
with
things
that
matter
took
3
large
hits
in
a
time
span
of
a
few
minutes
objects
morphed
and
folded
colors
became
more
intense
déjà
vu
became
more
frequent
free
will
dissolved
humming
took
over
everything
nervousness
inevitably
subsided
saw
the
beauty
of
the
human
mind
witnessed
and
interacted
with
3
mysterious
sapient
beings
that
communicated
without
spoken
words
perceived
them
as
family
realized
how
loving
and
awesome
my
family
is
realized
how
complex
the
universe
really
is
and
how
i
need
to
be
at
peace
with
not
knowing
most
things
and
realized
how
i
need
to
value
this
moment
to
moment
experience


overall
a
very
positive
and
very
intense
experience
and
was
my
only
time
using
dmt
i
think
the
reason
i
had
such
a
positive
experience
was
a
combination
of
the
dmt
being
very
pure
white
crystals
extracted
by
my
friend
b
and
myself
the
weather
being
promising
my
friends
being
quiet
and
mature
and
my
willingness
to
learn
what
i
could
from
such
a
bizarre
experience
i
know
i
will
use
dmt
again
some
day
but
only
when
the
circumstance
presents
itself
in
a
proper
fashion




hello
my
name
is
donovan
and
this
will
be
my
first
report
regarding
experiences
of
a
psychedelic
nature
just
to
provide
a
little
background
regarding
myself
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
my
encounter
i
will
tell
you
that
i
am
what
some
would
call
a
very
\x93spiritual
personality
my
brother
boob
we
call
him
and
i
have
been
on
a
rollercoaster
ride
of
fantastical
advancements
since
we
read
\x93the
celestine
prophecy
in
1999
he
boob
i
mean
leans
a
little
more
toward
the
theoretical
side
of
our
sojourn
while
i
like
to
dive
right
into
the
more
practical
areas
which
of
course
includes
the
use
of
psychedelic
substances
for
the
exploration
of
the
psychological
aspects
of
our
perception
i
had
always
been
primarily
interested
in
altered
states
of
consciousness
due
to
their
ability
to
so
brazenly
expose
one
to
their
deepest
illusions
and
most
precarious
understandings
and
i
had
experimented
with
lsd
and
psilocybin
as
well
as
many
of
the
more
conventional
substances
such
as
marijuana
and
alcohol
for
quite
some
time
to
little
avail
i
found
that
thc
helped
to
enhance
my
attention
span
and
enthusiasm
towards
hobbies
such
as
writing
and
playing
video
games
while
the
relaxing
effects
of
alcohol
allowed
for
me
to
be
much
more
outgoing
in
social
environments
and
to
stop
hiding
my
true
nature
from
others
hallucinogens
provided
a
much
needed
and
awe-inspiring
vacation
from
the
monotony
of
everyday
life
but
had
never
left
me
with
any
truly
groundbreaking
insights
into
the
nature
of
reality
aside
from
revealing
how
dynamic
and
\x93liquid
my
perception
of
it
could
actually
become
i
had
thought
that
my
aforementioned
forays
into
the
lesser
known
world
would
have
prepared
me
for
some
of
the
more
powerful
experiences
available
to
the
human
psyche
but
upon
testing
salvia
for
the
first
time
i
was
made
briskly
aware
of
how
deeply
wrong
i
was
what
happened
in
that
instance
would
change
my
life
forever
but
that
is
a
story
for
another
time
in
this
submission
i
would
like
to
make
an
attempt
at
illustrating
as
best
i
can
the
sheer
craziness
that
is
the
dmt
trip

after
trying
salvia
a
few
times
before
reaching
what
i
like
to
think
of
as
the
\x93bottom
of
the
universal
mystery
i
became
very
frightened
of
that
encounter
with
what
seemed
to
be
the
\x93real
world
if
such
a
place
exists
however
i
was
still
very
enticed
by
the
idea
of
returning
only
under
more
manageable
circumstances
with
salvia
i
could

not
even
ascertain
a
method
of
fighting
to
remain
myself
let
alone
negotiate
the
great
void
to
which
i
been
introduced
and
i
was
hoping
to
find
an
\x93easier
way
to
get
\x93out
there
meditation
works
to
some
extent
but
could
never
take
me
so
far
so
fast
or
in
such
a
tangible
and
observable
manner
at
the
same
time
no
other
narcotics
could
compare
to
the
all-consuming
effects
of
that
simple
little
plant
i
was
in
a
fix
to
be
sure
after
spending
the
past
couple
of
years
dealing
with
severe
family-related
financial
problems
having
little
to
no
time
or
aspiration
for
uncovering
deeper
levels
of
understanding
i
felt
stunted
and
stifled
in
my
quest
for
personal
evolution
when
we
stumbled
upon
accounts
of
dmt
and
ayahuasca
induced
adventures
relating
encounters
with
entities
existing
in
a
realm
that
seems
\x93realer
than
this
one
i
felt
that
we
had
encountered
providence
as
we
just
so
happened
to
know
someone
who
actually
had
some
dmt
for
sale
at
the
time
as
soon
as
boob
and
i
got
back
from
work
with
our
pay
in
pocket
i
purchased
myself
a
one
way
ticket
to
\x93elsewhere
thinking
that
if
i
could
handle
salvia
at
full
force
then
surely
i
would
be
capable
of
piloting
the
dmt
vehicle
without
difficulty
yet
again
i
would
find
myself
deeply
humbled

in
order
to
relate
my
experience
for
what
it
truly
was
i
must
first
elucidate
my
state
of
mind
in
regard
to
the
occasion
throughout
the
course
of
my
spiritual
and
psychological
training
i
have
become
deeply
obsessed
with
the
concept
of
an
existing
\x93god
figure
in
the
universe
now
before
you
jump
to
any
conclusions
let
me
state
that
my
fascination
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
any
religious
study
or
kinship
in
fact
though
i
believe
that
some
ideas
related
in
the
bible
and
other
such
religious
texts
are
especially
relevant
to
my
personal
understanding
i
do
not
never
have
and
never
will
prescribe
to
any
one
religion
and
maintain
my
personal
opinion
that
devotion
to
any
religion
destroys
ones
ability
to
comprehend
a
true
god
to
some
extent
if
not
completely
the
god
figure
that
i
speak
of
is
simply
the
infinite
mystery
of
existence
where
did
we
come
from
where
are
we
going
what
is
our
absolute
situation
our
ultimate
truth
what
is
really
happening
here
the
god
that
i
seek
is
simply
an
ultimate
comprehension
of
who
i
really
am
beneath
the
manufactured
illusions
of
an
inescapably
superficial
reality
the
self-proclaimed
realizations
that
i
had
made
during
my
encounters
with
salvia
were
particularly
frightening
to
me
and
of
course
these
would
inevitably
colour
my
experience
with
dmt
i
intended
only
to
maneuver
deeper
into
this
bizarre
void
of
consciousness
in
the
hope
that
some
greater
sanctity
might
be
revealed
thereat
and
though
i
cannot
be
certain
of
the
validity
of
my
conclusions
regarding
the
event
i
do
believe
that
just
such
an
occurrence
has
transpired

anyways
when
i
went
to
pick
up
the
brown
sugar-like
pebbles
from
my
buddy
down
the
street
he
offered
me
some
magic
mushrooms
that
he
had
left
over
from
a
little
while
back
along
with
it
and
i
figured
that
one
couldnt
go
wrong
with
a
price
as
cheap
as
free
another
friend
of
mine
had
left
my
brother
and
i
a
couple
bottles
of
wine
that
he
had
procured
from
the
warehouse
in
which
he
works
as
a
celebratory
gift
for
me
having
recently
acquired
employment
involving
restorative
carpentry
with
boob
in
an
impossible
economic
environment
and
we
already
had
some
extremely
beautiful
weed
to
smoke
so
i
was
sure
that
this
would
be
a
weekend
to
remember
i
have
a
severely
addictive
personality
and
tend
to
overdo
things
as
often
as
is
possible
i
rarely
ever
really
regret
this
behavior
but
boy
was
i
in
for
it
this
time
i
decided
that
since
we
had
just
finished
a
long
and
arduous
week
of
woodworking
and
we
were
already
tuckered
out
for
the
night
that
i
would
save
the
mushrooms
and
wine
for
the
next
day
when
we
were
well-rested
and
did
not
have
to
work
in
the
morning
but
i
just
could
not
will
myself
to
wait
on
the
dmt
i
had
already
been
waiting
long
enough

for
the
price
of
just
ten
dollars
i
obtained
a
plastic
vial
containing
seven
rocks
resembling
amber
but
smelling
very
similar
to
old
dust
in
the
attic
of
my
childhood
home
each
of
which
would
be
sufficient
to
propel
an
individual
into
the
cosmos
of
course
having
no
grasp
for
the
gravity
of
the
drug
that
i
was
about
to
abuse
i
asked
boob
for
a
small
nugget
to
pack
as
a
filter
and
then
proceeded
to
cover
it
with
three
stones
smashed
into
powder
\x93here
we
go
i
say
confidently
to
my
dear
brother
as
i
set
the
flame
the
pipe
and
pulled
i
had
intended
to
hold
the
hit
in
as
long
as
possible
for
maximum
effect
but
almost
immediately
found
myself
scrambling
to
get
the
smoke
out
before
it
all
became
too
intense
to
endure

as
soon
as
the
smoke
entered
my
lungs
i
witnessed
the
objects
around
me
tear
apart
from
their
halos
leaving
neon
streaks
of
electromagnetism
hanging
in
the
air
around
them
which
stuck
in
place
and
then
shrank
as
though
being
pulled
by
expansion
into
the
vastness
of
space
at
this
point
i
remembered
it
not
from
any
experiential
account
that
i
can
recall
per
se
but
more
from
a
primal
instinctive
perspective
i
\x93knew
what
was
happening
and
all
i
that
could
say
before
collapsing
on
the
floor
was
\x93ohhhhh
the
sound
of
my
voice
droned
out
into
the
rapidly
shuffling
distance
as
a
wave
of
electrical
vapor
swelled
into
a
tsunami
that
came
flooding
in
from
the
right
of
me
and
all
that
i
could
do
to
keep
from
being
swallowed
was
drop
onto
my
back
and
close
my
eyes
in
an
attempt
to
escape
the
chaos
that
was
suddenly
ensuing
all
around
me
i
witnessed
then
without
eyes
to
see
the
ceiling
and
walls
of
the
room
transform
and
inflate
with
a
weightless
force
into
an
enormous
dome
of
prisms
resembling
diamond
eyeballs
peering
in
at
me
from
the
edge
of
the
world
while
radiating
rainbow
coronas
in
every
direction
it
was
as
though
the
living
room
had
become
this
great
museum
of
spectacles
that
had
always
been
there
just
beyond
my
ability
to
perceive
and
had
now
been
revealed
ephemerally
for
me
to
partake
of
i
felt
that
though
i
could
observe
the
museum
from
a
singular
point
within
the
museum
that
somehow
i
at
the
same
time
am
the
museum
i
wanted
ever
so
desperately
to
exacerbate
how
amazing
it
was
in
vivid
detail
but
all
that
i
could
manage
was
\x93i
cant
fraking
explain
it
i
dont
even
know
what
to
do
with
myself
here
that
was
when
the
shifting
began

suddenly
everything
was
tumbling
and
folding
into
itself
much
like
what
i
have
experienced
with
salvia
in
the
past
however
the
difference
is
that
this
time
i
was
still
me
and
was
able
to
see
what
was
actually
happening
the
gravity
was
shifting
but
not
without
deliberation
the
very
rules
that
make
up
the
game
of
life
were
being
rapidly
changed
ever
so
slightly
by
some
alien
persona
very
concisely
as
though
the
function
of
the
existential
machine
depended
upon
the
shuffling
of
these
values
when
i
use
the
term
\x93alien
i
do
not
mean
extraterrestrial
i
mean
truly
alien
inconceivable
something
entirely
unknowable
again
this
conception
is
totally
congruent
with
my
experience
of
salvia
however
again
this
time
i
can
actually
maneuver
and
so
i
move
toward
the
edge
of
the
dome
where
i
find
a
strange
man
standing
in
the
corner
manipulating
pulleys
and
levers
as
though
he
was
running
the
stage
arrangement
for
some
grand
play
he
works
the
mechanisms
in
the
corner
while
turning
his
gaze
around
to
me
smiling
wildly
he
looks
eerily
similar
to
two-face
from
batman
and
even
appears
two-dimensional
like
a
comic-book
character
i
think
of
him
as
being
the
museums
curator
i
can
remember
thinking
\x93this
guys
obnoxious
before
making
my
way
back
to
the
museum
showroom
in
the
center
of
the
dome


upon
reaching
said
area
i
found
myself
standing
in
the
living
room
again
effervescent
clouds
of
color
streaming
from
the
walls
into
the
vastness
surrounding
like
a
cacophony
of
vacuums
oscillating
infinitely
i
could
then
just
begin
to
hear
disjointed
ramblings
approaching
it
was
a
myriad
of
sounds
collecting
into
small
bunches
that
made
up
little
symphonies
each
one
was
a
different
genre
of
music
entirely
and
sounded
quite
discordant
uniquely
but
altogether
the
differing
music
created
a
larger
orchestra
and
i
could
just
barely
make
out
the
melody
the
song
was
beautiful
beyond
words
yet
still
i
could
not
stand
the
madness
the
rules
were
continuing
to
shift
the
gravity
continuing
to
fold
and
i
feared
yet
again
that
i
would
be
lost
forever
looking
over
towards
the
couch
i
see
boob
sitting
straight
up
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
me
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
initial
puff
i
can
feel
my
own
eyes
and
how
wide
they
are
i
must
have
appeared
positively
frightening
at
the
time
when
i
see
him
i
get
the
feeling
that
i
am
viewing
a
mirror
of
some
kind
and
i
am
relieved
that
he
is
present
my
exact
thoughts
were
\x93im
cool
thats
boob
right
there
thats
boob
im
boob
im
boob
im
not
boob
have
i
been
boob
this
whole
time
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
am
someone
else
i
have
been
the
entire
time
\x93then
who
is
donovan
i
wondered
the
riddle
was
humongous
and
encompassing
everyone
that
i
knew
was
in
the
room
at
this
point
all
going
about
separate
businesses
i
just
couldnt
see
them
if
i
tried
to
look
i
could
feel
them
though
because
i
was
them
\x93residual
memory
i
told
myself
but
i
was
my
brother
so
who
was
me
the
rules
continued
to
fluctuate
not
immensely
but
just
enough
to
keep
us
all
confused
the
curator
continues
to
meddle
obnoxiously
but
not
without
reason
i
reach
to
my
left
and
feel
the
leg
of
the
coffee
table

suddenly
i
am
back
in
the
living
room
again
boob
notices
the
change
in
my
demeanor
and
asks
me
if
ive
returned
\x93i
think
so
is
all
that
i
can
honestly
tell
him
there
is
still
a
very
conceivable
current
of
electricity
snaking
its
way
throughout
the
room
but
for
all
intents
and
purposes
i
am
me
again
and
i
am
lucid
i
tell
boob
that
i
think
i
have
to
vomit
and
begin
walking
into
the
bathroom
immediately
upon
entering
i
recognize
a
strong
feeling
of
nostalgia
sweeping
over
me
like
excessive
déjà
vu
i
said
to
myself
\x93ive
been
here
before
and
for
whatever
reason
it
seemed
so
very
sad
and
desperate
as
if
id
been
there
forever
the
area
repeatedly
assembled
itself
in
patterns
befitting
its
character
and
i
felt
as
though
i
was
standing
backstage
at
the
show
of
all
things
alone
after
attempting
to
gag
myself
into
vomiting
a
few
times
in
hopes
of
relieving
myself
somewhat
i
looked
into
the
mirror
and
saw
that
i
was
me
truly
not
some
other
person
and
suddenly
i
sobered
i
walk
into
the
living
room
and
smoke
a
cigarette
while
trying
to
accurately
relate
my
experience
to
boob


the
next
morning
we
ate
the
mushrooms
with
the
intention
of
playing
a
two-player
role-playing
game
while
tripping
no
more
than
a
half
an
hour
in
and
i
was
no
longer
cognitive
i
had
absolutely
no
idea
what
we
were
doing
or
what
in
the
hell
the
point
of
any
of
it
was
so
i
stopped
playing
and
we
began
to
watch
a
television
show
immediately
i
recognized
the
embossed
quality
of
the
picture
from
the
last
time
i
had
ingested
psilocybin
whereat
myself
and
a
good
friend
of
mine
sat
here
all
night
laughing
hysterically
at
a
british
television
show
about
survivors
of
an
earthly
holocaust
rebuilding
humanity
on
a
barren
planet
and
i
suspected
that
i
would
experience
the
same
type
of
trip
as
then
mild
and
unproductive
i
was
wrong
within
an
hour
or
so
the
entire
room
had
taken
on
this
very
distant
quality
like
the
walls
of
an
aquarium
right
there
yet
so
far
a
way
and
the
objects
in
my
environment
were
floating
on
a
tide
as
though
the
ocean
has
swept
into
the
room
and
overtaken
things
the
cat
was
being
a
grouch
in
the
corner
and
i
was
finding
this
all
very
amusing
and
enthusing
until

i
find
myself
awakening
to
the
realization
that
boob
and
i
had
been
sitting
here
doing
all
of
this
together
for
ages
forever
even
it
was
like
we
were
the
first
two
people
in
the
garden
of
eden
waiting
throughout
eternity
for
each
other
to
wake
up
from
this
crazy
dream
that
weve
been
having
i
felt
as
though
he
knew
every
intimate
detail
of
my
life
and
in
this
nakedness
i
felt
ashamed
and
scared
i
felt
as
though
i
needed
to
retreat
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
embrace
the
extreme
unity
of
this
relationship
i
could
not
face
this
reconciliation
yet
i
had
to
run
away
and
hide
in
waiting
i
felt
so
stupid
that
i
had
been
doing
this
for
so
long
the
whole
world
knew
as
well
everyone
that
had
ever
been
was
pointing
and
laughing
at
me
because
i
created
this
insane
illusion
to
hide
myself
from
my
closest
friend
a
voice
is
telling
me
to
get
up
at
first
it
seems
like
a
motivator
telling
me
to
get
up
and
make
a
better
life
for
myself
create
a
better
me
but
then
it
begins
to
twist
and
turn
seeming
more
like
a
first-responder
finding
my
body
on
the
ground
and
begging
me
to
be
alright
i
begin
to
think
that
maybe
i
really
have
been
in
some
horrible
accident
and
this
is
someone
trying
to
revive
me
\x93get
up
you
have
to
get
up
i
open
my
eyes
to
find
that
it
is
indeed
a
person
speaking
to
an
unconscious
body
on
the
television
\x93damn
that
was
freaky
i
tell
boob
who
is
hiding
under
a
blanket
on
the
couch
we
both
come
to
and
decide
to
take
another
shot
at
playing
the
video
game

we
run
our
characters
in
circles
and
stare
at
the
clouds
laughing
and
exclaiming
how
very
awesome
everything
looks
for
about
fifteen
minutes
before
throwing
our
controllers
to
the
floor
and
laughing
at
them
as
well
i
feel
as
if
i
am
at
the
peak
of
something
now
just
close
enough
to
reach
higher
and
so
i
suggest
taking
another
hit
of
the
dmt
of
course
my
brother
isnt
into
it
i
think
hes
afraid
but
i
dont
let
that
deter
me
and
i
take
a
hit
of
what
remains
in
the
pipe
from
yesterday
it
greatly
enhances
the
trip
but
does
little
else
nothing
worth
mentioning
here
at
least
later
on
that
night
i
take
another
hit
with
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
who
cannot
partake
of
other
drugs
due
to
enforced
legal
parameters
and
we
got
high
together
that
was
about
the
gist
of
it
it
was
a
very
fun
night
but
nothing
exceptional
beyond
what
ive
already
mentioned

at
any
rate
disappointed
with
not
having
returned
to
the
fantastic
museum
the
night
before
i
waited
until
early
in
the
morning
the
next
day
to
try
one
last
time
as
our
resources
had
grown
slim
and
my
brother
hadnt
taken
his
chance
yet
i
could
remember
distinctly
having
felt
as
though
i
were
fighting
the
trip
the
first
time
and
that
i
needed
to
relax
in
order
to
experience
it
fully
it
just
so
happened
that
the
wine
had
been
left
over
from
the
first
night
and
all
seemed
to
be
perfectly
aligned
i
drank
the
wine
slowly
as
i
watched
videos
on
the
internet
of
people
relating
their
own
experiences
with
the
drug
in
order
to
build
myself
up
to
the
moment
it
was
an
extremely
beautiful
young
lady
that
described
to
the
best
of
her
abilities
having
seen
angels
in
her
visions
that
finally
pushed
me
over
the
edge
and
i
packed
up
probably
a
little
more
than
i
should
have
i
took
a
long
slow
drag
of
the
pipe
and
immediately
i
recognized
having
made
the
same
mistake
again

now
i
cannot
fully
remember
what
happened
here
as
of
yet
but
i
can
tell
you
that
i
was
scared
beyond
my
wits
upon
awakening
from
it
i
recall
having
become
a
two-dimensional
black
and
white
zigzag
pattern
and
remaining
that
way
for
quite
some
time
i
felt
as
though
others
were
watching
from
somewhere
though
from
where
i
could
not
tell
as
i
was
existing
in
a
two-dimensional
universe
i
remember
a
gigantic
face
somewhere
a
womans
face
made
of
rainbow
colors
she
was
watching
me
and
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
always
been
watching
me
but
i
simply
had
not
noticed
until
now
though
she
seemed
complacent
i
felt
as
though
she
was
happy
that
i
had
recognized
her
during
the
episode
i
lost
consciousness
at
some
point
and
had
very
vivid
dreams
wherein
my
brother
failed
to
relate
to
me
his
experiences
with
dmt
several
times
over
the
course
of
a
full
weeks
worth
of
time
even
though
he
had
not
even
really
tried
it
yet
after
which
i
awakened
to
my
brother
getting
up
very
early
in
the
morning
which
led
me
to
believe
that
i
had
skipped
a
day
and
that
we
had
to
go
to
work
immediately
which
scared
me
quite
a
bit
all
in
all
it
was
a
seemingly
eventless
experience
but
i
feel
that
the
insights
are
apparent
and
i
am
extremely
grateful
to
have
been
a
part
of
it
until
next
time




some
background

ive
been
fascinated
by
the
psychedelic
experience
since
i
took
my
first
robotrip
4
or
5
years
ago
since
then
ive
ingested
as
many
different
psychedelics
as
i
could
get
my
hands
on
at
first
i
used
very
little
discretion
i
took
dxm
almost
weekly
for
quite
a
while
with
excellent
results
i
ate
morning
glory
seeds
and
hbwr
because
they
were
easy
to
obtain
then
i
moved
on
to
mushrooms
research
chemicals
like
2c-i
and
2c-b
and
mescaline
from
san
pedro

i
have
had
excellent
trips
on
all
these
substances
but
it
was
with
my
discovery
of
lsd
that
i
found
a
true
psychedelic
ally
and
in
spite
of
the
drought
that
many
people
have
experienced
looking
for
lsd
this
chemical
fell
into
my
hands
frequently
over
the
last
couple
years
and
i
ate
a
lot
of
it
and
i
can
confidently
say
that
i
was
able
to
learn
much
more
from
one
or
two
lsd
experiences
than
i
did
with
all
other
psychedelic
drug
use
combined

now
all
this
experimentation
did
not
come
without
a
cost
sometimes
i
found
it
very
difficult
to
cope
with
the
changes
that
these
drugs
forced
within
myself
certainly
they
didnt
help
me
become
a
more
productive
/
efficient
/
clear-headed
human
being
when
i
discovered
lsd
i
mostly
cut
all
other
psychedelic
drugs
off
my
menu
what
was
the
point
of
experiencing
depersonalization
mood-swings
loss
of
concentration
and
minor
hppd-like
effects
if
i
wasnt
learning
anything

simply
put
i
feel
like
my
mind
and
body
have
been
through
plenty
of
abuse
in
the
last
few
years
so
i
need
to
choose
my
poisons
sparingly

however
there
was
one
substance
still
left
on
my
list
and
how
could
i
put
a
cap
on
my
psychedelic
drug
use
without
having
tried
dmt
i
was
not
really
interested
in
being
shot
into
hyperspace
but
ayahuasca
reports
sounded
fascinating
but
it
just
so
happened
that
a
friend
had
some
pure
dmt
he
was
glad
to
share
and
i
found
some
monoclobemide
as
the
maoi
to
activate
it

my
girlfriend
who
is
nearly
as
experienced
with
psychedelics
as
i
am
also
was
very
interested
in
oral
dmt
so
we
had
set
aside
a
night
to
eat
it
together
the
setting
was
her
house
with
nobody
around
and
no
distractions
or
worries

the
trip

at
around
1000pm
we
each
ate
150mg
monoclobemide
at
around
1030pm
we
ate
50mg
dmt
each

by
1100pm
i
was
starting
to
feel
something
yep
i
noticed
a
mood
lift
and
somewhat
playful
character
enveloping
me
also
my
body
felt
tingly
and
warm
we
turned
off
the
television
we
were
watching
the
start
of
the
cable
guy
which
just
happened
to
be
on
and
decided
it
was
time
to
focus
on
the
effects

i
suggested
we
boost
with
30mg
more
dmt
because
i
knew
that
50mg
would
be
somewhat
of
a
threshold
experience
and
by
now
i
was
pretty
sure
i
wouldnt
have
any
bad
reactions
to
the
stuff
she
wasnt
feeling
anything
yet
but
she
agreed
to
boost

soon
after
taking
the
booster
dose
bringing
us
to
80mg
each
i
noticed
the
carpet
was
starting
to
crawl
just
a
bit
yep
this
was
beyond
placebo
looking
around
the
room
things
looked
a
little
brighter

i
got
on
the
bed
and
laid
on
my
back
the
two
lights
on
the
ceiling
had
caught
my
attention
i
couldnt
explain
why
but
there
was
something
about
them
i
felt
drawn
to
them
shortly
after
this
the
ceiling
lost
its
texture
stretched
out
to
look
kind
of
like
a
sky
and
the
lights
looked
like
they
were
suspended
in
space
they
were
acting
like
some
kind
of
entity
yet
at
the
same
time
they
really
werent
doing
anything

i
was
feeling
*very*
relaxed
and
calm
so
i
rolled
onto
my
side
and
closed
my
eyes
i
noticed
there
were
some
patterns
like
snowflakes
arranging
themselves
in
fractal
formations
at
first
it
was
faint
but
soon
i
fell
into
somewhat
of
a
trance
and
it
became
more
vivid
then
i
noticed
that
this
was
only
one
layer
of
my
vision
and
there
were
several
more
layers
another
layer
came
into
focus
and
this
one
was
brightly
colored
containing
at
least
twenty
hindu-looking
deity-things
dancing
in
a
line
it
was
like
lord
of
the
dance
but
with
super-trippy
creatures
dancing
instead
of
michael
flatley
and
his
crew
then
i
noticed
there
were
not
twenty
but
several
thousand
of
these
creatures
for
some
reason
this
realization
hit
me
with
a
wave
of
intensity
and
i
felt
a
very
strong
pull
on
my
body
almost
like
salvia
but
not
as
dark
and
creepy
like
i
was
about
to
launch
into
hyperspace
and
join
these
dancing
creatures
keep
in
mind
that
not
five
minutes
ago
i
was
at
a
very
mild
++
experience
if
that
the
force
and
sudden
power
of
what
i
was
experiencing
took
my
by
surprise
and
i
tested
the
waters
by
trying
to
put
on
the
brakes
so
i
would
know
if
these
sudden
waves
of
intensity
could
be
controlled
or
not

it
turns
out
they
could
not
opening
my
eyes
provided
no
relief
at
all
everything
was
still
there
but
i
couldnt
see
much
of
it
aside
from
the
occasional
set
of
glowing
eyes
which
popped
out
of
parts
of
the
room
mostly
in
my
peripheral
vision

i
turned
over
and
told
my
girlfriend
that
things
were
really
getting
intense
but
she
still
wasnt
feeling
anything
she
wanted
to
walk
around
the
house
and
turn
the
lights
off
and
i
went
with
her
the
walk
seemed
to
break
the
pull
that
was
acting
on
me
and
instead
of
being
pulled
by
the
power
of
thousands
of
hindu
gods
i
was
able
to
focus
on
different
objects
in
the
house
and
connect
with
their
energy
i
dont
know
how
this
transition
occurred
but
it
removed
any
anxiety
i
had
and
the
trip
was
now
truly
fascinating

we
went
back
to
the
bedroom
and
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
apparently
very
tired
and
probably
extra-relaxed
from
the
dmt
she
still
felt
nothing
and
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
and
leave
me
to
trip
out
on
my
own
i
told
her
if
i
were
you
i
would
no
go
to
sleep
you
might
wake
up
in
an
hour
or
two
completely
out
of
your
mind
but
she
did
lie
down
and
close
her
eyes

i
also
closed
my
eyes
again
and
felt
another
trance
coming
on
this
one
was
not
threatening
which
is
strange
because
the
images
i
saw
were
actually
scarier
i
saw
wolves
exposing
their
fangs
claws
scratching
at
me
gargoyle-looking
creatures
and
some
entities
that
looked
rather
demonic
i
could
sense
their
presence
and
i
was
somehow
in
touch
with
them
but
they
had
no
influence
over
me
like
the
hindu
dancing
gods
did
they
were
basically
just
images

now
these
trance
states
were
really
strange
several
times
in
the
trip
i
would
go
from
a
+
or
light
++
and
shoot
up
to
a
much
higher
level
of
intensity
i
would
not
call
this
a
+++
or
++++
it
was
just
the
cyclical
rhythm
of
the
waves
of
trance
coming
over
me
during
these
periods
it
was
very
easy
to
close
my
eyes
and
enter
a
strange
universe
which
was
usually
very
chaotic
i
was
trying
to
see
if
i
could
make
contact
with
perhaps
one
entity
rather
than
seeing
a
bunch
of
rapidly
changing
flashing
psychedelic
images
but
it
was
not
to
be

then
i
heard
my
girlfriend
say
there
are
so
many
eyes
she
was
looking
all
around
the
room
and
she
looked
very
overwhelmed
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
she
sat
up
straight
in
the
bed
and
kept
crying
when
i
looked
at
her
face
it
changed
shape
in
a
weirder
way
than
i
have
seen
peoples
faces
change
on
lsd
or
shrooms
it
got
huge
and
lumpy
and
then
looked
kind
of
elfish
i
thought
this
was
strange
and
not
really
all
that
cool
but
it
didnt
bother
me
i
guess
a
similar
thing
was
happening
to
me
from
her
perspective
though
because
she
said
the
entities
were
stealing
my
body

now
i
believe
that
her
trying
to
fall
asleep
was
a
mistake
i
have
read
about
the
cycles
of
dmt
metabolism
and
production
that
occur
naturally
in
the
body
and
supposedly
right
before
you
fall
asleep
is
when
this
occurs
the
most
i
believe
she
almost
fell
asleep
and
then
all
the
dmt
hit
her
at
once
because
as
she
descibed
a
little
later
on
apparently
a
huge
number
of
entities
entered
her
body
and
exploded
she
desribed
it
as
an
assault
and
apparently
it
was
relentless

i
suggested
we
take
a
walk
around
the
house
because
that
seemed
to
help
me
so
we
went
upstairs
and
she
sat
down
on
the
stairs
while
i
wandered
around
for
a
little
while
a
backpack
on
the
floor
turned
into
some
kind
of
lion
briefly
i
looked
into
a
dark
doorway
and
i
knew
there
was
a
lot
going
on
inside
that
dark
room
that
i
could
not
see
i
tried
to
will
myself
to
go
check
it
out
but
i
could
not
i
knew
whatever
was
in
there
would
be
too
convincing
and
i
was
still
completely
unsure
what
the
intention
of
this
drug
and
the
forces/entities
it
brought
forth
were

my
girl
was
having
her
mind
blown
but
not
in
a
good
way
it
was
too
intense
she
described
meeting
an
alien
family
that
was
desperately
trying
to
communicate
with
her
and
they
took
control
of
her
senses
vision
hearing
touch
to
try
to
do
this
but
all
she
heard
was
buzzing
and
all
she
felt
apparently
was
pain
she
said
they
were
learning
as
the
trip
progressed
and
stealing
her
energy

because
somehow
i
had
broken
free
of
the
anxiety
and
overwhelming
nature
of
my
own
trip
i
tried
to
give
her
many
words
of
advice

she
described
many
many
playful
and
mischievous
entities
which
were
constantly
bothering
her
but
she
didnt
know
what
they
were
trying
to
do
i
remember
reading
on
the
ayahuasca
forums
that
many
experienced
travelers
believed
these
were
a
simple
nuisance
and
that
they
should
be
ignored
because
they
distract
from
the
true
lesson
of
the
trip
since
i
was
totally
lucid
she
was
too
i
told
this
to
her
i
also
told
her
many
other
suggestions
on
how
to
reclaim
her
stolen
power
and
what
the
point
of
her
troubles
might
be
some
of
these
things
seemed
to
help
her
and
she
nodded
and
seemed
to
incorporate
my
knowledge
into
her
neverending
struggle
but
apparently
the
entities
she
was
facing
were
much
more
experienced
in
this
realm
and
they
were
constantly
tricking
her
and
outwitting
her

i
realized
this
is
no
psychedelic
trip
mushrooms
lsd
mescaline
those
were
trips
they
altered
the
nature
of
the
existing
world
around
me
oral
dmt
brings
another
universe
or
several
universes
simultaneously
right
to
my
doorstep
it
takes
experience
to
navigate
several
dimensions
simultaneously
i
believe
dmt
is
a
serious
tool
for
shamans

now
i
didnt
have
the
same
problems
my
girlfriend
did
i
already
believe
that
objects
have
their
own
energy
and
consciousness
even
if
it
is
a
shared
energy
and
consciousness
so
i
found
my
ability
to
witness
and
feel
this
extremely
fascinating
everything
looked
so
beautiful
and
alive
i
looked
at
a
painting
of
a
forest
and
the
trees
were
dancing
in
it
they
just
looked
so
happy
to
me
and
i
could
feel
a
small
part
of
myself
projected
into
their
world
i
didnt
personally
find
this
threatening
at
all

the
visuals
i
experienced
were
not
the
strongest
ive
ever
had
ive
had
slightly
more
vivid
cevs
on
mushrooms
and
stronger
oevs
on
a
few
other
trips
but
what
i
saw
was
totally
beautiful
bright
crisp
and
alive
i
cant
compare
the
visuals
to
other
psychedelics
i
previously
thought
lsd
visuals
were
realistic
but
this
takes
the
cake

my
body
felt
absolutely
better
than
on
any
other
psychedelic
drug
ive
ever
had
no
nausea
no
muscle
tension
no
body
load
at
all
in
fact
i
felt
fluid
buzzing
with
energy
but
not
tense
stimulated
energy
flowing
energy
and
warm
and
fuzzy
however
i
cant
say
that
i
learned
anything
from
this
trip
except
about
the
nature
of
dmt
and
the
potential
for
parallel
universes
i
did
not
meet
my
power
animal
i
did
not
get
any
words
of
wisdom
from
a
cool
entity
i
did
not
have
any
great
realizations
perhaps
it
was
because
i
spent
much
of
my
trip
trying
to
keep
my
girlfriend
grounded
and
comforted

the
comedown
was
both
gradual
and
rapid
at
the
same
time
the
strong
effects
dropped
off
almost
instantly
after
about
4-5
hours
but
the
mild
effects
remained
until
i
fell
asleep
which
happened
very
easily
and
i
got
a
long
and
restful
sleep
hooray
and
seem
to
be
still
with
me
today
as
i
write
this

the
depth
of
dmt
was
not
what
i
expected
i
was
almost
like
a
sober
traveler
in
a
strange
world
for
much
of
the
trip
i
could
have
been
in
public
and
not
had
a
problem
except
for
my
massive
pupils
i
will
do
this
again
at
the
same
dose
but
in
a
much
more
ritualistic
setting
i
dont
know
if
i
will
bring
anyone
with
me
or
not

absolutely
fascinating
stuff
no
negative
effects
to
speak
of
except
the
possibility
of
not
being
able
to
handle
the
intensity
if
would
suggest
having
a
mushroom
ego-loss
experience
under
your
belt
before
trying
oral
dmt
because
dmt
will
rip
away
the
ego
much
quicker
and
more
unexpectedly
than
shrooms
will
this
didnt
happen
to
me
but
it
almost
did
and
even
though
ive
lost
my
ego
on
psychedelics
before
i
wasnt
quite
ready
for
it
i
would
not
suggest
this
for
anyone
seeking
a
recreational
trip
yes
it
can
be
lots
of
fun
really
enjoyable
but
i
dont
feel
like
*i*
was
the
one
controlling
a
dmt
trip
there
seems
to
be
something
or
lots
of
things
on
the
other
end
and
every
time
one
takes
dmt
they
get
to
trip
too


whoa
earth
its
so
crazy
matter
bonds
itself
together
its
so
normal
trippy





3/27/2003

psilocybin
and
dmt

interpretations
of
your
mind

let
me
begin
by
briefly
or
not
so
briefly
stating
my
history
with
drugs

as
i
write
this
i
am
19
years
old

my
first
experience
with
any
drug
was
with
marijuana

i
had
never
even
been
drunk
before
my
first
time
smoking
herb

i
was
a
junior
in
high
school
at
the
age
of
17
and
played
drums
in
a
local
band

many
of
my
friends
smoked
marijuana
but
had
never
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
join
them
and
had
never
even
smoked
in
my
presence

i
suppose
i
must
have
exuded
an
air
of
disapproval
even
though
i
actually
had
no
opinion
on
pot
whatsoever

my
entire
inspiration
for
trying
the
drug
was
the
possibility
that
it
may
enhance
or
elicit
some
undiscovered
latent
creativity
within
my
brain

although
i
enjoyed
the
experience
and
have
continued
to
smoke
regularly
since
then
i
did
not
find
the
substance
to
explicitly
inspire
me
in
any
creative
way
unlike
dmt

however
i
believe
my
long-term
marijuana
use
and
all
its
implications
which
i
will
not
list
here
has
changed
my
attitude
towards
life
for
the
better

i
am
naturally
skeptical
about
everything
and
so
through
my
experience
alone
i
formed
the
opinion
that
not
all
illegal
drugs
are
bad
contrary
to
the
message
behind
the
us
governments
propaganda
efforts

after
researching
much
about
many
different
kinds
of
drugs
my
friends
and
i
became
thoroughly
interested
in
psychedelics
in
particular

these
drugs
were
not
addictive
and
for
the
most
part
when
used
responsibly
and
in
moderation
were
physiologically
harmless

the
mysteries
presented
and
questions
answered
by
them
the
detailed
reports
of
mystical
and
self-exploratory
experiences
people
have
had
under
their
influence
the
culture
constructed
around
them
and
the
profound
intellectualism
exhibited
by
most
serious
members
of
its
underground
captivated
me
into
exploring
the
psychedelic
world
firsthand

up
until
the
point
that
i
smoked
dmt
last
weekend
as
of
this
writing
i
had
had
extensive
experiences
with
psilocybin

a
recently
acquired
friend
i
had
met
on
the
campus
of
the
university
i
attend
informed
me
that
many
chocolates
had
been
coming
his
way
recently
and
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
was
interested

the
chocolates
i
speak
of
were
chocolates
containing
crushed
mushrooms
with
psilocybin
content

the
exact
classification
of
mushroom
i
am
unaware
of
although
i
was
told
each
chocolate
contained
an
eighth
of
an
ounce
of
dried
mushrooms
and
after
my
experience
with
the
chocolate
in
question
i
believe
this
information
was
correct
as
the
experience
i
had
was
consistent
with
past
trips
that
had
verified
psilocybin
content

i
had
bought
two
chocolates
one
was
for
myself
and
the
other
was
a
gift
for
my
most
trusted
ally
in
psychonautical
excursions
my
brother

as
i
would
be
home
the
next
weekend
from
school
the
plan
was
to
eat
them
saturday
night
and
preparations
were
underway

the
night
finally
came
and
my
curiosity
as
to
whether
the
chocolates
would
actually
work
or
not
you
can
never
really
know
although
they
did
smell
like
mushrooms
was
beginning
to
become
overwhelming

at
the
appointed
hour
we
each
ate
our
chocolate
and
sat
back
waiting
for
the
journey
to
begin

ten
minutes
later
however
i
got
a
call
from
another
friend
within
our
circle
who
merely
said
hey
what
do
you
think
about
visualizing
geometry

at
once
i
knew
he
spoke
of
the
availability
of
a
psychedelic
drug
and
before
the
trip
kicked
in
my
brother
and
i
hastily
drove
to
his
location
another
good
friends
house
that
we
frequent
on
a
regular
basis

the
trip
had
not
begun
to
take
hold
yet
and
the
drive
was
literally
about
2
or
3
minutes
down
the
road
so
we
knew
wed
be
ok

upon
our
arrival
we
learned
that
dmt
was
on
the
way
to
our
location
via
another
good
friend
who
had
randomly
procured
around
2
grams

how
exciting
it
was
to
hear
that
such
an
exotic
psychedelic
had
fortuitously
fallen
into
our
laps

the
friend
who
had
contacted
me
had
already
put
in
an
order
for
us
because
he
knew
that
we
would
definitely
want
to
augment
our
currently
developing
experience

i
had
wanted
to
try
dmt
since
i
had
first
read
about
its
ability
to
produce
powerful
visions
and
an
intense
psychedelic
experience

i
honestly
never
thought
however
that
i
would
ever
have
the
chance
to
try
it
unless
i
journeyed
to
south
america
myself
and
trekked
into
the
amazon
begging
any
shaman
i
saw
for
a
taste
of
his
precious
brew

luckily
this
was
not
necessary
though
and
i
acquired
50
milligrams
for
a
mere
and
well-spent
15
bucks

the
dmt
was
a
tiny
pile
of
crystals
that
had
a
yellowish
tinge
to
them

they
were
crushed
but
not
to
the
degree
that
would
form
powder

it
would
not
be
difficult
and
wouldnt
take
much
time
though
at
this
stage
i
surmised
to
crush
it
down
to
a
finer
consistency
that
might
enable
the
user
to
snort
the
drug
one
of
us
actually
did
do
this
although
the
intent
was
to
make
the
drug
even
more
smokable
than
it
already
was

whether
or
not
this
was
beneficial
or
not
is
subject
to
debate

our
plan
was
to
smoke
it
however
and
i
was
satisfied
with
that
being
a
familiar
ritual
and
merely
noted
this
observation
to
myself

the
dmt
itself
did
not
look
like
much

however
i
knew
that
it
did
not
take
much
to
produce
extremely
powerful
effects
as
this
chemical
is
quite
potent

introduce
just
50
milligrams
to
your
brain
like
i
did
and
i
guarantee
you
may
not
be
able
to
even
finish
the
bowl
because
it
is
likely
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
take
another
hit
after
the
initial
stages
of
the
dmt
experience
incapacitate
you

the
friend
who
had
brought
us
the
precious
mind-candy
told
me
that
the
best
way
to
smoke
it
was
to
use
a
glass
pipe
and
to
smoke
just
enough
herb
to
produce
a
bit
of
ash
for
the
dmt
to
rest
on
inside
the
bowl

then
it
was
a
simple
matter
of
carefully
transferring
the
crystals
to
the
bowl
and
finally
commencing
the
smoking

as
i
raised
the
pipe
to
my
mouth
i
was
unaware
of
the
profound
and
bizarre
world
that
was
about
to
envelop
me

\ti
inhaled
with
true
determination
trying
to
be
as
efficient
as
possible
in
imbibing
the
precious
smoke

its
taste
was
nothing
like
the
taste
of
herb
it
was
a
little
harsh
though
nothing
overwhelming
for
a
chronic
smoker
due
to
the
plastic
synthetic
nature
of
the
smoke

the
taste
was
not
all
that
unpleasant
but
not
very
enjoyable
when
contrasted
with
the
familiar
taste
of
good
cannabis

i
inhaled
as
much
as
possible
and
held
it
in
for
around
10
seconds
when
at
that
time
an
immensely
different
mode
of
consciousness
fully
and
completely
enveloped
me
in
such
an
acute
and
abrupt
manner
that
it
was
as
if
i
had
been
launched
at
light
speed
into
an
altogether
alien
dimension
complete
with
utter
time
distortion
and
around
20
to
30
seconds
later
incredibly
ornate
and
detailed
full-blown
hallucinations

the
visual
world
that
engulfed
me
consisted
of
nothing
less
than
the
most
beautiful
sights
i
had
ever
seen
it
was
a
wholly
awesome
world
that
was
bizarre
beautiful
captivating
and
infinitely
intricate

the
unifying
characteristic
behind
all
of
the
hallucinations
seems
to
have
been
that
they
were
all
sharp
angular
geometric
forms
that
stood
in
stark
contrast
to
the
organic
and
dream-like
visions
of
a
mushroom
experience

nothing
within
my
visual
field
remained
unchanged

the
experience
was
not
dreamy
or
slow
although
significant
time
dilation
did
occur

instead
the
lucidity
of
the
trip
was
altered
in
such
a
way
that
the
consistency
and
flow
of
normal
consciousness
was
completely
transformed
beyond
recognition

i
remember
thinking
at
once
that
i
would
never
be
able
to
comprehend
this
experience
completely
after
its
effects
had
fully
diminished

the
mushroom
trip
that
had
been
gaining
momentum
was
completely
drowned
out
by
that
of
the
dmt

i
had
been
experiencing
that
familiar
old
feeling
that
is
characteristic
of
the
initial
stages
of
the
mushroom
trip
immediately
before
smoking
the
dmt

this
powerful
mushroom
feeling
that
i
was
so
accustomed
to
was
replaced
by
a
new
and
infinitely
more
intense
sensation
within
10
or
15
seconds
of
smoking
the
first
hit
of
dmt

the
dmt
consciousness
is
so
dramatically
different
than
that
of
any
i
had
ever
experienced
that
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
elaborate
on
it
in
the
manner
that
i
would
like
to

if
the
mushrooms
were
still
affecting
me
i
wouldnt
have
known
it
probably
thinking
that
the
combined
effect
of
the
two
was
the
total
effect
of
dmt
because
i
recognized
no
mushroom-like
feelings
until
the
dmt
effects
began
to
weaken

whether
or
not
the
mushrooms
potentiated
my
hallucinations
i
cannot
say
because
dmt
visuals
are
widely
regarded
to
be
very
intense
it
is
difficult
to
rate
the
intensity
of
my
own
visuals
relative
to
those
i
have
read
or
heard
about
that
were
unaffected
by
psilocybin

also
this
was
the
only
time
i
had
ever
smoked
dmt
as
of
this
writing
and
so
i
am
unable
to
compare
this
experience
with
an
unadulterated
dmt
trip

what
i
can
say
though
is
that
the
visuals
were
unique
to
dmt
because
my
mushroom
visuals
have
never
been
of
the
same
bizarre
alien
and
geometric
angular
nature

the
very
first
visual
distortion
i
noticed
was
the
smoke
i
exhaled
from
taking
the
first
hit

it
became
cartoonish
in
nature
and
lacked
fine
texture
as
the
rush
blurred
my
vision
momentarily

although
the
visuals
had
not
hit
me
until
now
at
this
point
i
was
already
mentally
in
the
midst
of
a
different
universe

as
i
exhaled
my
cognitive
self
twisted
and
contorted
so
violently
that
it
dissolved
completely
and
my
body
was
no
longer
my
own

my
legs
were
not
connected
to
me
nor
were
my
arms
or
torso

in
fact
i
wasnt
even
sure
where
i
was
in
relation
to
the
rest
of
my
body

to
try
to
understand
this
imagine
disjointed
fragments
of
your
bodily
perception
suspended
in
some
unknown
and
uncharted
dimension
of
reality



because
my
consciousness
was
so
drastically
altered
at
that
point
i
was
at
once
confronted
by
a
stunning
realization
that
my
ability
to
monitor
my
social
functions
such
as
body
language
or
conversation
was
severely
compromised

so
i
tried
my
best
to
remain
stationary
act
normal
and
merely
take
in
all
the
sights
and
sounds



as
the
world
came
back
into
focus
it
was
as
if
i
was
within
a
picasso
painting



the
wall
directly
across
from
me
being
a
two
dimensional
image
on
the
page
of
a
book
for
instance
in
a
sober
state
of
mind
immediately
leaped
out
of
the
page
into
three
dimensional
existence

the
wall
gained
depth
by
promptly
becoming
many
walls
at
least
three
each
having
a
slightly
different
distance
from
me
but
all
in
the
same
position
at
the
same
time

what
was
even
more
startling
about
the
wall
however
were
the
patterns
that
erupted
within
it

thousands
of
uniform
abstract
shapes
with
sharp
elongated
tentacles
of
sorts
wove
in
and
out
and
between
each
other
in
a
fluid
motion
and
with
an
almost
rhythmic
consistency

they
all
had
a
shade
of
wood
grain
from
the
influence
of
the
walls
color
however
this
was
translated
to
the
dmt
world
as
a
bright
golden
hue
which
when
perceived
along
with
the
previously
described
components
of
this
hallucination
made
the
spectacle
of
a
wall
simply
awe-inspiring
to
behold


the
next
thing
to
mesmerize
me
was
the
very
table
that
sat
in
front
of
me
where
the
portions
of
dmt
had
been
delegated
to
the
respective
parties
and
preparations
had
been
made

the
surface
of
the
table
assumed
a
vastly
different
form
of
hallucination
though
it
was
still
characteristic
of
the
components
comprising
the
world
in
which
i
was
situated

as
soon
as
i
turned
my
gaze
toward
it
the
tables
surface
picked
up
and
compartmentalized
into
planar
segments
each
encompassing
latticed
highways
of
flowing
colors

it
was
like
a
bizarre
pool
of
christmas
lights
a
dazzling
free
flowing
network
of
brightly
colored
gems

for
some
reason
i
can
remember
noting
to
myself
that
after
seeing
this
i
could
somehow
understand
the
motivation
behind
some
of
the
visual
themes
in
mexican
and
native
american
art
better

at
this
point
the
earlier
sensation
of
social
apprehension
mostly
ceased
to
exist
though
i
believe
some
of
it
stubbornly
still
remained

because
i
was
so
enamored
and
absorbed
into
the
world
created
by
my
own
mind
it
was
as
if
all
experience
had
become
subjective
to
my
brain
and
thus
when
i
later
reflected
on
my
sober
experiences
in
life
i
felt
that
i
had
perhaps
gained
further
objectivity
in
their
day
to
day
scrutinization

this
was
an
important
aspect
of
the
dmt
experience
for
me
besides
the
obvious
implications
of
creative
inspiration

i
realized
that
the
world
immediately
constructed
around
me
was
not
the
result
of
some
gateway
into
a
hyper-realm
that
resided
in
a
dimension
of
some
higher
order
relative
to
own
existence
as
some
psychedelically
inclined
authors
have
theorized
in
their
eccentric
explications
of
these
experiences

instead
i
understood
that
this
very
world
that
surrounded
me
only
existed
within
my
own
brain

the
enormous
differences
between
it
and
my
normal
perception
of
the
world
were
brought
about
by
none
other
than
a
massive
widening
of
the
creative
floodgates
within
my
mind
and
the
waters
that
had
flowed
forth
had
done
so
with
such
force
that
my
entire
consciousness
was
enveloped
entirely

i
was
immersed
in
the
normally
latent
artistic
ideals
that
had
always
resided
in
my
mind

i
had
already
reached
my
peak
and
was
on
my
way
down

at
this
point
i
had
the
urge
to
explore
a
little
outside
before
the
dmt
experience
had
ended

as
i
rose
up
i
surveyed
the
environment
around
me
and
in
visually
assessing
the
whole
inside
of
the
barn
at
once
i
was
amazed
at
the
distinct
unifying
character
of
the
hallucinations
that
comprised
my
surroundings

everything
adhered
to
a
central
theme
what
i
perceive
as
the
ultimate
realization
of
artistic
ideals
that
i
mentally
harbored

now
this
may
contradict
notions
described
earlier
of
the
differences
between
the
experiences
of
different
psychedelics
such
as
the
dreaminess
of
mushrooms
and
the
sharpness
of
acid
trips

i
do
not
believe
these
sort
of
characteristics
of
hallucinations
are
indicative
of
ones
personal
artistic
ideals
as
they
evidently
vary
according
to
substance
ingested

rather
the
specifics
of
ones
artistic
ideals
can
perhaps
better
be
understood
by
an
examination
of
ones
psychedelic
experiences
that
synthesizes
the
visual
products
of
the
various
influences
of
different
drugs

a
psilocybin
mushroom
may
present
visual
manifestations
of
your
artistic
ideals
in
a
seemingly
more
earthy
spiritual
or
organic
matter
while
acid/dmt
may
help
you
see
these
ideals
through
forms
that
are
mentally
influenced
by
your
more
critical
mathematical/logical
tendencies

as
i
walked
out
of
the
barn
i
followed
my
friend
who
had
ordered
the
dmt
the
third
explorer
of
the
mind
besides
my
brother
and
i

he
briefly
turned
to
me
with
a
big
smile
on
his
face
and
i
noticed
that
in
each
eye
he
had
two
intersecting
pupils
like
two
new
moons
one
partially
overlapping
the
other
forming
a
seamless
black
shape

my
brother
interestingly
enough
described
witnessing
the
same
phenomena

i
looked
into
the
sky
and
the
stars
were
surrounded
by
a
lens
flare-like
quality
that
was
of
course
composed
of
a
multitude
of
different
bright
colors

the
quality
i
speak
of
however
was
perceived
as
if
i
had
been
looking
through
water
as
if
the
lens
i
looked
through
was
submerged
even
though
i
was
fairly
positive
no
tears
were
in
my
eyes

when
i
look
down
upon
the
ground
i
saw
the
crabgrass
around
me
as
a
vast
jungle
of
sprouting
clay
figures

they
formed
a
dense
fecund
little
garden
and
as
odd
as
it
seemed
i
couldnt
help
but
to
think
to
myself
how
they
seemed
so
edible
-
it
was
as
if
they
were
some
sort
of
food
like
i
could
take
a
big
bite
right
out
of
one

this
is
when
the
mushroom
feeling
began
to
come
back
to
me
and
i
could
feel
the
dmt
fading

but
the
mushrooms
were
nowhere
near
to
fading
they
came
on
strong
and
familiar
old
hallucinations
took
the
places
of
the
alien
world
i
had
briefly
explored

the
rest
of
the
trip
was
spent
mostly
on
talking
with
my
brother
about
the
implications
of
the
dmt
experience
and
how
amazing
it
had
been

if
you
are
an
interested
individual
with
the
psychological
fortitude
and
confidence
necessary
i
highly
encourage
you
to
take
any
rare
opportunity
you
may
have
to
try
this
chemical

i
would
however
like
to
emphasize
the
prerequisite
of
psychological
fortitude
simply
because
of
how
quickly
one
is
overcome
by
this
drug

literally
the
trip
reaches
full
peak
in
under
45
seconds

this
can
be
potentially
frightening
for
some
individuals
but
as
long
as
you
understand
the
basis
of
these
feelings
and
their
inherent
irrationality
one
is
able
to
successfully
ignore
them
vanquish
them
and
enjoy
the
trip

if
it
has
not
been
made
evident
by
this
telling
i
would
most
definitely
try
this
drug
again

lots
of
fun
and
no
hangover

it
only
lasts
less
than
10
minutes
unless
potentiated
by
mao
inhibitors
do
not
take
this
for
advice
i
am
no
pharmaceutical
expert/chemist

this
information
should
probably
be
verified
before
being
tested
firsthand



in
light
of
all
of
this
one
must
remember
to
either
have
fun
or
learn
something
or
both
and
above
all
else
be
safe
when
exploring
your
mind




i
first
tried
this
years
ago
and
misfired
because
the
smoke
was
too
harsh
the
following
is
a
very
ineadequate
accounting
of
my
second
attempt--and
first
experience--with
dmt


i
had
done
a
great
deal
of
lsd
and
mushrooms
and
considered
myself
experienced
in
terms
of
psychedelia
having
taken
over
ten
grams
of
mushrooms
more
than
once
i
felt
that
i
could
always
remind
myself
that
i
as
the
observer
had
made
a
choice

this
is
ridiculous


my
partner
and
so
called
trip
guide
was
an
intelligent
man
in
his
fifties
i
was
thirty
and
had
also
introduced
me
to
peyote
we
had
agreed
that
the
experience
would
occur
at
his
place
and
all
of
the
usual
pre-trip
steps
were
takenie
the
fasting
the
meditation
and
so
on


at
this
point
i
must
interject
that
my
meditations
were
up
to
the
experience
a
facade
although
i
was
not
yet
aware
of
this
fact
i
simply
thought
about
myself
real
hard
even
some
of
the
more
difficult
mushroom
experiences
that
i
had
undergone
up
until
then
had
not
purged
me
of
my
buried
feelings
of
inadequacy
and
this
is
important
to
mention
here
because
i
did
not
understand
something
very
very
crucial
and
that
is
that
i
was
not
trying
dmt
to
learn
but
rather
to
prove
something
to
myself
this
is
very
unwise


the
crystals
were
smoked
from
a
pipe
and
among
a
few
tobacco
grounds
i
was
able
to
draw
a
good
amount
from
the
end
of
the
pipe
and
yet
again
and
i
tried
to
hold
the
smoke
but
again
i
could
not
i
exhaled
halfway
expecting
that
i
would
get
the
so-called
museum
dose
of
the
compound


i
have
read
much
literature
about
dmt
i
cannot
say
that
anything
has
come
close
to
adequately
describing
even
the
most
miniscule
element
of
the
experience
i
did
not
notice
anything
at
all
in
terms
of
distortions
before
my
mind
went


the
feeling
is
very
difficult
to
relate
with
words
imagine
understanding
your
own
mind
to
be
a
map
a
very
small
representation
of
a
very
large
idea
and
suddenly
discovering
that
it
was
in
fact
foldable
and
that
it
had
been
folded
for
all
time


i
sensed
my
mind
was
flat
and
very
inadequate
and
that
i
had
been
folded
up
and
put
away
so
to
speak
centuries
ago
forever
ago
because
i
was
discarded
i
was
effluent
i
was
a
remnant
of
a
grand
theme
once
possible
but
now
ruined
and
shattered
and
as
a
conscious
entity
i
could
not
be
destroyed
but
only
amused
the
amusement
ended
when
the
occlusion
to
its
purpose
ended
and
i
became
aware
of
my
solitude
this
was
immediate
and
powerful


i
cannot
recall
the
transition
to
the
void
there
were
no
colors
or
visions
in
the
traditional
sense
i
realized
immediately
that
i
had
actually
poisoned
myself
and
this
was
not
a
dmt
trip
at
all
this
was
death


this
period
of
time
is
impossible
to
relate
try
to
understand
that
there
was
no
sensation
of
time
at
all
nothing
was
linear
and
my
ideas
seemed
to
come
to
me
at
impossible
intervals
my
brain
had
been
killed
i
could
tell
because
i
could
not
think
i
could
only
sense
the
overwhelming
loneliness
and
shame
i
had
actually
believed
at
some
point
somewhere
that
i
was
alive
but
this
was
not
possible
because
i
was
a
scrap
of
discarded
thought
not
worthy
of
keeping
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
i
would
destroy
myself


this
seemed
to
be
forever


there
appeared
in
the
vastness
a
tiny
point
of
light
i
remember
realizing
that
i
had
not
died
at
all
but
that
i
had
been
dead
then
not
dead
but
dormant
dormant
i
was
about
to
be
born


the
feeling
of
flying
is
not
an
accurate
description
of
the
sensation
that
accompanied
my
movement
toward
the
point
which
was
gold
and
to
my
surprise
was
actually
metallic
i
came
immediately
upon
the
source
which
was
a
dna
scarab
a
construct
an
insect
of
impossible
dimensions
miles
in
diameter
and
circumference


the
skin
of
the
carapace
was
polished
to
a
high
sheen
and
thin
to
the
point
of
transparency
i
could
see
tiny
endless
arrangements
of
gears
and
pinions
just
beneath
the
gold
wing
tiny
points
of
alien
light
darted
from
what
were
molecular
points
of
cognitive
energy
impossible
in
color
and
detail
billions
and
billions
of
precision
gears
meshing
quietly
and
generating
consciousness
which
was
traversing
a
planned
route
terrifying
in
its
complexity
but
beautiful
in
its
exactitude


i
followed
a
point
there
was
warmth
to
the
top
of
the
scarabs
enormous
body
it
had
a
tiny
human
head
the
size
of
a
marble
attached
via
a
series
of
dna
strands
that
had
been
transformed
into
a
clear
metal
the
head
was
unaware
of
my
presence
and
it
had
a
small
mouth
which
opened
to
speak


from
the
mouth
came
forth
the
matured
beam
of
thought
which
had
started
from
a
cog
cognitive
in
the
belly
of
the
insect
years
ago
and
had
grown
as
it
rose
to
the
head
morphing
into
a
form
of
concentrated
phosphene
light
the
beam
poured
from
the
tiny
mouth
and
became
stacatto
at
once
and
conical
in
sections
that
grew
as
ideas
and
hypnotized
me
into
allowing
myself
to
be
enveloped
by
a
punctuated
green
now
a
geometry
of
raw
cognition
without
ego
and
with
a
destination


i
rode
in
the
singular
idea
aware
of
its
purity
and
clarity
and
above
all
its
sense
of
purpose
as
it
was
not
aware
of
my
presence
and
fell
to
a
violet
montage
of
heads
which
were
dislocated
and
ethereal
but
awaiting
its
arrival


i
was
suddenly
inside
of
a
brain
i
became
instantly
aware
of
the
physicality
of
the
idea
which
was
a
note
of
music


it
was
then
revealed
to
me
on
a
large
screen
attached
to
a
gleaming
wall
that
the
brain
was
the
brain
of
bach
and
the
idea
was
one
in
a
stream
of
many
and
fell
to
his
shaking
hand
in
a
dimly
lit
room
flickering
with
candlelight
and
heavy
curtains
to
the
end
of
the
point
of
his
pen
where
it
was
transcribed
in
ink
and
solidified
forever


this
i
realized
happened
concurrently
with
the
hearing
of
that
exact
note
in
that
exact
piece
of
music
namely
the
second
of
six
motets
and
that
i
had
in
some
elusive
past
cued
that
cd
to
play
while
i
tripped
and
i
was
now
revisiting
that
precise
moment
which
occured
exactly
then
and
only
then
and
required
of
the
universe
the
creation
of
cognition
and
the
receiving
thereof
just
to
hear
the
one
note
exactly
there
in
exactly
that
fashion


i
watched
the
transcription
through
a
telescope
from
a
starship
and
realized
that
it
was
diminished
only
by
my
yearning
to
beccome
a
stenographer
of
music
i
am
a
musician
my
own
music
seemed
like
noise


i
saw
the
fatigue
in
the
wrinkled
forhead
of
the
great
master
johann
sebastian
bach
as
he
received
the
beams
of
knowledge
and
his
music
was
living


from
there
i
was
told
by
a
small
man
sitting
in
a
plant
that
i
was
mediocre
and
that
in
and
of
itself
my
mediocrity
had
a
function
which
was
to
define
what
is
great
and
what
is
not
because
how
can
the
great
be
great
if
it
is
commonplace


i
in
my
mediocrity
was
a
necessary
element
of
greatness
then
and
this
eased
my
spirit


i
found
myself
at
that
point
laying
on
a
couch
and
had
a
fleeting
sensation
of
having
taken
a
drug
and
i
realized
that
my
heart
was
not
beating
and
that
i
was
trying
to
enter
my
own
body
i
saw
clearly
the
fear
in
my
own
eyes
and
was
saddened
by
my
weakness


i
became
preoccupied
with
my
lying
everything
i
was
was
lies
i
was
a
liar
even
lying
down
i
was
lying
always
lying
my
existence
was
a
tangled
cluster
of
lies
cancelling
themselves
out
struggling
to
make
sense
surviving
only
on
the
energy
that
others
gave
when
they
turned
to
see
the
freak
who
could
not
tell
the
truth
and
so
i
had
lied
to
myself
about
dmt
and
it
was
not
a
hallucinogen
it
was
a
poison
used
by
all
liars
to
destroy
themselves
i
watched
lies
come
out
of
my
mouth
they
were
giant
glistening
centipedes
hideously
related
in
a
mutant
way
to
the
glorious
insects
of
cognition
but
bastardized
and
diminished
i
saw
broken
gears
in
their
grotesque
bodies
and
they
came
from
my
own
mouth
while
i
lay
there
motionless


i
then
realized
that
they
were
being
driven
from
me
i
was
undergoing
a
type
of
exorcism
and
i
was
immediately
aware
of
a
ram
on
a
hill
of
purple
grasses
beyond
a
rushing
stream
of
beautiful
microscopic
geometries
the
ram
had
eyes
all
over
its
head
and
beside
was
a
horse
that
was
ten
feet
tall
at
the
shoulder
and
breathing
heavily
the
horse
watched
and
then
ran
towards
a
greying
horizon
while
overhead
a
silver
sun
was
spinning
sounlessly


the
ram
had
driven
the
lies
from
me
and
i
approached
the
stream
there
were
machines
in
the
stream
and
i
was
told
not
to
touch
the
water
but
to
find
the
crossing
and
i
realized
that
the
cross
of
christ
was
not
a
cross
but
a
crossing
from
judgement
into
salvation
and
that
the
stories
of
religion
were
allegories
froming
themselves
again
and
again
until
they
could
be
superimposed
over
the
framework
of
machinery
that
was
my
own
personal
syntax


i
realized
the
glory
the
importance
of
truth

the
truth
was
that
my
fear
ruled
my
existence


could
salvation
be
truth


i
was
guided
to
my
soft
pink
brain
by
a
dragonfly
which
was
piloted
by
a
man
with
no
eyes


it
is
impossible
to
adequately
relate
to
those
reading
this
that
all
of
the
above
was
occurring
simultaneously
and
yet
in
right
angles
and
even
moreover
in
a
corner
of
what
i
was
to
discover
was
a
pile
of
powder
on
a
floor
into
which
my
eyeballs
fell
and
the
dust
did
adhere


i
got
up
yet
i
did
not
move


my
arm
was
hanging
of
the
side
of
the
couch
i
remember
and
there
was
my
friend
watching
a
ball
of
regurgitated
and
spoiled
silliness
television
and
he
was
unaware
of
my
fear
and
astonishment
but
turned
his
head
to
look
at
me

his
head
was
flat
and
it
scrolled
as
it
turned
because
there
was
no
depth
and
he
himself
was
devoid
of
depth
and
there
was
a
pool
of
idea
between
i
an
he
and
in
the
pool
an
unfathomable
depth
and
in
that
depth
a
monster


how
do
i
tell
someone
anyone
that
nothing
so
far
related
amounts
to
even
one
iota
of
the
simultaneous
aspect
of
dimensional
revelation
and
the
absence
of
spacetime
and
the
simplicity
of
observation
in
the
only-then-and-thereness
of
that
particular
embodiment
of
who
i
was
and
who
i
have
become


the
experience
cannot
be
shared
and
as
i
read
over
what
i
have
typed
i
understand
that
i
have
only
served
to
diminish
the
experience
and
turn
it
into
an
absurdly
inadequate
written
version
of
a
cinematic
version
of
a
non-cinematic
event

what
do
i
say
from
here


writing
this
seems
like
a
wisp
of
a
tentacle
that
remains
and
seems
like
punishment
because
it
involves
the
re-integration
of
an
ego
so
shattered
and
yet
necessary
for
day
to
day
function
and
i
am
acutely
aware
of
my
lies
insofar
as
i
cannot
tell
what
happened
to
any
audience
no
matter
how
hard
i
try


there
was
in
the
comedown
a
moment
of
such
beauty
when
i
became
aware
of
the
motets
playing
still
playing
perfectly
and
crisply
while
i
lay
on
the
couch
being
born


a
lot
of
people
talk
about
the
tragedy
of
ones
life
if
their
most
profound
experiences
were
those
occurring
under
the
influence
of
a
drug

those
people
are
unwatered
seeds


i
have
done
dmt
two
other
times
each
was
more
fantastic
than
the
preceding
indescribable
every
second
i
find
that
a
part
of
me
is
convinced
that
this
drug
this
molecule
is
of
itself
alive
and
was
once
married
to
us
and
has
since
been
divorced
and
we
are
therefore
in
a
state
of
bereavement
and
mourning


and
then
i
realize
that
we
are
longing
as
humans
for
contact
any
contact
with
ourselves
and
those
whom
we
love
and
that
contact
is
so
elusive
and
seemingly
inadequate
and
yet
even
every
touch
and
word
from
another
is
a
precious
singularity
never
to
be
repeated
but
only
diminished
by
retelling
and
remembering
and
finally
fading
away


i
cannot
communicate
how
my
dmt
experience
altered
everything
forever
it
was
after
this
experience
that
i
stopped
all
cocaine
and
crack
for
good
never
to
visit
them
again
they
are
my
enemy
i
was
taught
this
on
and
by
dmt


for
those
of
you
who
are
considering
trying
dmt
i
would
say
do
not
consider
this
to
be
even
a
shred
of
what
to
expect
there
is
nothing
that
can
prepare
you
there
is
no
comparison
to
lsd
and
while
there
may
be
some
allegorical
connection
to
the
mushroom
the
mushroom
is
like
a
movie
of
the
actual
life
of
dmt


anyway
i
have
talked
incessantly
to
many
people
about
the
experiences
i
have
had
and
i
wanted
to
share
these
aspects
of
this
infinity
here
if
for
no
other
reason
just
to
stimulate
thought
and
curiosity


dmt
is
bigger
than
me




we
had
planned
for
a
long
time
to
try
dmt
my
partner
had
heard
stories
and
i
was
up
for
a
new
trippy
experience
especially
since
the
night
i
ate
so
many
mushrooms
i
could
actually
see
what
the
incredible
string
band
were
singing
while
they
sang
i
laughed
not
at
the
lyrics
or
what
i
could
see
but
for
the
ethereal
feeling
they
filled
me
with
i
could
see
everything
and
nothing
all
at
once
all
the
happiness
in
the
world
filled
me
to
the
point
of
euphoria
i
was
writhing
on
the
bed
in
such
ecstasy
unintentionally
driving
my
partner
wild
he
let
me
be
in
that
little
bubble
of
sheer
joy
i
never
dreamt
in
my
wildest
dreams
i
would
ever
come
close
to
such
a
feeling
let
alone
surpass
it


now
i
must
stress
all
i
knew
before
this
night
was
that
dmt
is
found
in
many
plants
animals
and
also
humans


our
brains
are
flooded
with
this
chemical
the
moment
we
are
born
and
the
moment
we
die

it
was
this
alone
that
really
pricked
my
interest
its
seemingly
natural
as
its
already
within
us


the
very
act
of
smoking
or
injecting
it
just
allows
your
body
to
produce
enough
of
it
to
make
you
trip

i
also
heard
stories
not
many
mind
you
in
fact
just
the
one
a
friend
was
around
their
friends
house
when
their
mate
had
decided
to
smoke
some
dmt
just
as
our
friend
was
leaving
10
minutes
down
the
road
our
friend
receives
a
very
emotional
phone
call
the
friend
in
question
had
spent
what
seemed
like
an
eternity
watching
himself
die
over
and
over
and
over
again
this
shook
him
to
his
core
and
needless
to
say
hes
not
scared
for
his
future
demise


dmt
also
plays
an
integral
role
within
the
film
enter
the
void
one
of
my
favourite
films
inspired
in
part
the
tibetan
book
of
the
dead


a
really
good
film
i
suggest
you
find
it
and
watch
it




as
i
said
my
partner
was
more
learned
about
dmt
than
i
we
both
waited
for
a
moment
when
we
were
both
ready
our
budding
chemist
friend
who
i
shall
call
the
guru
kept
aside
a
dose
big
enough
for
all
three
of
us
the
plan
was
that
hed
spot
us
and
then
wed
spot
him
when
the
night
came
our
guru
decided
to
sit
out
the
journey
but
insisted
that
if
we
felt
ready
we
could
still
go
ahead
i
asked
him
questions
about
dmt
and
he
could
hardly
answer
them
instead
insisting
this
would
be
unlike
any
trip
i
had
ever
taken
before
and
it
was
important
that
i
was
ready
for
something
that
would
be
so
intense
it
would
be
hard
to
explain
to
another
person
who
hasnt
taken
the
journey
he
or
herself
he
also
re-iterated
that
its
a
very
personal
journey
and
you
must
be
ready


we
sat
in
his
kitchen
debating
a
time
he
put
on
terence
mckenna
-
everything
you
need
to
know
about
dmt
rapdancing
into
the
3rd
millenium
and
we
listened
to
the
first
hour
this
really
pricked
my
interest
but
i
had
my
doubts
that
the
trip
would
be
anything
like
terences
lucid
descriptions
and
now
im
stuck
wondering
if
they
had
fuelled
my
state
of
being
mind
experience

i
had
my
doubts
that
the
trip
would
be
anything
like
terences
lucid
descriptions
and
now
im
stuck
wondering
if
they
had
fuelled
my
state
of
being
mind
experience

i
dont
know
all
i
know
it
that
i
must
frantically
re-type
my
hash
job
of
scribbled
frantically
etched
down
on
paper
musings
whilst
still
coming
back

its
almost
24
hours
since
i
sat
on
our
gurus
bed
meditation
music
harmoniously
filling
the
room
note
by
beautiful
note
a
big
screen
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
displayed
to
us
some
wonderful
visuals
our
guru
informed
me
earlier
in
the
day
that
the
music
is
extremely
important
when
on
such
a
journey
and
i
think
the
visuals
were
there
just
to
help
us
get
started
maybe
thinking
back
they
may
have
just
been
there
for
the
guru
to
look
at
whilst
spotting
our
guru
sat
at
the
side
of
bed
and
in
a
ritualistic
manner
pulled
out
a
small
wooden
pipe
its
the
only
one
i
have
it
might
get
a
little
hot
and
with
that
he
fills
it
with
the
ash
we
created
earlier
that
evening
and
stowed
away
the
dmt
within
the
pipe
we
discuss
how
i
am
physically
going
to
do
this
and
its
agreed
that
it
shall
be
burned
on
my
behalf
this
way
i
can
concentrate
on
the
slow
deliberate
intake
needed
for
this
to
work
i
am
also
going
to
take
the
leap
first
decided
by
an
old
rhyme
ip
dip
dog
you
get
the
idea

with
the
pipe
fastened
lightly
between
my
lips
i
suck
as
slow
as
i
can
the
back
of
my
head
begins
to
tingle
that
bit
where
carlson
shoots
the
dog
in
of
mice
and
men
and
so
believe
that
this
is
when
i
should
stop
i
laid
back
i
felt
the
room
wobble
into
a
haze
this
is
it
i
thought
as
our
guru
wishes
me
good
luck
and
starts
to
issue
my
partner
a
return
ticket
to
a
world
of
psychedelia
and
noting
i
was
bummed
the
wait
felt
like
it
was
for
nothing
but
i
didnt
say
anything
as
my
partner
was
on
his
way
and
i
didnt
want
to
ruin
it
in
any
way
for
him
so
i
sat
there
looked
at
our
guru
and
asked
when
it
should
kick
in
and
he
announced
that
maybe
another
pipe
would
do
i
should
suck
it
in
slower
hold
it
in
longer
and
breathe
out
with
less
ferociousness
i
head
his
direction
and
realize
my
partner
was
in
the
same
boat

we
started
over
this
time
i
was
determined
to
follow
instruction
and
so
treated
the
pipe
like
a
tunnel
ive
always
held
my
breath
under
tunnels
for
no
reason
and
now
its
a
habit
so
i
took
a
long
breath
in
sucked
on
the
teat
of
dmt
until
it
hurt
laid
back
and
held
it
in
further
then
when
i
felt
like
i
was
going
to
explode
slightly
convulsing
instead
of
breathing
out
i
breathed
in
more
now
an
intense
pain
aroused
my
senses
the
room
had
a
certain
goopy
fuzz
about
it
and
i
was
there
laying
on
this
bed
and
the
edges
of
my
vision
were
turning
black
the
world
turning
into
fractals
and
conversation
turning
ever
distant
it
was
at
the
point
also
that
i
was
gasping
and
i
had
to
remember
to
breathe
out
before
i
forgot
how
then
it
happened

the
black
broken
edges
of
my
vision
came
in
more
the
world
sped
up
and
the
room
was
no
longer
a
room
but
a
spinning
vortex
like
a
mandala
made
from
all
the
broken
parts
of
reality
this
was
it
i
thought
im
not
going
any
further
and
then
bam
neon
colours
fly
past
black
then
colour
black
then
colour
black
then
colour
flashing
fast
i
cant
remember
if
they
were
closing
and
opening
portals
or
just
that
i
was
smashing
through
each
one
neon
colours
so
perfect
they
could
not
be
manifested
by
anything
i
could
dream
up
i
later
remembered
the
sound
that
was
lost
on
me
when
i
first
scribbled
down
my
travelogue
if
you
will
the
sound
was
akin
to
electricity
imagine
standing
near
a
load
of
pylons
and
you
can
slightly
hear
the
buzzing
of
the
energy
within
that
but
more
intense
before
i
knew
it
i
was
in
a
black
box
with
edges
generating
pure
colour
and
light
at
its
edges
it
feels
like
an
old
80s
game
theres
no
real
detail
anywhere
i
fell
like
ive
smashed
through
glass
thats
what
it
looked
like
upon
entry
but
it
didnt
hurt
nothing
hurt
this
was
intense
everything
lasted
seconds
at
a
time
but
it
was
long
enough
for
me
to
take
in


as
i
begin
to
look
around
im
not
walking
sitting
or
standing
im
just
there
its
like
i
didnt
have
a
body
any
more
i
was
just
there
this
was
something
i
wasnt
thinking
about
at
the
time
these
strange
but
lovely
faces
crowded
me
i
cant
see
more
then
their
love-filled
smiley
ecstatic
faces


these
faces
where
manifested
by
fragile
strands
of
neon
strings
of
light
green
blue
and
yellow
they
smiled
big
smiles
constantly
as
if
someone
had
carved
a
permanent
state
of
joy
across
their
beautiful
faces
they
had
pointed
ears
and
hair
that
defied
gravity
if
you
could
call
it
hair
as
it
was
more
like
light
particles
flowing
into
the
surroundings
and
being
slowly
enveloped
by
the
darkness
every
look
they
give
me
fills
me
with
an
energy
ive
never
experienced
before
and
its
at
this
moment
i
realize
how
weightless
i
am
they
spoke
at
once
not
the
same
words
or
in
unison
more
like
when
you
get
a
group
together
and
everyone
has
something
different
to
say
and
cant
wait
for
the
next
person
to
stop
it
was
pandemonium
i
wish
i
took
in
how
many
there
where
every
noise
echoes
and
is
so
loud
i
could
barely
take
it
every
face
is
so
familiar
yet
i
am
pretty
sure
i
have
never
encountered
these
beings
before
i
feel
like
one
of
them
at
this
point
sure
i
was
one
of
them
now
i
think
back


i
was
colour
and
light
in
the
darkness
the
darkness
swallowing
all
of
that
up
but
thats
fine
we
have
enough


while
they
make
a
certain
contact
with
me
i
finally
feel
i
can
move
the
taste
upon
entry
i
realise
was
acidic
my
spit
turned
thick
and
i
couldnt
swallow
it
felt
as
though
i
was
wet
with
sweat
and
dribbling

the
taste
upon
entry
i
realise
was
acidic
my
spit
turned
thick
and
i
couldnt
swallow
it
felt
as
though
i
was
wet
with
sweat
and
dribbling

so
i
touch
my
head
im
sure
im
covered
in
beads
of
sweat
this
makes
me
feel
embarrassed
but
the
feeling
of
assurance
washes
over
me
they
were
so
concerned
elated
and
caring
they
spoke
in
sounds
that
i
could
not
understand
but
i
could
feel
what
they
were
trying
to
disclose
express
impart
i
felt
every
word
in
their
dialect
and
i
understood
they
wanted
me
to
be
safe
and
wished
to
give
me
sustenance
even
now
that
doesnt
feel
like
the
right
word
they
were
wishing
to
make
me
more
of
who
i
was
who
i
am
they
hoped
it
all
wasnt
too
much
for
me
and
i
was
there
i
felt
like
i
was
floating
through
space
the
blackness
swallowing
the
light
these
being
where
emitting
surrounding
by
friends
and
family
i
hadnt
seen
in
so
long
their
elation
was
really
out
of
this
world
i
felt
as
if
i
had
gone
to
a
chaotic
war
zone
and
come
back
safe
its
all
i
felt
they
wanted


i
could
have
been
dying
overdosing
somehow
or
even
dead
but
that
didnt
feel
as
though
it
mattered
at
all
i
was
awash
with
peace
love
and
serenity
if
this
was
nirvana
i
would
not
be
surprised

the
whole
event
was
so
intense
i
almost
panicked
but
those
faces
they
stopped
that
along
with
the
sense
that
my
partner
was
there
in
everything
part
of
it
all
a
little
overly
romantic
but
thats
how
it
was
my
meeting
with
the
apparitions
was
fleeting
as
soon
as
i
could
grasp
what
was
going
on
the
room
came
slowly
back
into
focus
i
could
see
the
outlines
of
the
posters
and
i
could
see
my
hands
grasping
water
on
my
lap
as
i
sat
upright
on
the
bed
i
had
no
idea
i
was
sitting
that
part
of
me
was
lost
but
the
colours
are
still
floating
through
the
room
and
the
faces
were
more
like
ghosts


im
still
tripping
even
though
i
am
back
in
the
room
i
can
hear
conversation
now
but
it
sounds
foreign
and
a
wash
of
euphoria
engulfs
me
all
i
can
do
is
smile
i
felt
like
nothing
but
part
of
everything
this
was
happiness
i
had
never
experienced
before
to
be
truly
connected
and
accepted
they
were
so
happy
to
see
me
and
pulled
me
in
and
filled
me
with
warmth
infinite
i
could
have
drowned
in
that
those
around
me
are
slowly
morphing
into
their
human
shells
and
i
am
left
taking
in
what
had
happened
so
fast
so
slow
and
sudden


i
cannot
thank
our
guru
friend
enough
as
the
world
came
into
focus
more
one
of
the
faded
faces
molded
into
his
smiling
human
shell
and
i
felt
as
if
i
was
finally
coming
back
to
earth
relief
bittersweet
these
two
my
guru
and
my
partner
were
a
great
human
alleviation
to
what
i
had
just
experienced
how
fast
and
far
had
i
traveled
the
only
way
i
could
explain
it
would
be
as
if
i
was
an
elastic
band
expanding
slowly
out
and
then
super
fastback
to
my
original
state
but
that
doesnt
feel
right

the
neon
green
curtain
remained
for
a
few
minutes
after
the
initial
trip
i
felt
sick
travel
sick
i
was
sure
at
this
point
i
had
just
been
sling
shotted
across
dimensions
at
the
speed
of
light
but
i
still
found
the
travel
sickness
confusing
i
did
have
saveloy
and
chips
a
good
few
hours
before
and
i
felt
a
red/pink
feeling
slime
its
way
up
my
insides
our
guru
is
quick
with
a
bin
and
water
but
this
throwing
up
feels
excellent
like
i
was
expelling
all
the
pain
and
suffering
that
might
have
been
there
before
even
if
i
didnt
notice
it
breeding
inside
of
me

ive
never
felt
so
much
at
peace
then
at
that
moment
even
while
im
writing
this
the
veil
still
shrouds
me
as
i
sobered
up
the
colours
began
to
wash
away
but
i
still
felt
weightless
it
was
like
ive
just
experienced
an
intense
orgasm
but
really
that
doesnt
even
come
close
to
how
the
whole
experience
felt


even
now
as
i
write
this
its
like
they
have
cleansed
me
of
all
my
physical
and
mental
pain
i
thought
my
partner
had
made
it
to
the
same
place
i
thought
he
could
see
what
i
saw
but
he
didnt
i
felt
him
in
everything
though
its
such
a
shame
that
he
only
got
to
see
the
trip
and
not
what
i
felt
was
the
destination
he
zoned
out
but
was
still
aware
of
this
planet
and
maybe
who
he
was
he
didnt
leave
the
room
basically


my
mind
definitely
went
somewhere
and
i
feel
as
if
my
soul
has
been
massaged
from
the
very
core
thinking
back
it
was
akin
to
a
gas
trip
the
taste
the
chaos
but
much
more
spiritual
more
personal
and
it
felt
less
random
and
unlike
gas
ill
be
in
line
for
when
the
next
travel
tickets
are
produced

i
wrote
this
little
over
24hours
after
the
trip
i
meditated
on
the
sensations
and
found
similes
to
better
explain
what
i
could
remember
if
our
guru
didnt
hand
me
paper
whilst
i
recounted
the
journey
much
of
that
would
have
been
lost
i
even
did
drawings
i
would
have
forgotten
a
lot
of
what
you
have
just
read
if
it
was
not
for
that
pad

i
would
have
forgotten
a
lot
of
what
you
have
just
read
if
it
was
not
for
that
pad



if
your
ever
going
to
take
that
trip
have
paper
by
you
just
in
case
you
break
through
you
wont
regret
it

my
hope
is
that
i
can
try
the
lucid
dreaming
technique
and
maybe
even
one
day
venture
further
into
the
void
it
doesnt
matter
if
my
trip
could
have
been
influenced
i
dont
believe
it
was
i
could
not
think
at
all
while
this
was
happening
i
was
just
there




thinking
back
also
i
believe
that
very
possibly
this
dmt
could
be
attributed
to
finding
complete
enlightenment
if
some
monks
can
control
certain
muscles
and
parts
of
their
body
whats
stopping
them
from
accessing
that
part
of
their
brain
stimulating
the
dimethyltryptamine
and
finding
complete
enlightenment
its
only
one
small
theory
of
mine
all
i
know
is
that
since
since
the
journey
my
anxiety
has
faded
and
i
am
so
at
peace
with
the
world

and
why
the
title
you
ask
well
thats
the
rule
with
the
guru
when
he
makes
a
batch
the
first
one
is
always
free




this
was
my
first
experience
with
dmt
i
decided
to
do
a
small-ish
dose
to
get
to
know
this
magical
substance
before
experimenting
with
larger
doses
i
obtained
250mg
of
this
powder
in
an
off-white/yellowish
powder
i
split
it
into
5
equal
piles
then
split
one
of
those
into
two
smaller
piles
i
eyeballed
25-30mg
but
afterward
i
decided
i
really
need
a
001g
scale
to
be
more
precise
with
this
stuff
its
powerful

method
i
read
up
on
various
means
of
vaporizing
dmt
i
decided
to
go
with
the
plastic
bottle
method
for
its
cheapness
and
ease
and
i
have
to
say
im
happy
with
it
i
got
one
of
those
fat
gatorade
bottles
and
cut
off
the
bottom
i
then
used
the
cap
and
two
sheets
of
aluminum
foil
and
formed
a
bowl
in
the
foil
with
the
cap
dmt
will
run
from
the
flame
so
the
bowl
is
essential
this
was
is
also
nice
as
i
could
take
my
time
vaporizing
the
powder/crystals
with
the
cap
on
and
fill
the
bottle
completely
before
taking
my
hit
i
took
the
whole
bottle
in
one
hit

mindset/setting
im
a
busy
grad
student
right
now
im
just
winding
up
the
semester
and
figured
with
how
short
the
trip
is
and
the
lack
of
hangover
that
i
could
do
this
on
a
friday
night
with
little
consequence
im
a
practicing
buddhist
i
began
prepping
my
room
the
day
before
by
cleaning
and
organizing
i
believe
its
very
important
to
have
a
welcoming
space
for
doing
drugs
in
based
on
experience
i
have
experience
with
mdma
lsd
shrooms
2c-b
xanax
and
a
lot
of
pot
dmt
is
a
bit
intimidating
so
i
broke
my
usual
habit
of
diving
into
drugs
head
first
and
aimed
for
a
smallish
dose
ive
recently
made
personal
breakthroughs
in
regard
to
self-compassion
and
surrendering
to
my
experience
instead
of
fighting
it
this
helped
with
engaging
with
the
trip
without
fear
but
i
was
certainly
nervous
i
built
my
rig
for
smoking
at
around
10pm
and
spend
the
next
hour
with
light
music
and
cleaned
my
room
then
i
created
a
nest
with
a
couple
blankets
and
my
meditation
cushion
i
prepped
the
dose
and
loaded
the
device
i
lit
incense
and
a
couple
candles
around
my
room
with
one
directly
in
front
of
me
as
ive
heard
recommended
to
have
a
focal
point
as
the
trip
comes
on
i
meditated
for
20
minutes
prior
to
dosing
i
set
an
intention
to
surrender
to
the
experience
and
not
try
to
interact
with
any
beings
i
may
encounter
but
just
to
share
the
space
with
them
and
try
to
be
observant
and
peaceful
on
the
day
of
i
didnt
have
any
other
substances
besides
caffeine
chai
that
i
sipped
through
the
morning
and
afternoon
i
was
effectively
sober
at
time
of
ingestion
i
had
smoked
half
a
pack
of
cigarettes
my
first
tobacco
of
any
kind
in
three
months
in
the
three
days
previous
to
the
trip
i
tossed
the
rest
of
the
pack
and
saved
one
for
post-trip
contemplation

dosing
after
my
meditation
at
1135pm
i
felt
ready
to
dive
right
in
i
grabbed
my
rig
and
used
the
flame
of
a
utility
lighter
to
go
around
the
outside
of
the
bowl
shape
thus
hopefully
vaping
the
powder
evenly
and
preventing
it
from
running
which
would
be
more
likely
if
i
just
held
it
dead
center
under
the
powder
the
bottle
filled
with
milky
white
smoke
and
as
soon
as
i
was
convinced
id
vaped
all
the
powder
i
took
one
deep
breath
exhaled
unscrewed
the
cap
and
took
the
whole
bottle
full
in
one
pull
and
held
for
approximately
10
seconds
the
smoke
wasnt
too
harsh
a
bit
plastic-y
tasting
but
nothing
harsh
enough
to
make
me
cough

trip
all
the
sudden
the
fireplace
in
front
of
me
with
the
candle
placed
in
front
of
it
stretches
and
is
taking
on
an
interesting
geometric
pattern
geometric
patterns
take
over
my
field
of
vision
then
i
start
to
contact
the
dome
there
are
beings
there
it
is
all
quite
intense
i
pull
out
of
it
at
one
point
for
a
sip
of
water
and
go
back
im
shifting
between
very
bright
colorful
geometric
patterns
twisting
and
whirring
and
a
scene
of
colorful
beings
lots
a
neon
pink
lime
green
navy
blue
and
gold


the
beings
are
riding
bikes
the
ones
i
remember
most
clearly
are
a
couple
that
rides
bike
to
an
apartment
complex
and
run
inside
together
they
are
cheerful
and
appear
happy/carefree
at
this
point
i
need
to
lay
down
on
the
floor
my
thoughts
are
going
many
places
the
most
prominent
awareness
is
the
intensity
of
this
and
the
feeling
that
im
not
quite
in
the
right
mindset/physical
health
to
go
much
further
with
this
substance
right
now

i
begin
to
come
down
its
all
felt
like
a
very
very
concentrated
acid
trip
i
go
in
and
out
with
some
geometric
patterns
the
fireplace
and
candle
are
still
geometric
a
calming
and
beautiful
scene
i
made
for
myself
the
collage
on
my
wall
is
vibrant
and
warm
i
get
a
brief
moment
of
self-love
as
i
pull
out
more
and
more
im
very
happy
i
took
the
size
of
dose
i
did
i
am
assured
that
i
received
good
product
and
know
how
to
approach
dmt
in
the
future
the
whole
thing
is
effectively
over
with
some
glowing
at
1143pm
approximately
8
minutes
in
total

i
step
outside
and
smoke
my
cigarette
i
dont
feel
a
whole
lot
different
than
i
did
before
this
wasnt
any
spiritual
awakening
and
i
didnt
gain
much
insight
it
was
a
beautiful
little
introductory
dose
and
i
look
forward
to
taking
another
ride

takeaway
overall
dmt
is
an
extremely
intense
substance
the
trip
could
be
quite
frightening
especially
if
my
mental
and
physical
health
werent
strong
i
found
myself
really
feeling
the
impact
of
the
few
days
of
cigarettes
on
my
body
i
resolved
to
abstain
from
cigarettes
and
spend
more
time
meditating
and
exercising
before
i
approach
this
substance
again
im
planning
on
at
least
a
week
before
my
second
dose


i
really
want
to
breakthrough
and
see
what
i
can
make
contact
with
the
scenes
i
was
immersed
within
were
beautiful
cheerful
this
substance
has
such
mystical
potential
im
still
a
bit
intimidated
but
quite
excited
for
more
exploration




intro
ever
since
i
was
15
years
old
i
discovered
drugs
i
made
a
list
off
what
seemed
interesting
i
soon
discovered
psychedelics
drugs
that
open
the
mind
to
new
perspective
i
made
a
list
of
what
i
would
want
to
use
and
what
not
i
added
dmt
to
my
list
of
dos
but
was
careful
with
it
i
knew
i
could
not
just
use
dmt
without
preparation
and
wisdom
gained
from
lesser
psycho-active
drugs
i
was
only
15
years
old
and
the
id
scared
me

for
6
years
i
grew
used
to
the
altered
mind
psychedelic
drugs
force
on
me
i
started
with
marijuana
then
next
psilocybin
mushrooms
i
used
them
twice
and
lost
control
once
i
knew
i
was
not
ready
i
still
felt
scared
last
year
i
used
lsd
once
a
low
dose
i
controlled
it
so
i
knew
it
was
time
and
i
was
exited
to
the
id
of
using
dmt

so
in
the
summer
off
2013
when
i
was
21
years
old
i
visited
a
good
friend
who
had
made
me
n-n-dmt
himself
it
wasnt
pure
he
said
about
70%
dmt
and
30%
chemical
residue
he
has
been
my
friend
for
over
10
years
so
he
told
me
the
risks
truthfully
and
said
\x93
so
how
about
it
i
got
scared
and
thought
to
myself
wait
what
you
mean
now

now
he
said
he
told
me
he
tried
using
it
himself
but
he
has
weak
lungs
he
couldnt
hold
the
dmt
smoke
in
lung
enough
to
break
through
but
he
knew
my
lungs
could
take
a
lot
more
he
was
right
i
asked
him
should
we
go
outside
to
a
park
he
looked
at
me
with
a
frown
and
said
\x93you
sure
you
know
what
dmt
will
do
to
you
you
wont
be
able
to
walk
at
all
i
didnt
really
comprehend
what
that
meant
i
figured
it
was
like
being
really
high
so
i
asked
him
should
i
light
a
joint
during
the
dmt
trip
again
he
frowned
and
said
\x93my
friend
you
wont
be
able
to
do
anything
at
all
youll
be
gone
mate
gone
from
earth
in
retrospect
i
dont
think
i
knew
what
that
meant

the
room
i
was
in
was
a
student
dorm
a
small
one
maybe
10
square
meters
his
room
was
decorated
with
psychedelic
art
and
classy
paintings
he
played
the
sacred
spirit
album
from
his
laptop
and
dims
the
light
i
got
really
nerves
and
to
be
truthful
more
then
a
little
scared
he
told
me
\x93take
three
hits
full
hits
keep
it
in
your
lungs
for
as
long
as
you
can
so
i
asked
him
for
the
pipe
he
told
me
\x93no
ill
hold
it
you
just
hit
it
now
go
sit
on
the
bed
youll
fall
down
so
thats
what
i
did


he
took
the
pipe
most
junky
pipe
i
have
ever
witnessed
in
my
life
it
was
a
homemade
plastic
crack
pipe
i
looked
at
him
and
said
seriously
he
filled
it
with
over
50mg
of
dmt
excluding
the
residue
that
was
still
in
the
pipe
and
pre-heated
it
smoke
was
coming
out
now
and
i
was
nerve-racked
\x93hit
it
he
said


onset
so
i
leaned
closer
and
took
a
hit
for
over
3
seconds
the
smoke
was
in
my
lungs
for
only
2
seconds
and
it
hit
me
like
a
bulldozer
it
tasted
and
felt
terrible
the
worst
smoke
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
like
plastic
burning
in
my
lungs
i
started
to
hallucinate
heavily
eyes
were
opening
in
the
curtains
the
wall
started
to
vibrate
i
could
hear
my
friend
say
\x93one
more
time
but
i
couldnt
see
him
his
voice
was
heavily
altered
like
it
was
being
played
though
a
computer
and
being
played
with
the
pitch
was
lower
and
it
was
like
he
talked
in
slow-motion
so
i
hit
it
again
this
time
i
was
starting
to
get
really
dizzy
and
heavy
a
faint
noise
was
starting
to
arise
in
the
room
much
like
sound
distortion
i
felt
like
i
had
trouble
breathing
now
and
starting
sweating
i
couldnt
hear
the
music
anymore
and
could
barely
see
anything
but
the
sound
distorting
was
getting
louder
i
knew
i
didnt
have
long
\x93one
more
time
he
said
so
i
took
a
third
hit
and
fell
i
could
hear
him
say
\x93one
more
time
and
with
all
the
strength
i
could
muster
i
answered
\x93no
enough
but
it
was
like
i
to
spoke
in
slow-motion
the
sound
distorting
was
embracing
me
like
a
mother
embracing
her
child
i
felt
strange

the
sound
distorting
was
embracing
me
like
a
mother
embracing
her
child
i
felt
strange

i
didnt
comprehend
what
was
happening
to
me
what
is
this
where
am
i
what
happened

i
asked
all
the
when
why
what
and
how
questions
i
could
still
feel
my
body
sweat
and
it
felt
like
my
nose
was
bleeding
but
i
couldnt
move
and
slowly
it
was
like
i
could
feel
the
dmt
move
though
my
body
and
everywhere
it
came
it
killed
me
it
was
cold
i
couldnt
feel
my
arms
at
first
then
i
couldnt
feel
my
legs
and
lastly
i
couldnt
feel
my
heart
and
breathing


coming
up
i
was
alone
in
my
mind
and
there
was
nothing
but
my
thoughts
thoughts
i
thought
must
be
what
death
is
like
am
i
dying
wake
up
please
wake
up
please
wake
up
i
didnt
i
tried
waking
up
for
what
felt
like
an
hour
no
good
did
i
become
my
friends
experiment
did
he
kill
me
no
having
a
corpse
in
his
bed
would
get
him
in
serious
trouble
then
i
must
have
accidentally
took
too
much
yes
thats
it
i
took
too
much
dmt
i
am
the
first
person
dying
on
dmt
what
a
waste
there
is
so
much
i
wanted
to
do
with
life
sure
i
wasnt
always
grateful
for
life
but
did
i
want
to
die
no


hm
whats
that
a
voice
\x93you
idiot
you
are
dying
you
took
too
much
what
would
your
parents
say
there
is
a
girl
in
your
house
expecting
you
to
come
home
tomorrow
and
know
what
youll
never
see
her
again
you
will
never
have
anything
but
your
thoughts

but
i
tried
everything
i
tried
waking
up
lets
give
up
fine
let
this
be
my
end
my
life
would
have
been
brief
but
i
lived
my
life
the
way
i
wanted
to
i
had
a
good
life


the
breakthrough

it
felt
like
my
conscious
was
being
lifted
from
my
dead
body
and
sent
at
light
speed
though
the
universe
i
kept
going
and
going
and
going
for
what
seemed
like
years
and
then
there
was
this
dark
place
and
i
had
no
physical
form
i
was
the
shattering
of
my
ego
thousand
of
pieces
floating
in
space
my
memories
my
feelings
my
ego
i
played
a
piece
of
my
memories
i
relived
it
like
it
was
happening
at
that
very
moment
i
was
a
little
boy
walking
to
my
mother
on
a
sunny
day
i
was
happy
and
wanted
to
be
embraced
with
the
love
of
my
mother
it
felt
like
i
was
starting
to
cry
but
there
was
no
body
to
cry
with
i
relived
moments
of
my
life
my
first
kiss
meeting
my
first
friends
being
bullied
my
first
fight
i
felt
everything

i
started
to
get
control
over
my
shattered
ego
floating
in
space
my
first
thought
was
not
where
am
i
but
when
am
i
i
am
no
believer
of
reincarnation
but
it
felt
like
this
is
where
souls
go
to
wait
for
rebirth
and
i
felt
a
presence
i
felt
he
felt
that
i
could
feel
his
presence
it
felt
like
a
him
not
a
her
i
wanted
to
meet
him
and
instead
of
moving
through
space
space
moved
around
me
and
i
started
going
forward


what
i
encountered
next
was
beautiful
a
floating
ball
of
light
it
was
huge
like
a
red
giant
in
comparison
to
planet
earth
and
it
made
colors
and
shapes
with
its
tentacles
of
light

a
floating
ball
of
light
it
was
huge
like
a
red
giant
in
comparison
to
planet
earth
and
it
made
colors
and
shapes
with
its
tentacles
of
light

millions
of
tentacles
of
light
going
everywhere
i
saw
colors
and
shapes
i
had
never
witnessed
before
it
was
profound
tentacles
started
going
my
way
to
my
shattered
ego
and
when
it
touched
me
i
learned
all
the
secrets
of
existence
imaged
flashed
in
my
head
space
men
alien
gas
colors
murder
sex
tv
propaganda
the
news
pain
and
suffering
technology
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
the
formula
the
math
behind
existence
became
mine
and
i
realized
all
that
is
is
but
perspective
in
an
infinite
large
universe
i
am
god
and
i
am
men
i
am
the
devil
and
i
am
the
saint
all
that
i
see
and
all
that
i
feel
is
but
my
perspective
if
men
and
woman
will
ever
live
together
in
peace
we
must
understand
that
all
that
we
feel
is
but
perspective
our
greatest
enemy
is
our
ignorance
we
kill
and
hurt
because
we
dont
understand
these
people
we
kill
and
hurt
are
not
bad
they
are
different
they
have
a
different
perspective
western
society
has
thought
me
prejudice
has
taught
me
so
called
good
and
wrong
but
they
are
just
one
of
many
perspectives
in
the
universe
and
maybe
just
maybe
no
one
is
right
not
even
me

coming
down
i
started
to
hear
music
and
chanting
i
could
feel
my
body
become
whole
again
and
slowly
i
could
feel
the
sweat
on
my
face
and
the
pain
in
my
lungs
i
opened
my
eyes
and
could
see
the
eyes
on
the
curtain
stare
at
me
i
felt
very
light
and
started
to
speak
\x93water
a
man
sat
next
to
me
he
was
chanting
and
appeared
to
make
a
sign
in
the
air
almost
like
he
was
conjuring
up
magic
his
face
was
covered
in
a
mask
of
light
and
color
it
seemed
familiar
he
gave
me
water
and
kept
chanting
his
long
blond
hair
was
swirling
it
fascinated
me
just
like
his
chanting
and
signs
i
drank
it
felt
good
the
memories
of
my
breakthrough
started
to
come
to
me
i
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
smiled
i
felt
great
i
traveled
and
found
truth
i
could
already
feel
it
changed
me
forever
a
familiar
voice
\x93are
you
ok
how
was
it
he
calmly
asked
i
was
back

after
effects
i
am
one
of
you
a
perspective
in
this
increasingly
mad
and
dangerous
world
but
i
hate
no
longer
hate
is
for
the
unloved
and
the
unnatural




its
a
fairly
sober
and
sunny
sunday
afternoon
in
the
apartment
like
most
any
other
but
in
my
brightest
intentions
and
most
thought
out
plans
ive
something
dark
and
wild
in
store

the
wish
is
to
recreate
the
conditions
of
the
plus
++++
experience
i
had
had
in
the
past
when
i
had
last
successfully
mixed
dmt
and
mescaline

all
attempts
succeeding
that
one\x97wherein
i
manically
thought
\x93my
sensorium
is
a
sun-rapt
field\x97fox
fur
fine
and
silk
sheets
sensual\x97that
im
being
lovingly
dragged
through
by
a
ballistic
missile\x97had
been
frustratingly
lacking
due
to
unpredictable
mimosa
timing
and
effectiveness
or
involuntarily
aborted
in
an
eruption
of
too-soon
green
cactus
barf

reaching
it
again
has
consumed
me
spiritually



but
i
have
it
figured
it
out
now

i
will
eat
far
less
cactus
by
using
syrian
rue
an
herbal
maoi
and
eat
it
slowly
too

then
ill
inject
synthetic
dmt
intramuscularly
thereby
avoiding
the
inconsistencies
of
dmt
digestion
theres
no
fucking
that
up

t+000

after
swallowing
3g
of
ground
syrian
rue
i
begin
the
marathon
pill
eating
session
of
30g
of
dried
green
t
peruvianus
flesh
60
pills
over
and
hour
and
a
half

i
have
done
more
than
this
before
and
it
worked
out
fine

i
begin
to
feel
the
mescaline
about
an
hour
after
swallowing
the
first
cap
of
the
ground
up
flesh

a
half-hour
after
this\x97trying
desperately
to
ignore
the
feeling
by
watching
a
mr
show
dvd\x97i
am
undeniably
nauseous
so
much
so
that
exhaling
at
any
speed
beyond
cautiously
slow
causes
my
stomach
to
rhythmically
spasm


thankfully
i
had
thought
ahead
and
was
keeping
a
plastic
bag
by
my
side
because
there
was
no
way
i
wouldve
made
it
to
the
toilet
in
that
condition

t+200
the
result
of
all
that
work
nausea
and
vomit
is
a
mescaline
buzz
that
i
know
doesnt
have
nearly
the
vital
power
to
provide
the
dmt
with
the
necessary
escape
velocity
to
guide
me
to
that
skyward
realm
of
endlessly
accelerating
beauty
that
the
combos
parabolic
trajectory
rocketed
me
through
before

it
isnt
a
bad
buzz
perhaps
a
low
++
but
it
isnt
enough



i
decide
to
inject
im
3mg
of
2c-e\x97enough
to
prop
up
the
mescaline
launch
pad
without
necessitating
redesign
to
accommodate
its
own
specs
i
think

and
im
right

within
an
hour
i
am
at
a
solid
++
a
warm
and
sensuous
phenethylamine
enclosure
whose
predominantly
emotional
architecture
is
as
predicted
mostly
mescaline-inspired


t+300
i
dissolve
10mg
of
4-aco-dmt
in
juice
and
drink
it
down
im
hoping
to
mimic
a
long
lasting
mimohuasca*


t+400
within
an
hour
of
imbibing
the
4-aco-dmt
the
tripartite
combo
is
humming
along
nicely
though
strangely
still
lacking
in
intensity
despite
taking
the
4-aco-dmt
on
top
of
syrian
rue
it
did
not
feel
like
the
addition
of
a
mimohuasca
high
to
the
established
trip
but
rather
the
combinatory
effects
of
it
with
the
other
two
chemicals
created
a
kind
of
sweet
n
mild
psychedelic
euphoria
entirely
pleasant
in
one
respect
but
falling
far
short
of
the
presumptive
synergistic
potential
of
all
these
psychedelic
titans
in
another
vexing
respect


during
this
hour
i
spend
my
time
priming
my
mind
for
the
dmt
dose
with
images
of
roses

their
aesthetic
is
one
of
fantastically
lush
and
vibrant
bounty

there
is
a
mathematical
elegance
inherent
to
the
most
healthful
forms
of
the
species
that
engages
both
the
cerebral
side
and
the
artistic
heart

it
was
that
mixture
of
precision
and
fecundity
that
embodied
that
last
trip\x97a
deific
scream
of
evermore
quickly
unfurling
reams
of
eidetic
art
projected
directly
into
my
mind
from
the
luminous
visions
of
mad
seraphic
geniuses
the
rose
i
deem
is
my
hopeful
vision
incarnate

now
im
ready
for
the


dmt
**

i
knew
from
a
past
experience
that
50mg
of
dmt
intramuscularly
injected
would
come
on
almost
fully
within
6
minutes
and
by
itself
produce
a
+++
level
of
intensity

though
i
had
combined
mimohuasca
with
small
doses
of
every
psychedelic
involved
in
this
trip
to
good
effect
in
the
past
i
had
never
used
this
specific
combo
before
nor
had
i
ever
used
dmt
intramuscularly
with
a
maoi

i
therefore
decide
to
start
with
25mg



t+500
i
do
so

i
listen
to
a
couple
of
songs
containing
especially
high
levels
of
harmony
and
markedly
florid
compositions
to
further
tune
my
mind
to
the
desired
frequencies

when
theyre
finished
eight
minutes
have
passed

past
experiences
tell
me
i
should
be
peaking
yet
the
trip
is
only
lightly
colored
by
dmt
at
this
point
and
there
are
no
indications
that
the
intensity
is
increasing



t+509
i
inject
the
remaining
25mg

within
three
minutes
the
dmt
increases
in
intensity
six-fold
im
here\x97this
place
that
before
the
great
experience
this
one
hoped
to
model
was
my
conception
of
heaven
a
heterodox
hell
of
endlessly
accelerating
beauty
and
creative
substance
so
great
and
unrelenting
i
cannot
will
myself
from
it
and
thus
can
never
escape
it
but
in
whose
fugacious
beholding
is
inspired
a
tremulous
soul-buckling
gratitude
and
staggering
awe
for
about
a
minute
and
a
half
my
dmt
addition
is
a
success

i
am
precisely
where
i
want
to
be


i
open
my
eyes
but
i
can
hardly
see
a
thing

hot
histemic
tears
bathe
my
face
as
i
fumble
manically
with
my
headphones
***

now
i
want
desperately
to
be
lying
down
and
listening
to
music

i
need
a
rhythm

i
finally
hit
play\x97i
dont
even
know
what
i
will
be
listening
to\x97and
don
my
tear-speckled
headphones
before
collapsing
prostrate
onto
my
mattress
as
soon
as
i
lay
back
a
slippery
gulp
of
hot
watery
mucus
slides
down
my
throat
the
flow
of
mucus
from
here
on
is
constant



t+511
my
throat
is
suddenly
parched
doubtless
a
symptom
of
the
massive
water
draw
this
pseudo-allergic
reaction
is
causing
if
theres
a
cup
of
water
nearby
ill
never
find
it
in
this
condition

i
must
make
it
to
the
bathroom
sink

i
sit
up
in
bed
and
stare
through
cascading
tears
into
the
torrent
of
visuals
before
me

but
this
lachrymose
sight
is
also
a
feeling
one
of
having
gone
too
far

i
am
strongly
disoriented
and
my
head
feels
hot

i
am
the
heat
ripples
radiating
from
the
forehead
that
houses
the
febrile
dream
of
a
blessedly-mad
mental
patient

major
ego-tectonic
activity
being
registered
here
shit
my
psycho-strata
are
shifting
like
alternating
layers
of
clear
hot
oil
and
ice
creating
isolated
bubbles
of
immiscible
thoughts
and
sensations
though
all
transparent
to
each
other
and
growing
evermore
fluid


on
my
way
to
the
bathroom
i
need
to
defend
myself
from
an
ambush
by
my
treacherous
walls
and
open
closet
doors

fuckers
come
at
me
the
three-hundred-and-sixty-first
degree
of
lateral
planer
rotation
which
i
didnt
expect

making
my
defense
is
quite
an
ordeal
because
my
hands
are
still
four
feet
behind
me
but
i
finally
pull
through
and
make
it
to
the
bathroom




with
what
will
be
my
last
fully
successful
effort
at
purposeful
movement
for
over
an
hour
i
fill
a
cup
with
water
at
the
bathroom
sink
and
hastily
gulp
it
down

i
allow
my
shaking
legs
to
buckle
and
i
drop
to
the
floor
soon
my
proprioception
is
shred
to
ribbons
and
thrown
to
a
riot
of
winds
where
it
thrashes
about
violently
in
twisted
currents

i
can
feel
pressures
and
textures
but
cannot
discern
where
they
are
in
relation
to
any
part
of
my
body
so
i
must
deduce
the
positions
of
my
limbs
from
the
pressures
and
textures
they
encounter
and
cross-reference
that
with
my
memory
of
the
layout
and
material
composition
of
my
bathroom
fixtures
i
remain
surprisingly
detached
and
rational


my
limbs
are
so
weak
a
kind
of
strange
mixture
of
numbness
and
exhaustion
seems
to
permeate
their
muscles
i
am
about
to
find
this
feeling
is
a
result
of
neither
of
these
descriptors
but
rather
that
my
limbs
loyalty
to
me
is
surreptitiously
being
relinquished
to
some
mysterious
imperious
menace



suddenly\x97teeth
gritted
and
fists
balled\x97i
am
wrenched
into
the
fetal
position
by
a
spastic
reflex
this
is
accompanied
by
a
viciously
energetic
surge
of
profound
disorientation
and
nausea

my
face
is
soaked
in
tears
and
spattered
by
constant
trickles
and
bursts
of
mucus
from
my
nose
and
mouth

my
hair
and
body
become
soaked
with
sweat
alarmingly
fast



i
will
not
lie
in
my
own
vomit
too



i
feel
out
the
toilet
as
opening
my
eyes
to
find
it
is
futile
and
just
barely
raise
my
head
over
the
bowl

i
look
down
at
the
water
which
appears
to
be
directly
below
me
but
the
proprioceptive
impression
i
receive
from
my
hands
is
that
i
am
actually
too
far
away
to
make
it
into
the
bowl

my
trembling
arms
are
about
to
give
out
and
so
i
must
hook
my
chin
on
the
rim
for
support
before
i
can
vomit
trusting
from
the
pressure
on
my
neck
that
i
am
indeed
over
the
bowl


the
sensation
of
vomiting
is
horrendous
and
unrelenting

i
think
the
retching
has
been
stretched
to
its
most
miserable
limits
and
then
in
a
feat
of
gastrointestinal
contortionism
curling
like
the
fetid
petal-edges
of
a
rotten
flower
my
esophageal
sphincter
suddenly
feels
as
though
it
blows
inside
out

it
comes
with
a
wet
pop
and
a
grotesque
synaesthetic
vision
thats
rancid
to
the
core
infected
by
bilious
colors
and
violently
visceral
dynamism


after
approximately
a
minute
of
this
convulsive
un-breathing
hell
i
fall
back
to
the
floor
and
drop
my
head
onto
a
slippery
dollop
of
snot
i
had
ejected
earlier
and
gasp
for
air
my
lungs
slurping
in
fluid
from
my
throat
and
reflexively
sputtering
out
coughs
in
rapid-fire
succession

this
is
could
be
bad
****
i
know
from
previous
experiences
that
when
its
used
intramuscularly
the
peak
of
dmt
only
lasts
15
minutes
before
a
noticeable
decline
and
im
about
due
to
start
noticing
that
decline

but
it
doesnt
come


another
surge
throttles
me
and
i
fold
inward
clenching
my
gut
while
digging
my
nails
into
my
palms
jesus
whats
happening
to
me

now
my
right
shoulder
is
irresistibly
being
brought
to
the
side
of
my
head
and
my
left
arm
has
been
stretched
at
full
extension
towards
my
hip
all
against
my
will

ive
experience
quite
elaborate
drug-mediated
extra-volitional
body
contortions
or
\x93idiomotor
effects
in
the
past
on
4-aco-dmt
and
2c-e\x97these
effects
have
accompanied
most
of
the
most
rapturous
of
my
psychedelic
experiences\x97but
there
they
were
ordered
purposeful
ecstatic
and
ultimately
resistible
resistible
in
such
a
way
as
one
can
resist
a
yawn

this
experience
though
is
of
being
maliciously
tied
in
knots
to
satisfy
a
sadistic
puppeteer
that
his
power
has
been
indelibly
demonstrated

attempts
to
move
outside
his
dictates
are
met
with
increased
limb
numbness
disorientation
and
nausea




the
surges
are
an
ear
popping
ego-concussing
kind
of
electrochemical
ramp
up
that
turns
every
nerve
terminal
molten
before
finally
subsiding
and
leaving
me
frozen
in
a
state
of
wide-eyed
shock

theyre
mostly
physical
at
least
insofar
as
my
emotional
and
cerebral
reaction
to
them
remains
sober
and
so
during
all
this
despite
their
overwhelming
power
my
thoughts
stay
coherent



i
snap
up
a
quick
deep
breath\x97the
air
is
saturated
with
the
acid-stink
of
vomit\x97and
begin
to
hum

i
hold
and
repeat
the
tone
that
reverberates
most
strongly
in
my
chest
plate

towards
the
end
of
my
breath
i
aspirate
\x93shhh
in
a
progressively
thinning
staccato
rhythm
over
my
tongue-tip
and
through
my
teeth
like
a
diamondbacks
fast-diminishing
rattle

i
need
the
steady
vibration
and
distinct
tactile
sensations
of
this
exercise
to
coil
and
compose
myself
around
i
need
something
constant

this
instinctual
mantra
will
be
with
me
often
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
experience


i
need
to
vomit
again

this
time
its
worse

30
seconds
of
convulsions
are
followed
by
another
30
of
coughing
on
the
floor
after
i
choke
on
fluid
again

i
havent
taken
a
breath
my
eyes
are
closed
yet
even
the
darkness
seems
to
go
in
and
out
of
focus


im
losing
grip
on
even
the
most
basic
concept
of
symmetry

my
mantra
is
silent

if
i
pass
out
now
after
all
this
exertion
continue
convulsing
and
breath
in
vomit
or
significantly
more
fluid
i
could
really
be
in
trouble


worst
of
all
this
is
a
concern
that
i
know
from
these
atypical
circumstances
isnt
something
that
i
can
tell
myself
that
upon
later
sober
reflection
i
will
see
as
just
panic
stricken
and
irrational
this
isnt
just
a
threat
to
my
future
mental
stability
but
to
my
immediate
being
and
mere
existence
*****
then
at
the
crumbling
edge
of
consciousness
another
surge
hits
but
its
accompanied
this
time
by
a
fiercely
mortal
fear
that
savagely
tears
me
from
the
rapidly
sealing
envelope
of
unconsciousness



with
frantic
grasps
i
claw
my
way
over
the
edge
of
oblivion
and
tumble
into
the
field
of
brittle
ontic
shards
that
comprise
the
world

im
breathing
i
regain
my
mantra

but
now
the
fear
lurks
between
breaths

i
consider
shoving
my
fingers
down
my
throat
to
purge
the
remaining
liquid
in
my
stomach
so
it
cant
choke
me
if
i
pass
out
but
i
dont

this
is
now
a
trial

it
is
important
that
i
face
it
as
such



upon
this
determined
thought
my
body
twists
me
over
onto
my
stomach

my
face
is
being
forced
into
the
floor

my
teeth
saw
across
the
tile
in
a
serrated
rhythm
that
reverberates
deep
into
my
jaw

my
arms
and
legs
are
being
irresistibly
stretched
to
their
full
vertical
extensions



\x93what
the
fuck
is
this
i
demand
to
know
out
loud
in
a
tone
that
quavers
between
indignation
and
a
whimper





\x93stop


my
right
hand
is
driven
into
the
outer
edge
of
the
bath
and
cannot
extend
any
farther

at
this
limitation
my
wrist
cramps
painfully
and
im
flooded
with
images
of
deformed
growth

the
visions
impart
that
what
is
happening
is
a
kind
of
egoic
metamorphosis
inextricably
bound
up
with
the
movements
of
my
body
such
that
each
movement
is
a
direct
and
integral
manifestation
of
the
metamorphic
process

staunching
the
flow
of
these
movements
now
will
cause
an
aberration
in
the
assemblage
of
what
will
be
my
reformed
ego

i
give
myself
a
burn
on
my
bathroom
carpet
and
scrape
my
ankle
on
the
unfinished
bottom
of
the
sink
cabinet
while
moving
my
legs
out
of
the
door\x97the
door
that
has
to
be
there
somewhere\x97so
that
they
can
be
fully
extended
but
i
do
it

i
have
to
do
it




this
drug
cant
possibly
last
any
longer
though
i
suspect
im
already
far
past
the
point
when
past
experiences
tell
me
i
should
be
down
and
im
right
this
is
different

but
another
surge
is
nevertheless
working
its
way
up


this
time
the
convulsions
are
harder
and
last
even
longer
when
i
can
open
my
mouth
to
breath
i
immediately
gag
on
the
acrid
air
and
expend
all
received
relief

i
crumple
from
the
toilet
to
the
ground
vomiting
swallowed
mucus
on
the
floor
next
to
me

im
being
held
underwater

my
vision
begins
to
blur
again

this
is
happening
now
questioning
analysis
any
distancing
from
its
demands
is
wholly
impossible
there
is
nothing
else
in
my
mind
i
am
in
my
most
desperate
most
silent
moment


will
i
call
out
to
my
mother
make
a
plea
to
a
past
love
burn
my
last
breath
screaming
for
help
to
any
nearby
neighbors
will
this
hour
of
desperation
culminate
in
a
moment
of
revelation
when
an
anthropomorphized
interventionist
god
at
my
tortured
supplication
bestows
his
mercy
and
delivers
me
from
this
demonic
tryptamines
possession



for
reasons
i
dont
fully
understand
and
at
first
to
my
own
self-estrangement
but
then
with
briefly
stuttering
lonely-but-resolute
allegiance
i
choose
the
forms
of
the
sublime\x97their
being
their
memory
and
their
mere
potential
to
exist
as
abstract
and
impersonal
as
that
sounds\x97as
the
hope
of
my
deliverance




soon
it
is
evident
that
ive
made
the
right
choice



the
pounding
waves
of
distortion
and
caustic
washes
of
physical
misery
begin
slowly
drawing
into
a
whirling
form

at
the
moment
it
is
just
a
glint
the
liminal-edge
of
some
terrible
resplendence
descried
through
the
haze
of
perceptual
bombardment
and
wavering
consciousness
but
the
rose
apotheosized
is
its
manifest
form



those
earlier
images
that
precious
90
seconds
i
can
feel
their
phenomenal
echo
casting
out
from
my
memory

i
can
trace
it
back
to
its
inviolate
source
within
me


i
begin
to
do
just
this
and
in
doing
so
i
come
full
circle
to
the
rose

an
exquisite
crucible
where
these
ragged
tendrils
of
my
psyche
can
be
poured
and
alloyed
recast
with
grafts
from
its
supple
textures
and
re-braided
in
the
whirling
wake
of
its
spiraling
convolutions



for
a
moment
i
revel
in
absolution
but
am
soon
disturbed
by
a
strange
force
hurdling
up
from
below
me

i
am
struck
with
great
urgency
that
this
this
immanent
fusion
of
psychology
and
form
this
ego-entrainment
with
the
sublime
is
far
too
important
to
be
met
passively

with
pain
and
bitter
effort
working
against
the
spastic
compulsions
of
the
dmt
i
roll
flat
onto
my
back
shakily
i
bend
my
arms
at
right
angles
to
the
floor
ball
my
fists
and
focus
on
these
feelings
of
balance
and
symmetry
ive
so
difficultly
wrought

it
is
painful
but
it
is
good

it
is
the
feeling
of
interjecting
marshaled
will
into
a
wild
vicious
conflict
of
forming
the
beginnings
of
a
promising
trialogue
with
my
seditious
body
and
the
scattered
ranks
of
my
subconscious
mind


the
resulting
mixture
of
beauty
and
pain
reined
by
deft
volition
evokes
sensuously
symbolic
images
of
silk
spooling
around
broken
glass
and
shapes
into
mind
graceful
forms
hewn
of
battered
iron


i
reflect
on
why
i
choose
sublimity
as
my
salvation
over
a
personal
god
or
interpersonal
love

it
might
have
something
to
do
with
a
recent
re-scan
of
kants
critique
of
judgment
where
he
speaks
of
the
sublime
as
free
and
transcendent
but
i
think
it
has
much
more
to
do
with
self-determination
because
it
does
not
matter
to
me
that
kants
theories
have
since
fallen
into
some
disrepute

what
matters
to
me
is
that
what
is
most
important
to
me
revealed
by
mortal
fear
as
honest
and
at
the
core
of
my
being
is
a
self-formed
ideal
one
that
i
choose
to
believe\x97its
ontological
status
being
secondary\x97to
be
free
and
transcendent
to
be
unassailable
to
be
non-contingent

and
most
crucially
most
centrally
that
i
have
it
in
my
ability
to
choose
such
an
aspect
of
myself
consciously
and
with
a
total
permeation
of
my
being
it
is
evidence
against
self-doubt
evidence
that
these
thoughts
to
me
are
ultimately
not
mere
self-delusions
and
rationalizations
that
hide
the
fearful
truth
that
environmental
machinations
and
my
own
self-interested
power
schemes
subconsciously
and
fully
define
me
thoughts
that
other
powerful
but
less
weighty
psychedelic
experiences
have
taunted
me
with
in
the
past

it
confirms
that
my
spiritual
proclamations
when
their
content
is
made
phenomenologically
transparent
are
not
devotionally
reducible
to
lip
service
but
are
inextricable
from
what
i
am

my
recent
experiences
in
coming
to
understand
an
active
intelligent
and
quasi-autonomous
subconscious
aspect
of
myself
through
psychedelics
also
makes
me
wonder
to
what
degree
this
aspect
might
be
implicated
in
this
experience

the
way
this
experience
has
unfolded
is
a
little
too
tight\x97and
punctuated
by
too
many
strange
and
idiosyncratic
happenings
things
seem
in
ways
plotted
to
fall
together


i
think
not
that
this
is
mere
grasping
for
sense
in
the
wake
of
a
senseless
trauma
but
that
perhaps
i
was
never
in
real
danger
and
the
central
proceedings
of
the
trip
unfolded
as
they
did
though
a
purposeful
subconscious
mediation



its
as
though
that
subconscious
self
with
understanding
has
seized
this
opportunity
to
temper
my
conscious
mind
in
mortal
fear
and
through
this
fundamental
life
experience
it
brings
to
full
awareness
a
deeper
order
within
myself
and
thus
expands
the
scope
of
my
self-awareness
its
happened
to
erase
self-doubt
and
to
bring
my
conscious
self
more
fully
in
league
with
my
deepest
passions

this
process
serves
to
bring
about
a
self-determined
spiritual
evolution
an
evolution
effectively
expedited
through
the
unique
properties
of
psychedelic
drugs

if
this
sort
of
radically
accelerated
subconsciously
mediated
spiritual
evolution
really
occurs
it
just
has

by
the
end
of
these
reflections
the
dmt
has
faded
in
intensity
enough
for
me
to
walk

visuals
are
still
swirling
around
my
alarm
clock
as
i
verify
that
it
has
been
over
one-and-a-half
hours
since
i
injected
the
dmt
it
didnt
just
seem
longer

when
i
drink
ayahuasca\x97as
opposed
to
dehydrating
and
encapsulating
it\x97the
trip
will
usually
last
about
50
minutes
so
for
intramuscularly
injected
dmt
to
last
this
long
with
or
without
an
maoi
is
exceptional
its
another
half
hour
before
the
dmt
fades
into
relative
insignificance
bringing
the
total
time
of
its
influence
to
over
two
hours

the
trip
from
the
other
drugs
has
been
extremely
blunted
by
its
comparative
timidity
to
the
dmt
and
by
my
own
exhaustion
moreover
i
am
simply
reluctant
to
endure
them

i
go
into
a
dreamless
sleep
and
when
i
wake
up
a
couple
of
hours
later
i
feel
only
a
slight
afterglow


though
i
am
excited
by
the
potential
implications
of
this
experience
my
life
has
not
greatly
changed
i
am
grateful
for
the
long-needed
humbling
but
long
ago
i
reached
the
essential
limits
of
what
the
perspectives
afforded
to
me
by
psychedelics
could
do
to
correct
my
overt
flaws
and
improve
my
life
\x93out
in
the
world

the
majority
of
my
best
experiences
with
them
have
nevertheless
and
counter
intuitively
occurred
after
this
realization

the
value
of
these
latter
trips
is
only
made
apparent
to
me
deep
in
thought
and
in
certain
charged
moments
that
vibrate
with
impossible
vigor
and
affirmation
quiet
quakes
whose
bottomless
faults
i
know
now
to
open
through
my
core

these
most
elevated
moments
require
no
justification
they
are
free
and
transcendent
and
i
choose
them

*
the
problem
with
intramuscular
dmt
is
that
its
so
damned
short
for
me
it
will
last
only
40
minutes
start
to
finish
or
so
i
figure
from
past
experiences
absent
syrian
rue
that
is
in
the
experience
i
was
modeling
this
one
after
i
had
used
a
boiled-down-to-powder-and-encapsulated
mimosa
extract

the
result
was
two
and
a
half
hours
of
dmt
powered
bliss
i
wanted
to
emulate
that

a
past
experience
with
syrian
rue
and
4-aco-dmt
had
been
remarkably
similar
to
the
effects
of
the
just
mentioned
mimohuasca
form
which
for
me
is
slower
and
smoother
in
effect
than
its
liquid
form
and
so
that
is
why
i
used
it
here

**i
am
fully
aware
of
the
perceived
futility
a
justified
perception
of
trying
to
recreate
a
++++
experience
by
deferring
to
exacting
mimetic
practices
nevertheless
three
of
my
six
++++
experiences
in
a
decade
of
psychedelics
use
have
occurred
in
the
past
10
months
and
this
recent
\x93rapture-proneness
makes
the
idea
that
the
state
can
be
significantly
affected
in
me
through
these
means
seem
more
probable

***that
this
is
a
histamine
reaction
is
unknown
but
i
simply
dont
know
what
else
would
mediate
a
reaction
like
this

****even
despite
the
numerous
psychedelic
elements
in
play
during
the
trip
i
believe
the
overwhelming
reaction
i
had
was
due
almost
entirely
to
the
syrian
rue
and
intramuscularly
injected
dmt

the
only
drug
in
the
mix
i
have
not
combined
mimohuasca
with
is
4-aco-dmt
though
i
have
used
it
with
mushrooms
which
are
of
course
closely
related
chemically



in
fact
ive
even
combined
mimohuasca
at
a
+++
level
the
same
level
50mg
dmt
im
without
an
maoi
takes
me
to
with
peruvian
torch
and
2c-e
in
the
past
as
well
as
these
latter
two
with
4-aco-dmt
all
without
troubles
giving
me
confidence
it
the
relative
safety
of
their
combination
here

more
strange
still
is
the
delayed
reaction
of
the
dmt

i
had
used
50mg
doses
of
dmt
im
alone
twice
prior
to
this
excursion
and
both
times
i
was
peaked
in
a
lucid
and
manageable
trip
in
less
than
6
minutes
and
completely
down
by
the
40-minute
mark

yet
at
8
minutes
into
this
trip
i
barely
even
felt
the
first
25-milligram
make-sure-the-maoi-doesnt-intensify-it-that-much
dose



also
my
impression
was
that
mao
levels
in
the
blood
were
not
so
concentrated
that
their
inhibition
would
cause
a
profound
increase
in
the
intensity
and
duration
of
an
im
dose
my
hardly
affected
experiences
with
im
dpt\x97which
is
quite
susceptible
to
an
maoi
orally\x97in
conjunction
with
syrian
rue
certainly
support
this
impression
its
abundantly
clear
now
that
even
though
i
think
i
know
my
bodys
reactions
to
drugs
based
on
numerous
past
experiences
and
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
most
all
of
the
drugs
involved
at
the
small
dosages
taken
are
fairly
safe
when
dealing
with
powerful
psychedelics
no
amount
of
precaution
and
past
experience
can
truly
guarantee
safe
passage

*****im
fairly
certain
that
the
dmt
isnt
doing
any
metabolic
damage
here
directly
but
i
never
expected
and
never
read
of
such
violent
or
bizarre
physical
symptoms

death
or
lasting
harm
affected
by
lack
of
oxygen
from
choking
while
unconscious
or
from
some
fatal
idiosyncratic
or
unforeseen
contraindicative
reaction
didnt
and
doesnt
seem
out

the
question

background
information



in
the
realm
of
substance
experimentation
i
consider
myself
something
of
a
seasoned
veteran

i
have
extensive
experience
with
stimulants
dissociatives
opioids
opiates
benzodiazepines
tryptamines
and
phenethylamines

many
of
my
experiences
involve
research
chemicals
and
unique
combinations
of
substances

i
particularly
enjoy
the
exploration
of
combining
multiple
substances
to
see
what
synergistic
or
conflicting
effects
result

i
particularly
enjoy
the
exploration
of
combining
multiple
substances
to
see
what
synergistic
or
conflicting
effects

i
think
cocktails
of
chemicals
can
often
yield
the
most
rewarding
experiences
when
crafted
with
care
and
intent


i
take
5000
iu
of
vitamin
d3
daily
along
with
2400
mg
of
mesalamine
for
a
lifelong
stomach
condition
i
do
not
consider
either
of
these
to
be
a
contributor
factor
in
this
experience



all
of
the
dosages
in
this
report
were
prepared
on
a
freshly
calibrated
000
mg
scale

the
materials
were
sourced
from
a
vetted
chemist
and
tested
using
several
reagents

i
am
confident
the
substances
were
indeed
racemic
ketamine
and
dmt
and
that
their
purity
was
true

i
chose
to
use
racemic
ketamine
rather
than
esketamine
because
i
was
hoping
to
maximize
the
sedative
effects
i
find
racemic
provides
me

esketamine
can
be
a
bit
more
sparkly
and
zippy
at
times

for
me
esketamine
is
more
similar
to
dmt
and
most
tryptamines
in
general
than
racemic
ketamine

i
wanted
to
pull
myself
in
a
different
direction
to
produce
a
slightly
wider
array
of
sensations

the
entirety
of
the
experience
in
the
report
below
was
spent
in
the
company
of
two
close
friends
iroh
and
bodhi
as
well
as
my
trusty
dog
gee

we
spent
the
evening
in
my
home
with
comfortable
lighting
and
soothing
incense

we
covered
the
floor
of
the
living
room
in
pillows
and
blankets
to
maximize
our
comfort

the
set
and
setting
were
absolutely
prime
for
an
intense
experience
i
had
responsible
and


able

experienced
sitters
in
a
controlled
and
optimized
space

a
combination
of
personally
written
notes
audio
recordings
and
notes
from
iroh
and
bodhi
were
used
in
the
creation
of
this
report
i
am
confident
that
the
timestamps
are
accurate
to
within
+-
5
seconds

given
the
short
duration
relative
to
other
substances
and
experiences
of
the
peak
of
this
experience
i
employed
extra
care
to
include
seconds
in
some
of
my
timestamps
in
order
to
provide
readers
with
as
much
data
as
possible

i
have
tried
this
combination
several
time
before
but
never
in
such
a
controlled
environment
or
with
the
intent
of
writing
a
full
report

i
have
found
dmt
glass
vape
setups
such
as
a
the
machine
awkward
to
handle
when
intoxicated
on
ketamine

changa
has
been
by
far
my
most
memorable
way
to
experience
the
combination
of
dmt
and
ketamine

my
past
dozen
or
more
dmt
experiences
have
been
using
a
digital
volcano
vaporizer


i
use
this
in
the
experience
described
below
as
well
and
found
it
very
manageable
and
effective

i
did
retrofit
the
volcano
with
an
oversized
bag
to
minimize
the
number
of
\x93bag
refills
required

the
volcano
was
set
at
426
fahrenheit
degrees

tolerance
was
a
complete
non

on
the
day
of

i
generally
like
to
dip
my
toe
in
the
water
before
i
continue
with
medium
or
high
dosages
of
ketamine

i
find
this
allows
me
to
mentally
adjust
and
become
comfortable
with
the
movement
into
a
different
mental
space

correspondingly
i
begin
the
evening
with
the
preparation
and
insufflation
of
35
mg
of
racemic
ketamine

there
is
almost
no
sting
in
my
nostril
but
as
i
begin
to
prepare
my
dmt
dosage
a
tangy
chemical
flavor
makes
its
way
to
my
palate
via
the
slow
but
steady
drip
that
has
developed
after
a
few
minutes

i
have
prepped
the

chamber
of
the
volcano
with
a
new
metal
pad

on

surface
i
deposit
a
freshly

of

not
crushed

processed
the
material
in
any
way
as
it
is
relatively
fine
already

normally
i
aim
to
conserve
energy
whenever
possible
but
tonight
i
give
myself
the
leniency
of
preheating
the
volcano
to
426
fahrenheit
degrees
and
maintain
this
temperature

i
want
the

dosage
available
whenever

in

flush
my

the

inability
to
land
the
water
from
the
faucet
into
the
glass
on
the
first
try

i
dont
wipe
up
my
small
spill

instead
i
mechanically
walk
back
to
bodhi
and
iroh
with
the
giggle
transforming
to
a
grin

the
numbness
in
my
legs
makes
walking
feel
foreign

although
unfamiliar
i
enjoy
the
way
that
i
am
forced
to
pay
attention
to
the
action
of
raising
and
lowering
each
leg
as
i
walk

im
especially
aware
of
how
my
body
connects
to
itself

normally
i
think
of
walking

in
regards
to
my
feet
doing
all
the
work

now
however
strides
are
felt
in
the
originating
muscles
my
hips
quadriceps
and
glutes

after
reaching
my
destination
i
close
my
eyes
as
a
way
to
check
my
condition

within
a
second
vivid
cartoons
of
random
animals
backed
by
rotating
geometrical
patterns
spring
to
life
across
my
entire
minds
eye

the
visions
come
of
rapidly
brightness
of
colors
and
the
calmness

as
a
set
these
are
a
sign
that
i
am
tripping
heavily

ive
done
as
planned
gone
deep
into
the
land
of
dissociation

the
effects
continue
to
rise
but
i
have
the
feeling
that
i
am
nearing
a
peak
and
plateau

nothing
from
my
measurable
senses
alludes
to
this

it
is
an
instinctual
notion
likely
due
to
my
familiarity
with
my
body
and
how
it
reacts
to
this
substance

am
past

on
the
shulgin
rating

this
is
about
the
point
in
the
experience
that
i
anticipated
introducing
tryptamines
to
my
system

environment
is
comfortable

i
feel
ready

familiar
butterflies
flap
their
wings
in
my
stomach
as
i
make
my

to
the
floor
in

rearrange
a

so
i
can
lie
backwards
and
be
supported
in

relatively
upright
and

position

attached

turn
on
the
air
flow
and
watch
the
machine

i
am
waiting
to
see
the
first
wisps
of
smoke
emerge

this
method
is
intended
to
provide
the
most
concentrated
smoke
possible
by
not
filling
the
bag
with
forced
air
before
the
crystal
material
begins
to
vaporize

after
about
three
seconds
the
slightest
swirls
of
white
smoke
emerge
from
the
base

i
immediately
connect
the
bag
and
watch
milky
white
smoke
fill
the
plastic
receptacle

the
bag
crinkles
loudly
as
i
stare
at
it
with
intensity

am
acutely
aware
of
the
severity
of
my
next

at

myself
one

raise
the

to
my
mouth

inhale
slowly
and
deeply

draw
in

my

are
stuffed
full

i
count
to
ten

my
fingers
to

me
be
honest
and
accurate

the
smoke
is
arid
drying
out
my
insides

this
aligns
with
the
smell
of
the
substance
pungent
and
singeing
reminding
me
of
a
cross
between
the
scent
of
opening
a
new
can
of
tennis

the
stench
of
burning

my

become
light
and
its
interior
begin
to
swell
and
stretch

a
gentle
low
pitched
tinnitus
type
hum
resonates
through
my
eardrums

i
am
completely
focused
on
the
smoking
process

the

breathing

complicated

as
though
every

in

grand
crescendo

into

my
mind
personality
being

whatever
one
wants
to
call

people
reference
as

begins
a
process
of

i
exhale
without
checking
my
fingers
for
the
ten
second
count

it
just
seems
like
time
to
breath
some
air
again

after
a
few
deep
breaths
i
raise
the
bag
to
my
lips
once
again

all
of
the
colors
in
my
vision
are
saturated

besides
being
more
intense
than
usual
their
intensity
pulses
slightly

where
colors
clash
at
the
edges
of
objects
there
is
a
bold
black
line
that
encases
a
finer
white
line

this
accentuates
everything
i
see
and
makes
an
environment
i
am
very
familiar
with
seem
new
and
unusual

normally
this
level
of
visuals
and
the
speed
at
which
i
am
moving
away
from
sobriety
would
make
me
think
about
pausing
my
dmt
intake

i
seem
to
have
an
easier
time
accepting
the
change
in
headspace
while
departing
from
a
++
condition
from
the
ketamine
than
from
a
sober
baseline

counting
is
difficult

my
arms
droop
from
my
crossed
legs
to
the
floor

i
direct
my
gaze
to
my
fingers
to
see
if
they
can
help
me
achieve
my
one
through
ten

looking
down
i
am
shook
by
the
lack
of
depth
perception

my
veins
are
visible
on
the
surface
of
my
arms

they
are
also
on
the
floor

wait
im
confused
i
cant
see
where
my
arms
end
and
the
rug
begins

i
almost
cant
reconcile
what
im
seeing

my
hands
which
i
know
to
exist
in
the
space
i
am
looking
at
are
simply
not
registering
with
my
mind

there
are
patterns
moving
across
everything

my
focus
zooms
in
slightly
before
immediately
retreating

this
all
couples
with
the
breathing
slight
rising
and
falling
that
is
occurring
in
the
\x93rug
arms
area
of
my
vision

the
end
result
is
me
giving
up
on
trying
to
count
with
my
fingers
because
they
dont
seem
to
exist
anywhere
in
my
visual
field

suddenly
things
reverse
my
hands
and
arms
pop
off
the
suddenly
2-d
background

they
look
like
the
vision
tests
that
optometrists
give
using
the
cards
and
glasses
to
check
depth
perception
and
color
blindness

my
arms
stand
out
in
a
goofy
almost
synthetic
manner
like
early
3-d
movies

my
skin
looks
sickly
blotchy
with
patches
of
various
tan
colors
shifting
around

my
vision
zooms
in
on
them
or
they
breath
upwards
towards
me
i
cant
tell
which

the
sensation
is
like
i
am
opening
my
eyes
as
wide
as
possible
while
intently
focusing
on
my
arm
as
i
lower
my
head
closer
to
my
skin

i
know
my
head
is
not
actually
moving
the
effect
is
only
happening
within
my
mind

the
whine
of
my
tinnitus
cranks
higher
and
louder

i
have
some
slight
trepidation
about
how
intense
this
might
get

i
consciously
tell
myself
that
now
is
the
point
to
begin
letting
go
and
giving
into
the
experience
that
i
have
brought
upon
myself

holding
on
here
could
cause
things
to
go
drastically
awry

my
eyes
are
closed
as
i
inhale
and
hold
in
the
last
of
the
smoke
contained
in
the
bag

i
am
no
longer
actively
counting
the
seconds
but
i
am
dialed
into
the
passage
of
time

the
time
arrives
and
i
open
my
eyes
as
i
blow
outwards

expecting
the
world
to
be
breaking
apart
into
brightly
colored
fractals
and
patterns
i
am
taken
aback
at
the
relatively
benign
version
of
reality
i
find
in
front
of
me

i
am
beyond
the
physical
and
mental
capability
of
re-filling
the
bag
to
see
if
any
of
my
dosage
remains
unvaporized

iroh
takes
over
the
process
and
decides
to
leave
me
undisturbed
as
the
re-filled
bag
is
nearly
100%
clear
meaning
i
received
the
entirety
of
the
desired
dosage

i
dont
slump
back
into
my
pillows
as
i
expected

the
atomic
vibration
going
on
inside
me
slows
rapidly

i
have
no
desire
to
move
my
gaze
around
the
room

this
journey
is
for
me
very
internal
i
forget
iroh
and
bodhi
are
here
with
me

my
mind
is
separating
from
the
room

it
is
also
branching
away
from
its
typical
one-pieced
existence

i
do
a
mental
scan
to
check
my
condition

well
i
tried
to
do
so
anyways

about
halfway
through
asking
myself
\x93how
are
you
doing
anatoli

anything
to
be
concerned
about

the
thought
dissipates

im
no
longer
thinking
or
capable
of
thinking
in
a
standard
manner

im
100%
a
spectator
in
the
increasingly
foreign
space
i
exist
in

my
mind
like
my
body
is
eerily
still
devoid
of
all
movement

there
is
none
of
the
mental
hyperspace
travel
that
i
typically
associate
with
entry
to
a
dmt
experience

i
had
intentions
to
keep
my
eyes
open
as
long
as
possible
to
enjoy
and
document
the
visuals
brought
on
by
the
substances


as
is
typical
for
me
however
i
feel
most
comfortable
with
my
eyes
closed
as
the
tryptamine
comes
on

my
brain
tingles
and
an
infinitely
complex
maze
of
mental
pathways
spark
to
life
with
electrical
zips

body

seated
on
my
pillows
eyes
open
now
staring
blankly
into
the
kitchen

perspective
angles
size
and
comprehension
are
distorting
massively

i
am
processing
the
objects
in
the
room
in
a
minimalist
fashion
that
is
absolute
in
its
simplicity

my
thoughts
flow

stove

that
is
a
stove
cabinet

those
things
are
cabinets
dishwasher

that
is
a
dishwasher
stool

that
is
a
stool
why
are
the
counters
crooked
how
is
the
dishwasher
taller
than
the
counters
that
sit
on
top
of
it

i
ponder
similar
questions
as
the
items
in
my
kitchen
continues
to
change
size

i
never
see
them
change
there
is
no
shrinking
growing
or
breathing
the
objects
seem
to
change
shape
while
my
mind
focuses
on
other
pieces
of
my
vision
only
when
i
pass
visual
focus
over
them
again
am
i
able
to
see
that
they
have
shrunk
or
grown

the
air
is
charged
with
a
sort
of
electricity
my
vision
is
crunchy
and
unsaturated

the
visual
static
begins
to
fizzle
and
crackle

it
as
if
the
central
point
of
my
visual
field
is
the
starting
point
for
picasso
and
he
has
chosen
to
move
outward
from
this
point
of
origin
pushing
my
vision
into
small
rectangular
smudges
each
roughly
2-4
inches
in
size

the
abstract
adjustment
to
my
visual
field
mimics
but
distorts
what
i
know
is
in
front
of
my
eyes

the
oven
is
overtaken
by
silver
and
black
squares
the
floor
and
cabinets
become
brown
and
tan
squares

each
square
has
the
texture
of
thick
acrylic
paint
that
has
been
moved
roughly
across
canvas
with
a
thick
brush
distinguishable
from
its
neighbor
by
the
patterning
that
results
from
the
direction
of
the
brush
stroke

about
half
of
my
vision
has
transitioned
from
\x93reality
and
the
objects
i
know
are
in
the
room
to
the
imprecise
pointillistic
square
smudges

the
square
shapes
begin
relatively
abstract
but
they
are
rapidly
morphing
into
increasingly
perfect
angular
square
shapes

at
the
beginning
of
this
visual
display
it
was
distinctly
tryptamine
in
nature

as
it
develops
the
characteristics
seem
to
draw
from
the
ketamine
more

bright
matte
white
lines
seemingly
their
own
light
source
appear
out
of
thin
air

they
begin
to
wrap
around
the
outlines
of
the
tiny
squares
that
have
blotched
up
my
vision

the
shapes
are
perfectly
geometrically
aligned
now
and
the
white
strings
of
light
double
back
on
themselves
creating
cubes
in
the
place
of
squares

the
cubes
sync
into
formation
taking
the
shape
of
an
ocean
wave

even
in
my
intoxicated
condition
i
realize
the
true
phenomenality
of
this
\x93visual

the
wave
curves
smoothly
a
full
three
dimensional
demonstration
of
oceanic
shape
swirling
through
the
air
in
my
kitchen

after
rolling
forwards
reaching
though
the
air
towards
me
the
wave
crests
breaks
and
shatters
into
small
cubes
that
rattle
geometrically
through
the
air

the
luminous
lines
collide
and
overlap

smaller
cubes
are
created
in
the
turmoil

they
then
tumble
in
their
own
directions
spinning
as
they
go

as
with
normal
waves
some
parts
of
the
spray
are
more
turbulent
than
others

these
areas
become
brilliantly
complex
infinite
patterns
crisscrossing
in
all
three
dimensions

the
crashing
wave
has
run
its
course

some
boxes
disappear
while
others
slow
their
tumbling
and
spinning
but
remain
slowly
drifting
in
the
air

the
white
lines
become
very
bright

i
can
focus
on
nothing
but
them
and
their
compounding
intensity
their
glow
surging
stronger
and
stronger
like
a
neon
light
on
the
fritz

with
a
final
culmination
flash

brilliant
white
light
overtakes
my
entire
visual
field

the
white
is
brightest
in
the
center
and
darkens
gradually
towards
the
edges
of
my
vision

the
dominant
white
fades
over
a
period
of
about
a
second
and
a
half

although
the
room
has
not
changed
in
the
wake
of
the
completely
unpigmented
moment
it
feels
like
i
am
viewing
it
for
the
first
time

it
is
fresh
new
and
unfamiliar

the
entire
wave
visual
last
perhaps
4-6
seconds

although
this
is
a
short
period
of
time
i
was
able
to
comprehend
and
retain
an
unbelievable
amount
of
detail

sound
returns
to
my
ears
slowly

the
dazzling
display
has
been
silent

my
attention
has
been
100%
on
the
witnessing
and
interpretation
of
the
things
i
have
been
witnessing

gentle
murmur
eases
me
back
into
awareness

i
have
been
entirely
stoic
since
setting
down
the
volcano
bag

i
break
the
stillness
with
a
small
smile
and
turn
of
the
head

i
am
able
to
formulate
thoughts
now

i
begin
to
think
of
how
to
describe
what
just
happened

i
dont
write
any
notes
or
speak
anything
to
assist
myself
via
audio
recording

sometimes
i
am
afraid
during
an
experience
that
i
will
forget
the
details
feelings
or
sensations

in
this
moment
however
i
know
there
will
not
be
a
problem
with
recall

this
is
a
calming
thought
that
allows
me
to
not
fight
to
stay
connected
to
any
sort
of
\x93reality
or
commit
things
to
memory

i
am
still
at
a
+++
level
on
the
shulgin
rating
scale
at
this
point
and
have
been
for
a
few
minutes

the
visuals
are
immersive
and
intensive
enough
to
justify
this
rating

my
gaze
stays
attracted
to
the
kitchen

there
is
less
shapeshifting
trickery
in
my
visual
field
now

instead
there
is
an
interaction
happening
between
my
thoughts
and
specific
items
in
front
of
me

i
can
see
the
entirety
of
the
room
in
focus
but
all
my
attention
is
centered
on
just
two
objects

i
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
my
focus
and
thoughts
are
drawn
directly
to
the
legs
of
a
stool
about
ten
feet
in
front
of
me
as
well
as
to
the
stove
once
again
which
sits
about
twenty
feet
from
me

the
choice
objects
shine
and
shimmer
almost
highlighted
brighter
than
anything
else

besides
this
glow
some
relatively
mellow
visual
static
and
increased
saturation
the
stove
and
stool
look
pretty
normal

at
this
point
the
ketamine
seems
to
be
controlling
the
visuals

at
this
point
the
ketamine
seems
to
be
controlling
the
visuals


there
is
almost
no
patterning
in
my
vision
something
i
typically
get
on
any
dosage
of
dmt

i
can
feel
the
presence
of
the
dmt
in
my
thoughts
and
physical
brain

a
pleasant
pressure
works
from
the
surface
of
my
skull
downwards
into
my
the
center
of
my
brain

my
braincase
sizzles

this
sensation
is
more
enjoyable
than
similar
feelings
during
my
average
dmt-only
experiences
not
combination
experiences
due
to
the
fact
that
the
sizzling
brain
matter
is
steeped
in
the
swirling
sedation
brought
on
by
the
ketamine

i
have
cognizant
thoughts

why
are
these
items
stool
and
stove
so
important

are
they
significant
or
just
visually
stimulating

am
i
looking
too
far
into
this

maybe
im
just
high

this
type
of
basic
analysis
is
happening
in
my
mind

at
the
same
time
however
i
feel
like
it
is
not
really
\x93me
having
these
thoughts
because
i
also
am
dedicating
100%
of
my
attention
to
soaking
in
what
my
eyes
are
witnessing

additionally
i
have
an
internal
dialogue
a
running
manuscript
of
what
i
will
later
write
in
my
report

on
top
of
all
these
trains
of
thought
i
am
somehow
comprehending
the
division
itself
of
my
being
into
multiple
points
of
view

i
have
been
existing
in
multiple
pieces
for
a
few
minutes
at
least
now
but
i
am
finally
realizing
the
reality
splitting
for
what
it
truly
is
multiple
perspectives
being
perceived
simultaneously
in
equal
detail
and
functionality

i
feel
like
the
sun
is
rising
for
the
first
time
in
my
world



as
though
i
have
figured
out
something
completely
revolutionary
and
amazing

the
cut
and
dry
logical
thought
processing
from
the
ketamine
seems
to
be
joined
flawlessly
with
the
other-worldly
enlightened
and
shimmering
mental
condition
of
the
dmt

i
am
holding
onto
the
rapid
thoughts
much
better
than
i
would
on
dmt
alone

sometimes
thoughts
and
visions
fly
past
in
incomprehensible
randomness
at
breakneck
speed
like
a
deck
of
cards
being
shuffled

tonight
my
mental
deck
of
cards
is
in
the
hands
of
a
magician
rather
than
a
casino
dealer

the
following
slices
of
reality
are
processed
and
felt
at
the
same
exact
time

sometimes
in
normal
life
i
find
myself
multi-tasking
thinking
about
one
subject
while
performing
another
task

in
my
current
state
none
of
the
variations
of
reality
take
even
a
slight
backseat
as
would
normally
be
the
case

i
seem
to
possess
extra
mental
capacity
allowing
faster
processing
of
my
multiple
minds

my
minds





1
the
actual
visual
field
in
front
of
me
what
i
am
physically
seeing





2
the
mental
activity
that
is
wondering
\x93why
does
this
stool
and
stove
stand
out





3
how
am
i
going
to
describe
the
separation
of
these
\x93versions
of
my
mind
to
others
after
the
experience





4
a
stream
of
thought
trying
to
process
the
idea
of
these
multiple
realities

the
open
eyed
visuals
are
beginning
to
change
the
stool
and
stove
become
less
important

my
eyes
are
closing
slowly

before
they
shut
my
vision
goes
through
some
reformatting

everything
fades
to
completely
black
over
about
a
second
i
know
my
eyes
are
still
open
as
i
can
feel
them
physically
in
such
a
position

in
my
black
field
of
vision
a
singular
point
of
white
light
appears

the
shape
is
drawn
from
a
single
dot
in
the
darkness
that
seems
to
be
roughly
ten
feet
from
me

the
speck
of
glistening
white
grows
and
stretches
bending
until
it
returns
to
itself
and
forms
an
absolutely
perfect
square

the
lonely
square
sprouts
an
offshoot
from
the
upper
left
corner
which
develops
into
a
second
square

this
second
square
shoots
out
a
white
line
from
each
of
its
upper
corners
and
these
both
become
squares
of
their
own

rinse
repeat

rapidly
multiplying
squares
shower
my
vision
as
they
explode
in
every
direction
left
right
up
down
and
then
suddenly
backwards
and
forwards
erupting
into
three
dimensions

all
of
this
occurs
initiation
to
culmination
in
the
last
few
seconds
it
takes
for
my
eyelids
to
shut
completely

my
multitude
of
mindspaces
is
beginning
to
dwindle

the
mind
that
is
thinking
about
report
writing
makes
a
note
that
i
dont
have
any
sensations
in
my
body

i
can
register
that
it
is
still
seated
in
the
position
i
last
remember
it
being
after
my
final
exhale
of
dmt

there
is
a
slight
vibration
happening
where
my
flesh
touches
the
ground
but
this
is
barely
detectable

i
am
separated
from
my
flesh
carriage

my
body
is
not
playing
an
important
role
in
the
experience
at
this
point

as
my
eyelids
fall
completely
shut
i
see
utter
blackness
that
lacks
any
definable
depth

there
is
not
a
sense
of
the
darkness
enclosing
me
in
a
claustrophobic
way
like
can
happen
to
me
in
floatation
tanks
or
in
actually
enclosed
spaces
such
as
an
mri
machine

there
is
no
infinite
depth
either
no
sense
of
a
galaxy
expanding
outwards
in
front
of
me

i
see
the
outline
of
a
bone

perhaps
a
femur

it
is
very
generic
like
a
halloween
costume

the
outline
is
a
dull
white

similar
in
intensity
but
drastically
less
shimmering
than
the
wave
of
cubes

the
single
bone
bursts
upwards
and
leftwards
multiplying
as
it
moves
across
the
darkness

the
effect
is
very
similar
to
the
deck
of
cards
that
repeatedly
bounces
downward
after
winning
solitaire
on
an
old
computer

the
bones
move
at
about
half
that
pace
however

i
register
perhaps
twenty
duplicates
that
move
in
a
singular
arc

after
roughly
three
seconds
they
transform

the
bones
skip
from
an
old
school
computer
graphic
to
something
beyond
todays
most
advanced
visual
technology

each
of
the
twenty
odd
shapes
break
out
into
three
dimensions

in
a
split
second
a
simplistic
series
of
lines
generates
an
incomprehensible
number
of
coordinated
objects
like
a
flock
of
sparrows
or
school
of
fish
moving
in
a
way
that
makes
the
group
of
individuals
appear
to
be
a
single
item

the
crowd
expands
in
each
cardinal
direction

while
the
sheer
mass
and
complexity
boggles
my
mind
the
section
of
the
group
that
is
shooting
towards
me
holds
my
attention
more
than
any
other

the
shapes
remain
2-d
despite
their
worldly
movement

the
result
is
like
an
infinite
mirrors
display
that
allows
the
white
lines
to
overlap
with
their
predecessors

each
outlines
reaches
closer
and
closer
to
me
until
all
i
can
see
is
black
and
white
singular
bones
intersections
negative
space
series
of
shapes

all
of
these
hold
my
attention
utilizing
my
multiple
mind
capabilities
seemingly
at
the
same
time

patterns
abstract
forms
and
the
original
multiplied
bone
design
are
all
mentally
ingested
at
once

the
riot
of
shapes
lasts
about
two
seconds
in
my
own
interpretation
of
time

an
impossibly
short
amount
of
time
to
have
taken
in
the
amount
of
detail
i
did

i
have
the
sensation
of
lapsing
out
of
time
and
consciousness

this
comes
to
me
as
it
might
when
i
emerge
from
hypnopompia
after
an
alcoholic
blackout

rather
than
time
being
stretched
out
i
seem
to
have
been
disconnected
from
it
entirely

i
am
roused
from
the
trance
i
didnt
know
i
had
fallen
into
by
a
repetitive
mechanical
clicking
sound

each
clicky
noise
is
tied
connected
by
my
brain
somehow
to
stubby
bone
shapes
that
are
now
raining
down
around
me

the
two
dimensional
outlines
no
longer
have
a
source

they
drop
from
above
and
fall
to
below

no
pile
is
formed
on
the
ground

instead
they
pass
through
the
bottom
of
my
visual
field

the
white
shapes
that
are
closest
to
me
are
much
smaller
than
i
those
seen
from
far
away

the
ones
falling
directly
around
me
are
tiny
the
size
of
raindrops

i
can
feel
these
like
small
in
pinpricks
as
each
bone
contacts
my
body

each
produces
a
sound
like
a
peaceful
typewriter
being
plinked
in
an
adjourning
room

both
the
sound
and
the
physical
sensation
is
pleasurable
relaxing
and
natural

while
the
bones
rain
down
my
point
of
view
is
an
odd
mix
of
first
person
and
just
out
of
body

i
see
a
very
realistic
rendition
of
myself
seated
in
the
exact
position
i
truly
am

so
vivid
was
this
visualization
i
thought
for
a
moment
my
eyes
were
back
open

i
am
not
watching
from
above
but
rather
from
about
a
foot
above
my
right
shoulder

most
of
what
i
see
is
parts
of
my
body
that
would
be
in
view
from
a
first
person
angle

i
can
also
see
my
upper
back
and
a
small
bit
of
my
neck
and
head

the
ability
to
see
these
cue
me
into
the
fact
that
im
still
in
a
closed
eyed
visual
world

the
visual
effects
feel
very
much
so
like
a
blending
of
the
two
chemicals
i
have
taken

the
precision
in
the
details
feels
like
dmt
but
the
colorlessness
and
static
movement
seems
to
draw
from
the
ketamine

my
mental
space
feels
expanded

im
transcending
above
my
point
of
view
seeing
the
room
from
higher
than
my
seated
position

it
is
proving
difficult
to
pay
attention
to
anything
except
the
visuals
and
turning
away
is
next
to
impossible
im
transfixed

the
bones
swirl
in
a
circle
hung
vertically
in
the
air
so
that
i
stare
through
the
center
like
the
letter
\x93o

their
pattern
of
motion
is
slow
and
smooth

i
can
see
the
\x93normal
kitchen
on
either
side
of
the
psychedelic
shapes
and
even
through
the
center
of
them

the
bones
go
slower
slower
slower
and
finally
pause
in
midair

things
crank
back
into
gear
in
the
reverse
direction
and
then
rapidly
accelerate

suddenly
the
rotating
circle
splits
into
four
circles
each
angling
more
forward
than
the
next

the
result
is
a
spinning
as
a
unit
and
rotating
as
individual
lines
three
dimensional
orb
made
of
the
tiny
bones

this
lasts
just
a
split
second
before
the
shape
collapses
onto
itself

the
four
circles
realign
but
are
now
spinning
splat
like
a
frisbee

things
are
chaotic
the
flat
white
color
is
developing
into
a
shimmering
display

this
fizzles
and
peters
out
in
an
anticlimactic
finish

i
can
sense
this
moment
of
coming
to
an
end

i
can
feel
the
tryptamine
taking
over
the
dissociative
which
has
been
slightly
dominant
for
the
immediately
previous
section
of
time

the
dmt
produces
a
glowing
calmness
that
is
almost
tangible

a
sense
of
awareness
of
and
connectedness
to
the
world

there
is
no
visual
representation
of
these
feelings
but
it
is
as
though
the
air
is
saturated
with
these
notions
and
they
absorb
into
me
before
exiting
out
cycling
the
energies
back
into
the
world

i
physically
feel
grounded
like
an
energy
source
unknown
is
keeping
my
physical
body
very
upright

im
still
seated
in
the
same
spot
but
the
supernatural
energy
has
drawn
me
upright
making
my
spine
straight
and
drawing
my
shoulders
back

im
very
still
both
externally
and
internally

there
is
no
pulling
or
pushing
whirling
or
swirling
like
i
have
experienced
on
heavy
dosages
of
ketamine
in
the
past

i
feel
myself
integrate
into
the
room
that
i
departed
when
i
inhaled
the
dmt

a
bit
of
normalcy
makes
its
way
back
into
my
mind

my
visual
perspective
is
back
to
normal
the
special
\x93viewpoint
is
dwindling

i
am
viewing
the
world
from
my
own
eyes
and
location
in
space
once
again

the
separate
existences
begin
to
come
together

the
four
distinct
trains
of
thought
still
exist
but
i
find
myself
cycling
through
them
rather
than
maintaining
each
at
the
same
time



i
drop
from
a
+++
to
a
+
extremely
quickly

perhaps
im
slightly
above
a
+
but
in
comparison
to
the
peak
i
feel
drastically
more
sober

this
come
down
takes
just
shy
of
five
minutes

i
start
being
able
speak
and
take
a
stab
at
explaining
what
happened
to
bodhi
and
iroh

my
mind
feels
simplistic
and
i
stutter
with
some
\x93umms
and
\x93likes
as
i
attempt
to
convey
some
of
the
visuals
and
the
multiple
mental
spaces
i
have
just
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying

the
strands
of
time
begin
to
weave
into
a
more
recognizable
tapestry

the
past
fifteen
minutes
or
so
felt
more
like
an
hour

at
the
same
time
the
peak
of
the
experience
seemed
to
transcend
time
it
had
an
immeasurable
quality
about
it

it
felt
as
though
time
slowed
down
gradually
as
the
ketamine
worked
its
way
into
my
system
until
about
two
minutes
after
the
dmt
was
smoked

at
this
point
i
popped
out
of
the
time
continuum
disconnected
from
ideas
of
\x93short
or
\x93long

i
only
recognize
the
time
stretch
now
from
a
perspective
much
closer
to
baseline
that
can
comprehend
the
concepts
of
seconds
minutes
and
hours

conversation
becomes
sparse

bodhi
is
preparing
for
a
full
tilt
dmt
experience
with
slow
yogic
breathing

iroh
and
i
respect
and
contribute
to
the
silence
happy
to
share
a
smile
and
nod
before
shutting
our
eyes
and
lying
back

the
visuals
on
my
eyelids
are
much
less
immersive
at
this
point
but
i
still
have
the
ability
to
make
them
my
reality
with
minimal
effort

instead
of
watching
them
like
images
on
a
screen
i
drift
through
them
as
a
weightless
entity
nothing
more
than
a
point
of
view

there
is
only
faint
sensations
of
movement
as
i
navigate

i
have
some
directional
control
to
my
movement
but
less
so
than
in
past
strong
dissociative
experiences

the
landscape
i
drift
through
is
unspecific
and
simple

a
mess
of
layered
clouds
laggardly
rearrange
themselves
on
all
sides
of
me

i
drift
casually
as
though
on
calm
waters
but
the
surroundings
are
giant
and
rough
like
a
storming
sea

the
clouds
around
me
are
deep
and
saturated
burgundy
and
black
the
colors
melting
and
swirling
unhurriedly
into
one
another

i
open
my
eyes
and
the
change
in
scenery
is
startling

i
feel
the
influence
of
the
ketamine
almost
exclusively

choppy
thought
patterns
encourage
me
to
think
less

the
numbness
that
encompasses
my
body
is
pleasant
enough
to
sit
in
silence
and
enjoy

as
i
become
more
comfortable
with
my
eyes
open
adjusting
to
this
reality
i
realize
once
again
that
there
are
other
people
in
the
room

[803

i
take
a
minute
to
write
some
notes
in
my
notebook

my
handwriting
is
complete
chicken
scratch

feeling
the
need
for
water
as
well
as
urination
i
stand
for
the
first
time

i
do
so
slowly
and
avoid
any
major
wobbling
or
stumbling
on
my
way
to
achieve
these
two
activities

water
is
completely
divine

my
dry
mouth
has
been
secretly
craving
hydration
apparently

the
bathroom
is
uneventful
but
something
about
the
smaller
space
and
harsher
lighting
makes
me
feel
more
intoxicated

the
texture
on
the
walls
shifts
when
i
direct
my
gaze
to
it

slowly
the
lines
of
plaster
wiggle
around
snaking
and
sneaking
their
way
into
new
patterns
and
formations

i
dont
find
this
amusing
or
fun



i
shudder
to
my
core
the
irrational
fear
of
tripping
too
hard
grips
me
tightly

i
wash
my
hands
and
dart
back
to
join
my
friends

as
soon
as
i
cross
the
threshold
into
the
living
room
the
negative
feelings
dissipate

our
group
tone
is
relatively
serious

although
i
feel
i
have
made
it
through
the
part
of
my
evening
that
was
potentially
challenging
bodhi
is
just
beginning
his

we
all
settle
into
our
spots
on
the
floor
and
i
handle
the
volcano
and
scale

dexterity
is
slightly
impaired
but
several
well
practiced
taps
with
the
index
finger
of
my
right
hand
deliver
the
desired
mg
onto
the
tray
of
the
scale

my
vision
has
a
fair
amount
of
visual
static
my
most
frequently
repeated
visual
across
all
of
my
substance
experiences

currently
black
and
white
dots
about
the
size
of
american
dimes
dance
shimmering
and
glimmering

the
static
is
most
obvious
in
the
corners
of
my
vision
but
a
more
delicate
veil
of
the
flickering
black
and
white
lays
on
top
of
everything
in
my
sight

the
crinkling
of
the
volcano
bag
is
comically
loud
what
a
sound

the
seriousness
evaporates
from
the
room
as
the
three
of
us
exchange
some
quick
jokes

somehow
the
comical
name
\x93chris
crinkle
develops
as
a
play
on
kris
kringle

the
three
of
us
are
overtaken
entirely
by
uncontrollable
giggles

the
laughs
are
cut
short
as
the
pitch
of
the
crinkling
grows
higher
and
the
frequency
more
rapid

myself

baseline

no

writing
out

notes

position

with
other

noteworthy
observations

that

and
beginning

feel
myself
become

at

we
have

survived
our
peaks

i
retrieve
a
cold
beer

from

refrigerator

it
tastes
especially
wonderful

like
a
beer
at

i
have
my
second
beer
[46%

as
bodhi
iroh
and
i
begin
to
discuss
what
we
went
through
for
the
past
few
hours
[not
previously
mentioned
iroh
has
been
dabbling
in
ketamine
and
a
few
light
hits
of
dmt]

thoughts
are
now
forming
in
an
increasingly
normal
fashion

the
more
the
conversation
develops
and
spins
off
into
random
sidebars
the
easier
it
is
to
forget
i
am
coming
down
from
anything

some
minor
tinnitus
adds
a
layer
of
sound
to
the
background
in
addition
to
the
mellow
lo-fi
music
we
have
selected

a
natural
but
powerful
sense
of
belonging
to
this
exact
space
and
time
saturates
all
other
emotions
and
coats
every
thought

a
natural
but
powerful
sense
of
belonging
to
this
exact
space
and
time
saturates
all
other
emotions
and
coats
every
thought


from
previous
experiences
i
can
confidently
say
that
this
is
result
of
the
ketamine
trailing
away
leaving
me
with
the
afterglow
of
the
dmt

this
glow
is
usually
relatively
strong
until
i
go
through
a
full
nights
sleep
and
sometimes
depending
on
the
content
and
intensity
of
the
experience
can
linger
for
days
afterwards

i
couldnt
be
happier
to
sip
my
beer
bask
in
this
glow
and
spend
time
with
friends






additional
commentary



this
was
a
solid
enjoyable
positive
experience

the
visual
effects
were
nothing
short
of
spectacular

some
of
the
white
outline
visuals
felt
very
much
like
a
strong
closed
eyed
visual
induced
from
ketamine

the
bones
and
cubes
were
minimalistic
yet
sophisticated
and
were
highly
integrated
with
\x93reality
visible
with
my
eyes
open
in
my
kitchen

some
of
the
things
i
saw
appeared
more
as
items
in
this
physical
world
than
as
a
\x93visual
-
they
were
very
real

unique
strong
and
immersive
visuals
everything
i
was
hoping
for
from
this
combination
of
substances

the
two
substances
played
very
well
together

using
the
volcano
did
away
with
my
number
one
complaint
about
combining
dmt
with
other
substances
this
being
the
difficulty
of
using
an
open
flame
and
glass
pipe
or
device
while
already
heavily
under
the
influence
of
a
substance

i
found
the
transition
into
a
deep
dmt
space
less
jarring
and
difficult
when
the
take-off
occurred
from
a
++
dissociative
condition

i
was
calmer
less
concerned
with
the
potential
of
a
bad
time
and
as
a
result
able
to
soak
in
the
entirety
of
the
experience

i
have
used
alcohol
benzodiazepines
opioids
and
opiates
as
launchpads
for
dmt
in
the
past
to
try
and
ease
this
transition

separately
from
these
i
have
combined
dmt
with
other
psychedelics
with
the
goal
of
exploring
different
visual
and
mental
places

this
is
the
only
substance
thus
far
that
has
performed
both
the
function
of
synergizing
with
the
dmt
for
a
unique
set
of
effects
as
well
as
easing
the
entrance
to
the
experience
[i
suspect
other
dissociatives
would
work
in
a
similar
manner]

the
comedown
from
the
combination
was
enjoyable

that
being
said
i
usually
dont
mind
the
comedown
process
when
using
either
ketamine
or
dmt
on
their
own
so
i
wasnt
particularly
surprised
to
find
this
true
for
the
combination

i
did
think
it
was
noteworthy
how
short
the
overall
duration
was

an
hour
after
smoking
the
dmt
i
felt
there
was
nothing
i
documented
worth
sharing

the
lingering
effects
blended
into
the
few
beers
i
drank

i
achieved
a
±
condition
by
t
+
0347
[1025
pm]

i
dont
think
i
reached
a
true
baseline
to
a
-
until
the
next
day

even
then
there
was
the
mysterious
glow
that
created
a
little
extra
sparkle
in
my
existence

my
immediate
reaction
to
the
experience
was
not
one
of
emotional
or
mental
growth

there
was
certainly
some
internal
analysis
pertaining
to
\x93how
and
why
my
mind
separated
into
multiple
thought
processing
segments

mostly
i
was
impressed
with
the
refreshing
afterglow
that
radiated
through
me
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
after
the
last
timestamp
included
in
the
report

as
i
ruminated
on

the
experience
i
was
able
to
theorize
some
interesting
parallels
between
the
multiple
mental
computing
spaces
and
my
daily
sober
mind

i
dont
think
the
details
will
be
generally
useful
to
anyone
besides
myself
so
ill
spare
that
detail

the
most
useful
of
these
thoughts
were
centered
around
the
analysis
of
my
general
day
to
day
indecisiveness
and
anxiety
and
how
they
were
similar
to
my
multiple
simultaneous
perceptions

i
found
both
positives
and
negatives
in
this
aspect
of
my
personality

the
concept
of
being
actively
aware
of
these
potential
overthinking
moments
or
habits
and
the
related
difficulties
while
they
occur
was
profound
and
useful

a
general
happiness
about
life
and
appreciation
for
my
position
in
it
was
the
most
obvious
lasting
effect
from
the
experience

it
weened
from
a
+
intensity
immediately
following
my
last
timestamp
to
barely
perceptible
two
days
later

at
this
point
the
effect
came
and
went
but
was
not
particularly
intoxicating

it
was
almost
indistinguishable
from
a
boost
in
mood
due
to
something
as
simple
as
a
moment
of
sun
at
the
end
of
a
rainy
day

at
no
point
during
the
experience
did
i
feel
the
presence
of
entities
any
sort
of
otherworldly
being

in
standard
dmt
verbiage
i
certainly
peaked
short
of
a
\x93breakthrough
experience

in
a
similar
comparison
i
did
not
\x93hole
which
common
nomenclature
refers
to
as
having
out
of
body
experiences
on
dissociative
substances

there
was
no
feeling
of
sinking
away
from
the
world
or
motion
at
all
for
that
matter

i
stayed
more
present
and
\x93first
person
than
other
strong
ketamine
experiences
i
have
had
in
my
past

i
had
an
interesting
alteration
in
the
way
i
processed
time
and
existed
within
it
during
the
peak
of
this
experience

it
was
not
simply
that
i
looked
at
a
clock
twice
and
the
second
time
thought
wow
it
seems
longer
than
that

this
was
no
simple
linear
stretching
of
time

i
was
having
rapid
thoughts
far
faster
than
i
do
sober

faster
than
most
stimulants
make
me
process
ideas

this
was
blindingly
fast

unlike
the
fast
visions
and
thoughts
i
often
have
on
dmt
alone
i
was
able
to
process
things
at
the
speed
they
occurred

unlike
the
fast
visions
and
thoughts
i
often
have
on
dmt
alone
i
was
able
to
process
things
at
the
speed
they
occurred


normally
i
would
be
left
in
the
dust
by
the
tryptamines
blazing
speed

it
didnt
feel
as
dizzyingly
quick
because
my
processing
speed
was
just
as
rapid

i
stand
on
the
earth
while
it
hurtles
through
space
at
great
velocity
but
it
doesnt
feel
as
though
i
myself
am
moving
fast

that
is
how
my
thinking
felt
i
knew
it
was
occurring
at
a
tremendous
pace

but
because
i
was
keeping
up
everything
felt
more
manageable

despite
keeping
up
i
was
still
aware
of
the
lightning
pace
certainly
more
so
than
i
am
conscious
of
my
speed
traveling
through
space
on
a
daily
basis

the
truly
amazing
bit
was
that
i
kept
up
with
multiple
versions
of
ultra
expeditious
trains
of
thought
all
at
the
same
time

i
also
retained
memory
of
many
of
these
thoughts
and
visuals
in
such
detail
that
i
was
able
to
document
them
in
the
hours
following
their
occurrence

this
is
not
always
possible
for
me

the
experience
was
powerful
enough
to
make
me
want
to
repeat
it

to
push
things
further
even

but
also
it
was
intimidating
enough
that
despite
my
excitement
about
the
combination
it
took
me
several
months
to
put
ketamine
and
dmt
together
again
even
then
it
was
at
lower
dosages
of
both
substances

im
sure
the
time
will
come
to
let
one
of
these
substances
or
both
at
once
if
i
can
achieve
perfect
timing
take
me
to
its
terminal
intensity

when
that
moment
arrives
im
sure
ill
know

and
i
look
forward
to
it

background
experienced
with
many
different
psychedelics
especially
tryptamines
a
natural
inclination
towards
anything
psychological
spiritual
or
otherworldly
mindset
adventurous
sleepy
good

the
experience

i
started
off
by
drinking
some
mushroom
tea
i
had
infused
exactly
1
gram
of
what
i
knew
to
be
very
potent
mushrooms
into
the
water
previously
boiled
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
the
mushroom
tea
its
always
so
calming
and
meditative
for
me
to
just
sit/lay
down
drinking
the
tea
and
clearing
my
mind
before
the
journey
it
feels
sacred
and
reminiscent
of
something
my
ancestors
did
-
very
grounding
for
me

i
drank
the
tea
slowly
and
when
i
finished
it
i
felt
a
little
something
already
as
it
had
been
about
20
minutes
i
then
prepared
a
bowl
of
caapi
leaves
on
top
of
weed
for
smoking
i
went
to
the
window
and
smoked
these
together
i
smoked
three
bowls
in
succession
because
i
knew
that
i
needed
a
substantial
amount
of
these
caapi
leaves

not
extract
just
plain
leaves
to
get
a
decent
effect
and
to
achieve
potentiation
of
the
trip
i
definitely
got
the
potentiation
i
was
looking
for
it
was
a
relatively
quick
but
still
somewhat
gradual
ascent
and
the
difference
was
very
noticeable
i
felt
like
the
come-up
all
happened
at
once
after
the
effects
of
the
caapi
hit
me
i
felt
dreamier
and
more
blissful
as
caapi
seems
to
help
bring
about
this
peaceful
effect
my
open
eye
visuals
became
particularly
interesting
and
i
began
to
get
a
similar
visual
effect
to
many
of
the
other
times
ive
done
mushrooms
and/or
dmt
this
effect
can
be
best
described
as
something
that
happens
when
i
look
ahead
of
myself
anywhere
from
5
to
20
feet
away
what
happens
is
wherever
im
looking
the
empty
space
that
my
eyes
are
focused
on
develops
into
various
shapes
its
as
if
the
empty
space
appears
as
a
type
of
clear
plasma
and
then
starts
to
get
defined
edges
and
proceeds
to
form
into
these
shapes
then
the
shapes
break
apart
and
the
small
pieces
come
towards
me
on
either
side

as
the
pieces
come
towards
me
sometimes
they
move
in
strange
rigid
often
symmetrical
patterns
and
other
times
they
messily
tumble
on
over
but
every
time
this
happens
the
pieces
are
on
each
side
right
and
left
of
where
i
was
originally
looking
and
they
tumble
over
to
me
on
either
side
above
my
head
and
then
come
down
to
the
ground
on
either
side
of
me
when
they
come
down
upon
me
i
can
feel
their
energy
sweep
over
me
sometimes
it
almost
feels
like
a
light
breeze
this
happened
countless
times
throughout
the
trip
in
fact
from
smoking
the
caapi
on
i
dont
think
this
effect
went
away
for
the
entire
experience
things
felt
very
hyperspacey
and
alien
yet
familiar
in
a
similar
way
to
the
dmt
space
i
kept
losing
myself
in
strange
trains
of
thought
that
just
spiraled
deeper
and
deeper
until
words
could
not
describe
under
any
circumstances
what
these
concepts
were
whenever
i
came
out
of
the
trance
a
bit
and
attempted
to
extract
whatever
it
was
i
had
just
been
thinking
about
the
thoughts
would
dissipate
almost
as
if
they
werent
compatible
with
the
conscious
part
of
my
mind

in
fact
sometimes
the
thoughts
would
even
seem
to
disguise
themselves
as
other
thoughts
that
made
more
sense
but
i
would
feel
that
these
replacement
thoughts
didnt
come
close
to
the
complexity
or
meaning
of
the
original
ones
i
came
to
call
the
original
thoughts
inaccessible
thoughts
because
usually
i
cant
access
them
from
my
conscious
mind
these
thoughts
come
to
my
mind
often
when
using
caapi
and
since
this
experience
when
using
caapi
other
times
i
have
been
able
to
extract
a
few
of
them
by
trying
exceptionally
hard
to
hold
on
to
them
and
then
write
them
down
as
best
as
i
can
in
this
case
the
thoughts
have
ended
up
translating
to
what
seem
to
be
premonitions
of
the
future
various
situations
that
seem
plausible
but
have
never
actually
happened
-
at
least
not
yet

anyway
i
kept
on
smoking
the
caapi
and
went
into
my
room
to
trance
out
i
found
that
this
level
of
blissfulness
was
hard
to
contain
i
eagerly
let
go
of
myself
and
went
back
and
forth
between
realities
i
kept
lapsing
out
of
existence
and
returning
home
so
refreshing
and
just
so
right
there
was
no
mistaking
that
this
feeling
was
quite
erotic
as
well
though
not
by
a
physical
sense
in
the
slightest
on
the
astral
plane
various
entities
came
to
me
and
would
give
me
advice
and
food
for
thought
many
of
these
issues
are
personal
but
they
had
to
do
with
various
life
choices
things
that
could
or
might
happen
in
my
life
and
people
in
my
life
that
i
have
met
or
would
meet
and
change
the
course
of
my
life
forever
although
this
astral
plane
was
not
by
any
means
only
inhabited
by
light
forces
as
opposed
to
dark
ones
i
will
say
that
it
felt
perfectly
crafted
it
was
exactly
what
it
needed
to
be
and
i
accepted
it
completely
and
lovingly
because
i
wasnt
really
attached
to
my
ego
a
lot
of
this
banter
between
me
and
entities
took
place
through
abstract
communications
that
seemed
to
be
of
a
different
nature
or
language
however
i
could
still
decode
and
understand
it
because
it
coincided
with
the
kinds
of
communications
that
my
ego
self
can
normally
understand
these
communications
just
had
to
be
transmitted
in
alternate
ways
since
my
ego
self
was
barely
present
i
cant
put
into
words
what
these
abstract
communications
were
because
they
were
just
that
-
too
abstract


soon
enough
i
decided
to
put
about
20mg
of
dmt
in
the
pipe
between
the
caapi
leaves
this
turned
out
to
be
a
great
idea
i
felt
no
hesitation
this
time
as
nearly
every
time
before
doing
dmt
i
become
nervous
even
though
i
love
it
the
caapi
actually
made
me
kind
of
crave
the
dmt
it
seemed
i
have
heard
of
this
happening
to
others
as
well
with
caapi
the
dmt
just
being
well
yummy
for
lack
of
a
better
adjective
after
having
the
dmt
i
felt
super
trancey
and
wanted
to
close
my
eyes
but
oddly
enough
i
felt
that
some
sort
of
entity
was
telling
me
to
keep
them
open
i
dont
know
why
this
is
when
i
closed
my
eyes
i
saw
nothing
but
when
i
kept
my
eyes
open
the
entire
room
was
transformed
and
there
were
beings
inside
every
piece
of
furniture
every
empty
space
every
wall
i
could
feel
the
personalities
of
each
being
it
was
out
of
this
world
and
amazing

sometimes
the
bliss
would
overcome
me
and
i
would
start
to
close
my
eyes
but
then
a
conceptual
voice
or
entity
would
alert
me
and
tell
me
to
keep
my
eyes
open
and
pay
attention
to
what
was
happening
in
the
room
my
intention
of
this
experience
had
been
to
take
in
my
surroundings
and
appreciate
them
because
i
would
be
moving
soon
and
i
wanted
to
reflect
on
the
times
i
had
spent
at
this
location
so
maybe
this
was
just
a
way
for
me
to
fulfill
my
original
intention
because
this
is
a
new
house
nobody
has
lived
in
it
before
its
current
inhabitants
including
me
otherwise
perhaps
i
would
have
felt
the
energies
of
previous
inhabitants
and
relived
foreign
memories
i
felt
as
if
i
were
reliving
various
things
that
had
happened
in
the
room
so
far
to
me
and
others
that
had
lived
here
all
of
which
felt
vaguely
familiar
because
theyd
taken
place
in
my
life
but
since
i
was
an
egoless
being
i
didnt
connect
them
to
my
personal
life
i
felt
that
i
was
able
to
see
them
in
a
completely
different
light
free
of
attachments
and
judgements
it
was
undoubtedly
therapeutic

i
walked
into
the
backyard
after
this
and
revisited
the
plant
spirits
outside
id
had
an
experience
a
couple
of
weeks
before
where
id
taken
15
grams
of
the
same
mushrooms
and
had
felt
all
of
the
plants
personalities
there
was
one
tree
that
looked
like
a
popsicle
and
it
was
pretty
huge
i
felt
like
this
tree
was
almost
condescending
and
didnt
really
like
humans
that
much
there
was
another
plant
with
jagged
leaves
that
seemed
very
feminine
and
stylish
i
picked
up
on
an
ambivalent
attitude
from
this
plant
another
tree
was
one
in
which
i
had
climbed
in
the
past
to
save
my
partners
cat
and
he
greeted
me
with
recognition
and
approval

all
throughout
this
time
i
kept
smoking
bowls
with
caapi
and
weed
mixed
together
those
empty
space
visuals
never
went
away
it
seemed
like
this
time
they
were
often
chess-themed
there
were
some
bowling
pins
included
in
there
too
for
whatever
reason
there
were
mainly
pawns
and
queens
and
horses
and
other
chess
pieces
folding
and
breaking
into
pieces
and
coming
towards
me
everywhere
i
turned
i
found
this
to
be
fascinating
and
if
i
moved
my
eyes
in
certain
ways
i
could
control
the
ways
in
which
they
broke
into
pieces
and
the
patterns
they
made
on
the
way
over
to
me
i
liked
the
way
it
felt
when
they
came
down
above
my
head
and
landed
on
either
side
of
me
it
felt
like
they
were
saying
hello
and
giving
me
presents
the
perfectly
blissful
feeling
of
exploring
the
hyperspace
version
of
the
territory
i
was
usually
so
familiar
with
and
appreciating
everything
about
existence
persisted
for
me
and
i
couldnt
have
possibly
been
happier
to
be
right
where
i
was
in
the
moment


i
went
inside
and
loaded
up
another
bowl
of
weed
+
caapi
+
dmt
and
then
went
back
outside
to
the
side
of
the
house
and
sat
on
a
concrete
block
in
the
yard
it
had
been
more
than
half
an
hour
since
the
last
time
i
had
dmt
as
i
like
to
wait
at
least
30
minutes
between
dmt
voyages
when
im
already
tripping
on
something
else
or
at
all
for
that
matter
but
i
tend
to
only
use
dmt
on
top
of
other
psychedelics
nowadays
because
id
already
smoked
a
couple
bowls
of
caapi
prior
to
this
i
got
started
on
the
bowl
with
the
dmt
right
away
like
the
last
time
it
came
on
very
strongly
with
a
relatively
small
amount
but
this
time
i
experienced
an
entirely
different
emotional
effect
suddenly
an
intense
fear
was
struck
into
me
it
was
like
one
second
i
felt
totally
relaxed
and
blissful
and
the
next
second
i
was
dealing
with
a
deep-rooted
fear
whose
origin
was
unknown
to
me
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
ground
and
how
i
could
see
everything
decaying
and
turning
into
other
things

it
was
as
if
i
was
concentrating
on
how
different
animals
and
organic
materials
had
absorbed
into
the
dirt
and
grass
and
decayed
and
then
the
particles
that
made
those
up
recycled
themselves
into
other
things
i
felt
as
if
i
was
watching
this
cycle
of
death
and
rebirth
and
became
hyperaware
of
all
of
the
things
that
had
died
and
decomposed
and
then
been
recycled
into
new
materials
and
new
life
in
this
very
yard
however
the
random
fear
seemed
very
urgent
it
seemed
like
somebody
was
trying
to
tell
me
something
important
i
noticed
that
a
certain
triangular
part
of
the
grass
a
little
bit
in
front
of
me
to
the
left
was
much
brighter
than
the
rest
of
the
yard
it
wasnt
actually
but
thats
what
i
saw
i
understood
that
this
triangular
section
of
the
yard
was
apparently
a
danger
zone
and
i
felt
that
some
entity
was
warning
me
that
there
were
negative
spirits
there
and
i
had
to
be
extra
careful
and
aware
to
not
allow
the
negativity
in
to
my
own
psyche
at
the
time
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
make
of
this
and
still
am
not
sure
to
this
day

i
dont
necessarily
believe
in
spirits
or
dmt
entities
as
being
apart
from
my
consciousness
i
dont
have
any
beliefs
when
it
comes
to
this
sort
of
thing
-
i
keep
an
open
mind
to
all
possibilities
but
at
the
time
the
fear
made
it
seem
so
real
to
me
that
i
tried
to
listen
to
the
entity
that
had
just
communicated
to
me
to
be
careful
and
i
stayed
aware
and
alert
so
as
to
not
let
in
this
negative
energy
that
was
threatening
me
in
the
danger
zone
this
fear
gradually
dissipated
and
i
once
again
felt
blessed
and
left
with
the
same
blissful
and
transcendent
tryptamine
feeling
id
had
throughout
the
entire
experience
up
until
that
random
fearful
moment
during
the
moments
where
i
felt
fearful
it
didnt
actually
bother
me
very
much
i
took
the
fear
for
what
it
was
and
didnt
make
it
into
anything
else
fear
is
just
an
emotion
i
knew
somewhere
within
myself
that
i
didnt
*actually*
have
anything
to
fear
i
just
wondered
and
still
do
what
this
meant
or
whether
i
might
be
able
to
think
of
any
metaphorical
interpretations
to
what
i
experienced
in
the
yard

after
i
came
down
from
the
dmt
i
was
still
seeing
plenty
of
oevs
and
still
seeing
the
objects
forming
out
of
empty
space
and
tumbling
towards
me
i
thanked
the
universe
and
the
plant
spirits
for
these
presents

i
decided
to
take
a
walk
to
the
park
down
the
street
the
leaves
were
just
beginning
to
change
as
my
favorite
season
autumn
was
starting
the
leaves
delighted
me
and
walking
felt
interesting
it
was
like
i
was
hovering
a
few
inches
off
the
ground
when
i
got
to
the
park
i
passed
some
people
and
could
feel
all
of
their
energies
very
intensely
i
got
the
sense
that
most
of
these
people
didnt
really
look
too
deeply
into
life
which
felt
like
a
shame
to
me
but
i
supposed
that
everyone
was
just
who
they
were
meant
to
be
all
the
same
it
was
incredibly
interesting
being
at
the
park
people-watching
and
i
felt
like
i
could
hear
things
and
make
out
words
being
said
from
far
away
this
happens
to
me
a
lot
on
caapi
where
i
experience
these
heightened
sensory
abilities

i
felt
like
a
fly
on
the
wall
in
the
distance
a
spy
almost
thats
how
clear
things
were
that
people
were
saying
from
far
away
i
had
begun
to
get
very
tired
by
this
point
as
it
was
almost
6
hours
after
id
drank
the
tea
i
sat
down
on
a
log
in
the
park
somewhere
and
put
my
head
down
and
just
tranced
out
in
a
half
trippy
half
sleepy
state
of
mind
i
stayed
here
for
another
20
minutes
or
so
then
began
to
walk
back
home
as
soon
as
i
got
home
feeling
refreshed
from
the
nice
afterglow
i
jumped
into
bed
and
fell
into
a
deeper-than-usual
sleep
rather
quickly

because
caapi
is
a
rima
maoi
and
doesnt
last
very
long
and
on
top
of
that
my
route
of
administration
was
smoking
i
experienced
no
negative
side
effects
such
as
nausea
or
stomach
discomfort
and
did
not
have
to
watch
my
diet
i
felt
that
the
caapi
made
the
mushroom
trip
much
more
visual
than
id
ever
experienced
mushrooms
to
be
before
and
i
felt
much
more
spiritually
ecstatic
than
usual
throughout
the
entire
experience
i
also
felt
much
more
dreamlike
smoked
caapi
seems
to
work
wonders
with
mushrooms
and
dmt
terence
mckenna
was
definitely
onto
something
when
he
suggested
smoking
caapi
leaves
on
top
of
mushrooms
im
going
to
have
to
explore
this
combination
furthermore




this
report
documents
two
back-to-back
experiences
i
had
smoking
dmt
while
also
under
the
influence
of
lsd
and
mdma
the
first
experience
was
one
of
my
most
beautiful
and
the
second
experience
was
definitely
the
most
terrifying
trip
i
have
ever
had
i
went
to
both
extremes
experiencing
the
light
side
and
the
dark
side
of
dmt
in
a
matter
of
hours

background
i
am
a
24
year
old
male
weighing
120
pounds
in
good
mental
and
physical
health
i
take
no
medications
although
i
do
use
marijuana
and
yerba
mate
on
a
daily
basis
i
have
extensive
experience
with
psychedelic
drugs
and
consider
myself
very
familiar
with
tryptamines
mushrooms
lsd
dmt
and
5-meo-dmt
alone
or
in
combination
with
harmala
alkaloids
phenethylamines
mdma
trichocereus
cacti
2c-i
2c-e
and
2c-b
and
have
some
experience
with
dissociatives
salvia
ketamine
and
dxm

set
and
setting
i
was
feeling
uncomfortable
in
my
crowded
and
chaotic
home
and
had
a
burning
desire
to
get
out
of
the
house
for
a
night
i
had
been
worrying
a
lot
about
my
financial
security
and
the
safety
of
my
home
and
just
wanted
to
escape
for
a
while
conveniently
i
was
minding
a
beautiful
home
which
i
would
have
all
to
myself
peace
and
quiet
plus
the
mdma
monkey
was
on
my
back
again
urging
me
to
scratch
that
itch
i
have
used
mdma
a
lot
in
the
past
and
have
trouble
controlling
my
usage
i
tend
to
do
too
much
too
often
and
have
often
used
mdma
in
a
recreational
and
abusive
manner
mdma
is
my
\x93problem
drug
you
could
say


i
had
picked
up
a
gram
of
mdma
recently
doing
so
sneakily
so
that
my
partner
wouldnt
know
not
that
she
judges
me
but
i
feel
my
use
is
not
really
healthy
and
not
something
im
proud
of
so
often
i
am
scared
to
tell
her
sneaking
around
the
bush
never
helps
though
in
fact
i
always
end
up
breaking
down
and
telling
her
after
the
fact
how
much
i
had
taken
it
is
simpler
and
less
emotional
for
me
to
just
tell
the
truth
from
the
beginning

the
experience
so
out
i
went
a
pleasant
warm
spring
nights
walk
on
my
way
winding
through
parks
and
along
the
edges
of
a
golf
course
i
stopped
to
climb
into
a
golden
willows
branches
and
smoke
a
bowl
i
had
only
intended
on
taking
one
or
maybe
two
of
the
mdma
capsules
each
containing
100
mg
tonight
instead
by
the
time
i
got
to
my
destination
i
had
already
taken
three
and
then
proceeded
to
bump
a
little
more
when
i
got
there
in
total
i
ingested
roughly
350
milligrams

i
quickly
became
aware
that
i
had
taken
too
much
it
was
pretty
shitty
mdma
i
think
there
was
some
speed
in
there
for
sure
because
i
felt
a
lot
of
jittery
nervous
sensations
rather
than
the
mellow
relaxation
of
good
clean
stuff
and
the
nystagmus
man
my
eyes
were
twitching
like
butterflies
i
could
barely
see
straight
and
my
jaw
was
clenching
pretty
badly
what
about
my
short
term
memory
i
used
to
have
one
of
those
now
where
did
i
put
the
damn
thing

so
what
do
you
do
to
fill
the
hours
from
130
am
to
830
am
while
high
on
speedy
mdma
creating
a
giant
mandala
of
plants
rocks
and
other
random
household
goodies
of
course
it
started
off
pretty
simply
but
by
the
time
morning
rolled
around
well
you
couldnt
call
it
structured
simple
or
even
harmonious
crammed
overcrowded
and
chaotic
would
all
apply
i
kept
obsessively
going
out
into
the
garden
to
pick
handfuls
of
leaves
vines
fern
fronds
and
spring
flowers
to
decorate
my
mandala
i
had
nearly
all
the
plants
in
the
house
piling
up
around
the
edges
too

so
in
the
morning
feeling
rough
around
the
edges
and
having
trouble
regulating
my
electrolyte
balance
drinking
lots
of
liquids
but
not
having
my
thirst
quenched
i
called
my
partner
asking
her
to
come
over
and
meditate
with
me
around
my
mandala
haha
i
was
way
too
add
to
focus
for
more
than
a
second
and
instead
of
meditating
just
kept
fiddling
with
bits
of
leaves
and
flowers
making
small
obsessive
changes
to
my
decorations
my
partner
looked
pretty
sad
especially
when
i
said
i
was
going
to
stay
here
today
and
do
some
\x93introspective
looking
within
myself
also
known
as
getting
real
fuckin
high
on
drugs
she
went
home
still
sad
secretly
she
knew
i
was
high
on
mdma
and
secretly
i
knew
that
she
knew
i
was
high
on
mdma
but
neither
of
us
had
said
anything
about
it
yet

it
was
about
1
pm
now
13
hours
after
taking
the
mdma
i
hadnt
slept
in
over
24
hours
and
hadnt
eaten
for
about
17
hours
so
you
might
say
i
was
permeable
to
the
spirit
realms
having
drawn
a
little
closer
to
death
myself
over
the
last
day
i
feel
mdma
particularly
makes
it
easier
for
me
to
see
shadow
people
spirits
and
other
spooky
stuff
it
takes
me
nearer
to
death
and
thus
i
can
see
behind
the
veil
more
clearly

i
was
pretty
sure
i
was
setting
myself
up
for
an
introspective
nightmare
nevertheless
i
went
ahead
with
my
plan
dropping
four
hits
of
good
acid
and
a
capsule
of
about
200
mg
of
mdma
for
good
measure
or
because
the
monkey
was
on
my
back
again
already
stuffs
got
a
sinister
compelling
edge
to
it

and
so
stage
three
of
my
plan
of
epic
and
debaucherous
mind-dissolution
rolling
a
dmt
doobie
i
had
a
half
gram
of
high
purity
mimosa
hostilis
root
bark
extract
and
decided
to
go
heavy
super
heavy
actually
i
used
about
half
the
vial
roughly
250
milligrams
i
had
just
a
pinch
of
marijuana
shake
left
so
i
had
to
bulk
out
my
plant
material
with
some
finely
shredded
labrador
tea
bearberry
leaf
and
a
little
bit
of
yarrow
these
three
herbs
were
still
somewhat
fresh
retaining
a
little
moisture
which
is
a
good
thing
for
dmt
doobies
slow
burning
warm
enough
to
vaporize
the
dmt
but
not
so
hot
as
to
scorch
it
i
added
the
finishing
touch
a
generous
sprinkling
of
coca
tea
figuring
it
would
numb
the
throat
in
a
pleasant
way

half
an
hour
later
the
mdma
and
lsd
i
had
taken
were
coming
on
so
i
ventured
out
into
the
backyard
for
my
special
doobie
it
was
a
beautiful
sunny
day
blue
sky
and
green
grass
i
lay
down
with
a
shirt
over
my
head
to
shade
me
from
the
sun
and
sparked
the
joint
i
smoked
a
couple
hits
finding
the
taste
extremely
mild
and
mostly
unnoticeable
after
the
first
toke
very
smooth
thanks
to
mama
coca
it
wasnt
really
hitting
me
hard
the
way
a
marijuana
plus
dmt
joint
usually
does
but
i
shugged
it
off
and
puffed
some
more
just
keep
smoking

the
transition
to
dmt
space
was
startling
in
its
rapidity
one
moment
i
was
puffing
and
perhaps
the
trees
had
begun
to
fractalize
just
a
little
the
next
moment
bam
fully
in
i
vaguely
remember
sitting
up
and
pushing
the
towel
off
my
head
as
i
went
into
the
trance

the
trees
were
doing
the
most
amazing
dance
ever
thick
grey
bark
wrinkled
up
and
down
their
trunks
the
branches
defining
the
planes
of
a
complex
three-dimensional
space
around
the
tree
there
was
this
incredible
sound
humming
and
hawing
going
up
and
down
warbling
through
different
tones
a
whirling
clanking
mechanical
sound
like
an
amusement
park
ride
and
these
electric
zing-ziiing
noises
the
trees
were
bouncing
dancing
up
and
down
as
the
sounds
grew
in
intensity
and
pitch

when
the
vibrations
reached
a
critical
threshold
the
trees
would
do
a
quarter-turn
clockwise
twist
turning
a
corner
with
a
flash
of
green
leaves
and
then
exploding
out
the
top
with
a
hundred
squiggly
purple-red
octopus
tentacles
as
well
as
amazingly
intricate
diamond-block
patterns
in
pale
blues
and
black
it
was
the
happy
dancing
tree
carnival

i
had
this
neat
omni-vision
thing
going
on
being
able
to
see
in
every
direction
simultaneously
i
would
see
the
dances
trees
oh
yes
and
the
fractalizing
sky
and
even
the
grass
i
was
lying
on
the
grass
looked
so
crazy
it
got
all
tall
and
spiky
looking
like
astroturf
from
a
far
distant
planet
everything
in
my
vision
was
hyper-saturated
in
colour
a
palette
of
blues
greens
and
the
grey
of
the
tree
trunks

the
feeling
went
on
for
a
long
time
in
repeating
waves
slowly
the
waves
became
a
little
gentler
a
little
farther
spaced
apart
i
began
to
piece
my
mind
back
together
realizing
that
this
green
stuff
was
grass
and
that
i
was
still
lying
in
the
yard
as
i
dropped
totally
out
of
the
trance
i
flipped
myself
over
in
a
jarring
way
which
was
an
abrupt
end
to
the
trip
but
wow
what
a
trip
possibly
the
most
beautiful
and
amazing
dmt
experience
i
have
ever
had
the
setting
was
what
made
it
really
magical
with
the
acid
and
mdma
on
board
i
stayed
in
the
trance
state
longer
than
usually
probably
10
minutes
or
so
in
other
experiences
i
have
noticed
that
lsd
extends
the
duration
of
the
dmt
and
mdma
reduces
my
threshold
to
breakthrough

what
i
had
just
experienced
was
so
magical
that
i
contemplated
diving
again
having
enough
material
for
one
more
doobie
identical
to
the
one
i
had
just
smoked
i
thought
of
a
better
idea
however
i
rang
home
again
to
my
partner
after
struggling
for
several
minutes
trying
to
remember
our
home
number
ahem
yes
theres
that
short
term
memory
loss
at
its
finest
thanks
mdma
it
will
probably
be
a
few
more
days
before
i
can
remember
my
own
phone
number
again
when
i
finally
got
the
number
right
i
convinced
my
partner
to
drop
what
she
was
doing
and
come
back
right
away
no
dont
walk
take
the
car

i
was
super
excited
to
share
this
experience
with
her
i
figured
having
the
exact
same
ratios
of
dmt
and
plant
material
as
in
my
doobie
plus
the
exact
same
sunny
backyard
setting
and
she
should
have
a
similarly
amazing
experience
she
has
smoked
dmt
before
but
never
gone
all
the
way
through
often
feeling
fearful
as
the
intensity
ramps
up
i
wanted
to
give
her
the
experience
i
had
just
had
so
that
she
would
gain
a
comfort
level
with
the
breakthrough
dose
i
knew
it
would
make
her
happy

it
was
more
difficult
to
roll
this
doobie
since
by
now
i
was
really
high
i
couldnt
actually
see
straight
to
put
in
the
filter
so
i
got
her
to
do
that
when
she
arrived
i
rushed
her
into
the
yard
almost
as
soon
as
she
had
walked
in
the
door
getting
her
to
lay
down
the
same
way
i
had
with
a
view
of
the
trees
and
skyand
i
lit
her
joint
she
puffed
once
twice
a
couple
more
times
her
body
started
shaking
all
over
her
hand
still
holding
the
doobie
was
trembling
after
a
few
minutes
she
opened
her
eyes
saying
she
had
gotten
scared
as
the
experience
became
overwhelming
and
so
she
didnt
want
to
smoke
anymore
she
enjoyed
the
level
she
went
to
though
which
was
nice
she
had
smoked
about
the
same
as
me
probably
stopping
just
one
toke
short
of
the
breakthrough
point

by
now
i
was
over-excited
and
twitchy
feeling
the
eye
wiggles
had
started
up
again
and
i
was
pretty
sure
this
or
my
enthusiastic
speech
patterns
would
give
me
away
soon
enough
i
wanted
to
dive
again
so
i
tried
relighting
my
doobie
oh
yeah
i
hadnt
smoked
the
whole
thing
after
rolling
the
doobie
for
my
partner
i
said
to
myself
\x93wait
a
minute
i
couldnt
possibly
have
smoked
that
whole
thing
there
was
a
cardboard
filter
at
the
bottom
for
one
so
i
must
have
flailed
it
somewhere
as
i
came
out
of
the
trip
sure
enough
a
quick
search
and
there
it
was
i
had
only
managed
to
smoke
about
a
third
of
it
apparently
having
fallen
into
the
trance
as
i
was
smoking
factoring
in
a
little
loss
due
to
smouldering
plant
material
and
that
the
dmt
runs
down
the
joint
away
from
the
heat
i
figure
i
still
got
around
75
milligrams
a
hefty
dose
with
shaky
hands
i
tried
lighting
the
joint
again
but
three
times
it
went
out
right
away
perhaps
i
should
have
taken
that
as
a
sign

my
partner
said
she
would
like
to
try
the
dmt
again
if
i
would
go
first
i
guess
she
wanted
to
see
someone
else
in
the
deep
trance
for
reassurance
well
reassurance
was
definitely
not
on
the
plate
this
afternoon

a
reminder
that
i
was
under
conditions
of
sleep
deprivation
fasting
drug
abuse
and
still
coming
up
on
4
hits
of
acid
plus
200
mg
of
mdma
going
into
this
experience
yikes
sometimes
i
really
disgust
myself
i
lay
down
in
the
sun
again
with
the
rest
of
my
doobie
in
retrospect
it
was
a
bad
idea
to
be
lying
down
while
smoking
a
dmt
doobie
i
should
have
stayed
sitting
up
until
going
under
you
will
see
why
soon

i
puffed
once
twice
good
deep
hauls
i
could
see
the
trees
begin
to
shimmer
and
twist
just
a
little
thinking
\x93here
we
go
this
is
where
my
experience
of
events
and
her
experience
of
events
diverge
rapidly
i
will
tell
my
side
of
the
tale
first
and
then
follow
it
up
with
what
she
observed
in
my
experience
i
started
taking
a
third
haul
on
the
joint
all
of
a
sudden
i
sucked
a
big
chunk
of
hot
ash
and
leaf
material
into
my
mouth
i
felt
it
hit
the
back
of
my
throat
an
acrid
bitter
taste
and
smell
permeated
my
mouth
at
the
same
time
in
my
visual
field
the
delicate
lace-patterned
trees
were
no
more
this
contamination
a
black
spot
at
the
centre
of
my
vision
grew
outward
rapidly
like
a
mold
or
rust
fungus
everything
it
touched
turned
black
and
then
crumbled
into
ash
i
felt
the
tone
and
feeling
of
the
trip
change
from
light
to
dark

\x93are
you
okay
she
asked


\x93yes
i
replied
feeling
not
too
deep
in
the
trance
state
despite
everything
being
a
fractal
blur
i
leaned
over
to
spit
out
the
ash
from
my
mouth
my
partners
voice
drifted
over
to
me
and
my
head
followed
the
sound
very
rapidly
indeed

\x93papy
im
dead
she
said

\x93what
i
cried

her
bottom
lip
was
quivering
as
she
asked
\x93how
can
i
be
dead
i
wasnt
dead
two
seconds
ago

our
eyes
met
and
we
both
simultaneously
said
\x93fuck
i
dropped
my
eyes
in
anguish
\x93fuck
everything
in
this
dmt
space
was
the
polar
opposite
to
my
last
trip
instead
of
vibrant
blues
greens
and
greys
the
landscape
had
a
lot
of
neon
green
with
a
malevolent
washover
of
magenta
this
was
supposed
to
be
my
trip
my
experience
and
now
instead
she
was
dead

\x93papy
look
at
me
she
demanded
that
brought
my
gaze
up
fast
i
looked
into
her
left
eye
seeing
the
iris
open
up
i
knew
that
i
was
taking
an
exact
imprint
of
her
in
that
moment
i
realized
something
then
you
know
what
they
say
about
love
when
you
find
the
one
you
know
i
knew
in
this
moment
that
she
was
the
one
i
had
found
her
only
through
a
cruel
twist
of
circumstances
my
going
into
dmt
space
had
prematurely
snuffed
out
her
life
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong
we
were
perfect
for
each
other
but
it
has
her
fate
to
die
and
mine
to
live
i
knew
i
would
be
lonely
after
she
died
she
was
the
one
and
now
she
was
dead


her
demanding
me
to
look
at
her
had
made
me
aware
of
the
essence
of
her
womanhood
and
it
aroused
in
me
an
irresistable
compulsion
i
had
to
take
my
pants
off
and
do
her
right
here
\x93no
she
said
\x93you
cant
do
that
here


all
i
could
think
to
say
was
\x93i
dont
care
i
needed
her
but
she
wouldnt
let
me
take
my
pants
off
\x93fuck
i
said
again

\x93why
do
you
keep
saying
fuck
its
okay
papy

\x93how
can
it
be
okay
that
you
are
dead
i
asked

\x93thats
the
way
it
is
now
she
replied

\x93fuck
then
after
a
moment
i
said
\x93youre
right
this
is
the
way
it
is
now
i
guess
i
can
accept
that
you
are
dead
it
was
brutal
but
also
okay
that
she
was
dead
\x93this
is
the
way
it
is
now

slowly
slowly
my
mind
began
to
scrabble
at
a
return
i
wasnt
yet
aware
of
it
but
as
she
now
asked
me
\x93why
do
you
keep
saying
fuck
who
are
you
talking
to
it
was
the
real
girl
i
was
hearing
and
not
a
hallucination

\x93why
do
you
keep
saying
that
i
am
dead
and
i
could
see
tears
in
her
eyes

\x93well
look
at
you
youre
dead
indeed
as
the
veils
had
lifted
a
grey
pallor
had
come
over
her
face
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
she
was
dead
the
burning
need
to
get
naked
and
do
her
right
there
in
the
yard
was
still
strong
in
me
but
again
she
stopped
me
from
taking
off
my
pants

\x93why
do
you
keep
touching
your
penis
she
asked


\x93because
i
need
you
i
reply
i
was
getting
closer
the
fractal
blur
seemed
to
thin
just
a
little
as
usual
dropping
out
of
the
trance
state
happens
just
as
abruptly
as
going
into
it
a
bump
bump
bump
and
back
into
my
body
i
realized
that
what
i
was
experiencing
had
been
just
a
trip
and
not
reality
it
was
like
waking
up
from
a
terribly
twisted
sadistic
dreams
coming
out
of
my
trip
and
realizing
it
didnt
actually
happen
gave
me
the
hugest
rush
of
relief
and
happiness

the
first
sane
words
out
of
my
mouth
were
\x93youre
not
actually
dead
and
i
bearhugged
her


she
sounded
really
scared
when
she
said
\x93are
you
okay

\x93yes
came
my
emphatic
reply

\x93what
happened
she
questioned

\x93it
was
just
a
different
experience
the
first
one
was
all
light
and
this
one
was
all
dark

\x93are
you
sure
youre
okay
she
asked
again

\x93i
am
100%
okay
other
than
having
sucked
a
bearberry
leaf
into
the
back
of
my
mouth
i
guess
i
can
accept
one
bearberry
leaf
in
return
for
having
had
a
different
experience

\x93what
are
you
talking
about
she
asks
sounding
lost

\x93i
sucked
some
ash
into
my
mouth
probably
a
bearberry
leaf
you
have
to
shred
them
pretty
fine
i
can
feel
it
back
there
and
i
hawked
some
phlegm


i
started
tripping
out
on
the
fractalizing
trees
behind
her
head
but
she
said
\x93papy
look
at
me
stay
with
me
and
so
i
did

she
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
crazy
and
i
told
her
not
to
worry
that
everything
was
okay
\x93youre
the
one
love
i
am
never
going
to
leave
you

then
she
dropped
the
first
bombshell
\x93papy
she
said
\x93you
dropped
the
whole
joint
in
your
mouth

\x93what

\x93
and
i
didnt
know
if
you
had
done
it
deliberately
or
not
i
was
going
to
take
it
out
but
then
you
chewed
it
up
a
bit
and
spat
some
out

\x93seriously
no
wonder
my
throat
feels
so
raw

why
did
you
keep
saying
fuck
who
were
you
talking
to

\x93i
was
talking
to
you
except
that
you
had
died
somehow
when
i
went
into
the
trip
you
died
it
was
just
apparent
to
me
that
you
were
dead

\x93how
much
do
you
remember
of
your
experience
she
asked

\x93all
of
it
perfectly
i
said
which
is
kind
of
true
i
remember
my
side
of
it
perfectly

\x93what
was
all
that
rolling
around
on
the
ground
about
she
asked

\x93was
i
rolling
around
on
the
ground
i
asked
baffled
after
that
initial
surge
of
relief
i
now
experienced
an
acute
wave
of
paranoia
i
was
so
glad
she
wasnt
dead
but
realized
i
had
probably
been
shouting
my
side
of
the
conversation
outside
for
the
whole
world
to
hear
thats
the
kind
of
behaviour
that
gets
you
committed
to
the
insane
asylum
for
sure
\x93can
we
please
go
inside
right
now
i
ask
not
waiting
for
a
reply
and
just
running
inside
all
freaked
out
hoping
the
cops
wouldnt
come
knocking
at
my
door
which
i
closed
and
locked

we
sat
down
and
began
to
piece
together
our
different
versions
of
what
happened
i
was
quite
surprised
at
how
different
our
two
accounts
were
my
partner
was
super
shaken
she
had
thought
that
my
mind
had
broken
and
that
i
wasnt
going
to
come
out
of
this
trip
that
she
would
be
dead
to
me
hereafter
it
took
a
while
of
reassurances
and
me
talking
sanely
to
convince
her
i
wasnt
permanently
loco
i
also
came
clean
about
my
using
mdma
the
last
couple
days
which
was
nice
i
had
that
sense
of
clarity
to
realize
that
lying
stealthiness
or
sneakiness
get
me
nowhere
they
are
entirely
counterproductive
i
asked
her
how
loud
i
had
been
had
i
been
shouting
she
said
it
wasnt
that
loud
also
of
the
stuff
i
said
to
her
in
my
trip
only
some
of
it
did
i
actually
say
out
loud
i
also
apparently
said
some
stuff
that
i
dont
remember
at
all

this
seems
a
good
place
to
start
my
partners
side
of
the
story
how
things
actually
happened
the
first
two
tokes
are
the
same
in
both
versions
of
the
story
it
is
on
the
third
toke
that
they
diverge
from
one
another
in
my
version
i
take
a
third
drag
not
feeling
much
yet
in
actuality
i
was
already
inside
of
the
experience
without
knowing
it
extremely
fast
transition


my
partner
said
it
looked
like
i
was
going
to
take
a
third
toke
i
brought
the
doobie
close
to
my
mouth
paused
a
bit
and
then
dropped
the
whole
fucking
thing
into
my
mouth
this
is
why
i
said
not
smart
to
smoke
a
dmt
joint
while
lying
down
apparently
i
chewed
it
up
and
spat
out
a
little
but
i
ate
the
filter
for
sure
and
probably
a
good
chunk
of
the
joint
as
well
gross
no
wonder
it
tasted
so
bad

then
apparently
i
crawled
around
on
the
ground
for
awhile
kneeding
the
earth
spastically
she
asked
me
what
i
was
doing
and
apparently
i
replied
\x93rolling
around
on
the
ground
and
having
fun
i
have
no
recollection
of
this
and
i
certainly
wasnt
having
any
fun

\x93do
you
remember
me
restraining
you
she
asked

\x93what
i
said
again
\x93no

she
said
i
kept
grabbing
the
ground
and
her
flesh
as
well
pulling
with
a
strong
force
i
got
pretty
forceful
when
i
was
trying
to
take
of
my
pants
and
do
her
she
apparently
told
me
\x93i
dont
want
to
have
sex
right
now
you
dont
even
know
who
i
am

\x93yes
i
do
i
said
again
i
have
no
recollection
of

\x93who
am
i
then
whats
my
name
all
i
could
do
was
stare
blankly
she
tried
again

\x93do
you
know
who
star
our
very
close
friend
is
i
continued
to
stare
blankly
getting
forceful
again
apparently
and
she
pushed
me
to
the
ground
she
must
have
been
absolutely
terrified
thinking
i
had
just
gone
mad
forever
she
said
sometimes
i
would
look
into
her
eyes
almost
lucid
but
then
would
just
zone
out
again

integration

i
was
in
the
trance
state
a
long
time
probably
10-12
minutes
acid
tends
to
lengthen
the
effects
of
dmt
and
mdma
definitely
reduces
the
threshold
to
breakthrough
my
partner
suggested
that
my
body
might
have
been
possessed
by
spirits
while
i
was
in
the
trance
state
certainly
this
is
possible
having
sudden
intense
finger
strength
and
saying
stuff
i
dont
remember
while
experiencing
something
totally
different
from
the
world
around
me
having
uncontrollable
sexual
compulsions
could
also
just
be
my
mind
working
on
a
sub-conscious
level
my
conscious
mind
being
totally
involved
in
a
terrifying
experience
activating
some
primative
survival
pathways
in
the
mind

the
way
everything
turned
to
black
in
my
vision
when
the
joint
hit
the
back
of
my
mouth
makes
me
wonder
if
a
nasty
entity
snuck
its
way
into
the
joint
between
sessions
its
pretty
odd
to
drop
a
joint
in
your
mouth
i
remember
doing
it
only
once
before
in
all
my
years
of
pot
smoking
the
way
the
blackness
in
my
vision
spread
was
like
a
mold
or
a
disease
contaminant
of
some
kind
i
also
pondered
whether
the
woman
i
had
been
interacting
with
was
my
real
partner
possibly
another
entity
could
take
on
her
form
and
appearance
in
order
to
trick
me
and
try
to
gain
control
over
me
reminder
to
self
specifically
state
only
entities
who
are
friendly
benevolent
and
helpful
are
invited

by
the
time
we
were
finished
discussing
my
partner
was
pretty
calm
i
however
was
trying
to
come
to
terms
with
what
i
had
experienced
i
began
to
worry
fearing
that
some
aspect
of
my
vision
might
actually
be
true
that
she
would
die
maybe
not
soon
but
a
whole
lot
sooner
than
me
and
that
i
would
have
to
live
my
life
without
her
afraid
that
maybe
somehow
i
had
actually
killed
her
through
my
actions
talk
about
unforseen
consequences
of
drug
use
i
was
freaked
out
and
then
some

it
took
a
long
hot
bath
a
lot
of
crying
and
a
cup
of
jasmine
tea
before
i
calmed
down
a
little
coming
out
of
the
craziest
scariest
and
most
harrowing
dmt
trip
i
have
ever
had
peaking
on
four
hits
of
acid
and
200
mg
of
mdma
seemed
pretty
tame
in
comparison
the
emotional
shock
was
just
that
shocking
i
was
overwhelmed
by
my
experience
trying
to
wrap
my
mind
around
it
and
failing

time
went
on
and
we
went
home
and
ate
some
nice
grounding
food
i
hadnt
eaten
in
a
long
time
i
slowly
came
back
to
being
okay
i
decided
that
it
is
not
within
my
power
by
smoking
dmt
to
kill
another
individual
certainly
it
is
within
my
power
to
believe
i
have
killed
another
person
while
under
the
influence
what
can
be
really
frightening
about
these
sorts
of
trips
in
dmt
space
is
that
it
feels
absolutely
vividly
real
while
you
are
there
more
real
than
real
almost

i
realized
though
that
it
does
not
matter
whether
what
i
saw
is
\x93real
or
not
we
live
our
lives
the
same
regardless
whether
we
die
today
or
in
sixty
years
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
and
no
way
to
know
the
outcome
before
it
happens
all
we
can
do
is
live
our
lives
fully
in
each
moment
of
every
day
i
wondered
why
i
had
been
shown
this
vision
if
dmt
is
a
teacher
medicine
then
i
should
be
learning
lessons
from
this
experience
i
guess
too
if
she
were
to
die
this
gives
me
a
reference
point
for
that
experience
dmt
teaches
us
a
lot
about
the
death
process
leraning
to
let
go
smoothly
i
dont
believe
that
what
i
saw
is
real
however
not
everything
you
see
and
hear
in
dmt
space
is
real
or
reliable
a
lot
is
trickery
illusion
or
something
shown
so
that
you
can
grow
from
it
i
question
everything
that
i
see
in
dmt
space
i
feel
i
was
shown
my
biggest
fear
through
this
experience
the
fear
of
being
alone

in
retrospect
i
dont
regret
this
experience
it
was
hard
for
a
while
seeing
what
i
had
and
knowing
there
is
no
way
to
go
back
in
time
to
before
you
went
through
the
experience
if
i
wasnt
ready
for
the
experience
then
it
wouldnt
have
come
to
me
that
said
i
do
not
ever
want
to
go
back
to
that
particular
place
some
trips
you
have
once
so
you
know
that
type
of
trip
is
possible
and
then
you
dont
need
to
have
it
again
i
couldnt
sleep
that
night
still
feeling
freaked
out
and
i
wrote
the
bulk
of
this
report
to
let
it
out
of
my
mind
and
gain
some
peace
pushing
45
hours
awake
and
the
sleep
deprivation
hallucinations
were
kicking
in

addendum
it
has
been
two
months
since
this
experience
it
has
been
a
challenging
experience
to
integrate
i
would
say
i
am
about
three
quarters
of
the
way
through
the
integration
process
the
experience
was
so
real
that
just
thinking
about
it
is
enough
to
get
my
heart
pounding
i
was
left
with
a
lot
of
fear
a
lot
of
lingering
dread
that
what
i
experienced
was
real
i
am
learning
an
important
lesson
how
to
live
my
life
in
love
and
not
in
fear
i
have
to
choose
day
by
day
to
let
go
of
the
fear
i
have
to
choose
to
live
in
love
and
be
happy

i
have
had
one
\x93flashback
to
this
experience
i
had
been
at
an
intentional
dance
that
day
a
guided
dance
where
we
would
bring
up
and
express
different
emotions
such
as
fear
ecstasy
anger
and
so
on
this
guided
dance
had
brought
my
fears
to
the
surface
later
that
night
we
ate
some
mushrooms
with
a
capsule
of
harmala
alkaloids
when
these
substances
came
on
i
experienced
a
moment
of
pure
fear
i
worried
again
that
what
i
had
seen
might
somehow
be
true
my
body
actually
went
into
shock
and
i
got
really
chilled
and
shaky
though
challenging
this
was
a
good
process
to
go
through
i
feel
that
by
bringing
up
the
fear
i
was
able
to
start
letting
go
of
it
realizing
how
irrational
fear
is
i
was
able
to
face
my
fear
and
allow
it
to
pass
over
and
through
me

i
have
not
felt
called
to
work
with
dmt
since
the
trip
i
dont
feel
i
can
have
a
new
experience
until
i
finish
integrating
this
one
i
did
roll
a
small
joint
with
just
a
little
bit
of
dmt
the
other
day
with
the
intention
of
understanding
my
relation
to
the
substance
and
to
let
go
of
my
fears
i
choose
a
calming
natural
setting
and
took
a
couple
puffs
just
enough
to
be
aware
of
the
energy
flow
nowhere
near
a
breakthrough
dose
i
could
see
the
trees
around
me
dancing
again
but
was
lucid
enough
to
know
the
reality
behind
the
dancing
trees
the
trees
themselves
are
real
but
my
perception
of
them
is
very
malleable
this
is
what
dmt
does
it
plays
with
my
perceptions
what
i
experience
in
dmt
space
is
a
construct
of
my
own
mind
it
does
not
have
its
own
reality
all
dmt
can
do
is
show
me
things
it
shows
me
aspects
of
my
mind
but
does
not
create
reality
that
is
comforting

one
thing
i
keep
coming
back
to
is
respect
respect
for
the
medicine
is
crucial
set
setting
and
intent
are
crucial
i
was
in
a
pretty
dark
place
when
i
had
that
scary
trip
pushing
myself
too
hard
and
abusing
mdma
again
had
my
preparation
and
intent
been
more
solid
perhaps
i
wouldnt
have
needed
such
a
harrowing
trip
dmt
is
an
extremely
powerful
substance
and
i
had
been
using
it
recklessly
and
in
combination
with
other
drugs
i
respect
its
power
a
lot
more
now

this
was
a
very
powerful
learning
experience
for
me
i
feel
one
aspect
of
the
experience
does
ring
true
my
partner
is
the
one
this
experience
showed
me
clearly
our
connection
and
what
i
would
feel
if
i
lost
her
doing
mdma
sneakily
behind
her
back
generally
disrespecting
myself
and
her
as
well
is
not
a
healthy
place
to
be
in
it
makes
me
truly
grateful
for
my
ordinary
everday
life
truly
grateful
to
live
in
love
with
this
wonderful
woman
dmt
is
a
teacher
and
this
harsh
lesson
was
there
to
nudge
me
back
on
my
path

thanks
for
reading
may
you
live
each
moment
of
every
day
to
its
fullest
choosing
to
live
in
love
and
not
in
fear




this
report
documents
my
experiences
with
the
combination
of
smoked
dmt
and
5-meo-dmt
i
am
male
at
the
time
of
the
experiences
i
was
23
years
old
weighing
125
pounds
i
am
well
versed
in
botanical
fungal
and
chemical
entheogens
before
these
experiences
i
had
become
familiar
with
both
dmt
and
5-meo-dmt
at
doses
ranging
from
light
to
being
annihilated
by
white
light
my
experiences
with
these
tryptamines
had
been
variously
beautiful
terrifying
subtle
and
overwhelming
taken
separately
i
find
that
dmt
tended
towards
the
beautiful
and
5-meo-dmt
towards
the
uncomfortable
both
together
is
something
else
again

over
a
four
week
period
i
experimented
several
times
with
a
combination
of
the
two
substances
searching
to
know
myself
deeper
and
gain
personal
insights
as
if
either
dmt
or
5-meo-dmt
arent
intense
enough
on
their
own
smoking
the
two
together
is
a
one-two
knock-out
this
is
as
far
out
as
i
have
journeyed
using
any
substance
or
technique
it
is
truly
beyond
the
beyond
i
will
present
my
original
notes
edited
for
clarity
and
with
any
added
commentary
within
square
brackets

of
a
mixture

roughly

parts
dmt
and
5-meo-dmt

set
and
setting
hiking
with
gemini
in
the
mountains
on
a
sunny
early
spring
day
we
had
wandered
off
the
trail
following
the
edge
of
this
small
lake
drawn
towards
a
sunny
ridge
we
werent
disappointed
discovering
a
small
round
bowl
of
land
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
it
would
have
been
swampy
in
the
bottom
in
summer
but
right
now
it
was
filled
with
snow
and
the
tracks
of
deer
elk
and
coyotes
scrubby
willows
and
aspen
rise
from
the
low
areas
and
a
pine
forest
rings
us
with
the
snowy
mountain
peaks
towering
overhead
i
find
a
sunny
sheltered
spot
a
piece
of
dry
hillside
under
a
cluster
of
three
pine
trees
grass
bearberry
and
fallen
needles
cover
a
comfortable
area
for
sitting
down

it
was
a
touch
breezy
for
a
normal
lighter
but
conveniently
gemini
had
brought
his
jet
lighter
with
him
once
i
had
found
the
appropriate
method
and
distance
at
which
to
hold
the
lighter
it
vaporized
my
chemical
concoction
quite
nicely
i
took
a
full
lungful
of
white
vapours
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
inhaling
gemini
put
on
a
song
on
his
phone
which
actually
has
extraordinarly
good
sound
considering
its
just
a
phone
the
song
was
\x93hold
tight
london
by
the
chemical
brothers
perfect
musical
accompaniment
for
the
moment

the
tryptamine
flash
hit
me
strong
and
hard
and
beautiful
i
breathed
deeply
feeling
the
energy
and
letting
it
flow
through
me
smoothly
and
unimpeded
i
felt
a
union
with
the
forest
and
the
mountains
around
me
the
forest
i
could
feel
as
one
large
consciousness
and
the
mountains
overlooking
as
stern
protectors
it
was
a
very
peaceful
feeling
more
pleasant
than
diving
in
an
inside
artificial
environment
it
is
hard
to
be
overwhelmed
in
nature
or
i
can
be
overwhelmed
but
its
comfortable
trees
and
grass
and
sunshine

i
began
to
drop
out
of
the
initial
flash
but
this
combination
is
a
tricky
one
when
i
think
im
starting
to
come
down
that
is
when
the
5-meo
really
gets
to
me
i
find
the
reintegration
period
on
5-meo-dmt
is
usually
difficult
as
the
psychedelic
effects
continue
for
longer
than
dmt
does
5-meo-dmt
has
such
a
high
energy
high
vibration
that
it
is
easy
for
me
to
feel
overloaded
if
i
begin
to
clamp
down
on
that
energy
vibration
or
try
to
reintegrate
and
think
normally
too
soon
then
the
excess
energy
gets
transferred
into
bodily
discomfort
nausea
slight
dizzyness
sometimes
an
anxious
feeling
this
time
in
the
natural
setting
i
faired
well
with
the
residual
effects
i
stayed
in
a
meditative
state
much
of
the
time
and
grounded
the
energy

i
was
staring
up
at
the
mountain
overlooking
us
it
felt
like
i
was
talking
to
the
mountain
without
words
both
of
us
becoming
aware
of
the
other
as
this
happened
a
cool
and
playful
wind
came
whipping
down
on
us
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
wind
was
coming
right
down
off
the
mountain
tops
bringing
with
it
the
scent
of
ice
and
snow
the
mountain
was
talking
back
telling
me
its
own
story
of
lofty
heights
jagged
rock
and
sparkling
wind-packed
snowdrifts

we
lazed
around
for
quite
a
lot
longer
in
the
sun
as
i
slowly
pieced
myself
back
together
gemini
smoked
a
couple
bowls
of
hash
after
staring
in
amazement
at
the
way
everything
glowed
in
the
vibrant
sunshine
i
finally
accepted
a
toke
or
two
of
hash
myself
i
was
left
with
a
nice
afterglow
from
the
5-meo/dmt
mixture
my
mood
was
very
positive
and
i
was
enjoying
being
out
in
the
sun
and
nature
so
much
as
usual
i
felt
hungry
after
coming
down
raiding
the
bag
of
pistachios
wed
brought
along
afterwards
we
continued
our
hike
round
the
lake
then
eventually
made
our
way
to
the
nearest
mountain
town
for
an
satisfying
feast
of
burgers
not
the
fast
food
kind
and
beer

2008
evening

roughly
equal
parts
dmt
and
5-meo-dmt
one
hit
is
definitely
enough
setting
my
room
comfortable
environment
with
dim
light
music
and
a
pillow
at
my
back
for
support
mindset
curious
to
try
this
combination
again

immediate
impression
there
are
no
words
for
this
combination
ive
learned
that
it
is
best
for
me
to
try
not
to
come
out
of
the
trance
state
too
soon
when
the
initial
dmt
flash
begins
to
fade
is
when
the
5-methoxy
grabs
me
by
the
balls
thats
when
i
got
the
fear
focussing
everything
on
letting
the
energy
flow
through
me
into
the
ground
grounding

i
purged
again
[as
i
had
recently
done
after
smoking
just
dmt]
when
i
came
down
i
reintegrated
too
soon
and
it
overloaded
me
with
energy
the
space
of
clarity
i
had
gotten
into
was
too
much
to
try
to
put
back
in
the
old
box
dmt
is
the
light
and
5-meo
the
power

[
after
a
little
more
integration
time]

i
think
i
blasted
off
at
723
and
its
now
758
apparently
after
giving
myself
a
little
time
for
integration
there
are
words
for
the
experience
after
all
the
combination
lasts
a
lot
longer
than
dmt
does
it
was
that
second
wave
the
5-meo
that
really
got
me

for
music
i
was
playing
\x93oleander
by
bluetech
though
honestly
i
wasnt
at
all
aware
of
the
music
as
the
internal
state
was
too
involving
soothing
background
sound
anyway
a
hypnotic
and
beautiful
piece
of
ambient
dub


at
first
it
was
the
typical
tryptamine
flash
fractalizing
and
folding
up
the
addition
of
the
5-meo
adds
a
blinding
white
light
to
the
scene
and
any
thought
of
not
\x93breaking
through
is
washed
away
by
the
intensity
i
was
simply
annihilated


as
i
began
to
come
out
of
the
flash
i
started
thinking
too
much
thinking
about
my
setting
in
my
parents
house
i
am
no
longer
comfortable
letting
go
completely
here
maybe
i
never
have
been
this
is
extremely
important
i
have
to
be
able
to
let
go
fully
to
engage
the
trance
state
in
a
positive
manner

at
moments
i
was
getting
it
just
tapped
in
to
that
immense
energy
i
held
my
hands
over
the
ground
letting
it
all
flow
through
me
and
into
the
earth
i
reached
a
space
of
absolute
clarity
i
could
feel
distinctly
what
was
holding
me
back
and
what
i
needed
to
do
to
move
past
what
was
holding
me
back

as
i
came
down
i
was
flipping
in
and
out
of
the
\x93tapped
in
lightning
rod
feeling
each
time
i
lost
the
calm
trance
i
became
anxious
and
would
have
all
these
worries
run
through
my
head
i
need
to
get
out
of
this
house
was
an
overwhelming
feeling
things
will
be
better
when
i
move
out
i
felt
an
intense
empathy
and
gratefulness
for
a
friend
of
mine
thinking
that
she
would
be
able
to
weather
this
kind
of
intensity
just
fine
i
wanted
to
call
her
talk
with
her
when
i
came
down
from
the
tryptamine
flash

there
was
a
definate
breaking
point
to
the
energy
i
coughed
this
was
a
sign
of
my
body
fighting
back
reintegrating
it
was
too
much
that
coughing
purging
again
just
like
the
last
couple
times
its
partially
a
cleansing
partially
me
just
being
overwhelmed
by
the
residual
5-methoxy
energy

that
smell
tells
you

same
setting
same
mixture
of
roughly
equal
portions
dmt
and
5-meo-dmt
as
last
time
no
clear
intention
it
just
felt
right
pursuant
to
yesterdays
experience
i
guess

for
music
i
played
\x93lost
and
found
just
the
last
3-4
minutes
by
the
orb
followed
by
oleander
by
bluetech
i
wanted
to
use
this
song
again
to
keep
the
setting
consistent
followed
finally
by
\x93let
the
music
set
you
free
by
the
orb
i
had
been
consuming
lots
of
a
kratom
and
yerba
mate
tea
before
the
experience
which
possibly
had
some
influence
[my
experiences
lead
me
to
hypothesize
that
kratom
particularly
can
increase
my
receptiveness
to
smoked
tryptamines]
initially
the
low
dose
of
dmt
left
me
in
contact
with
my
body
and
breathing
freely
but
as
the
5-meo
seeped
in
that
sensation
of
my
body
became
more
and
more
distant

the
first
three
to
four
minutes
i
was
indeed
lost
and
did
not
find
myself
until
the
song
changed
during
this
phase
i
had
sensations
of
pressure
all
over
my
body
but
particularly
in
the
stomach/solar
plexus
region
the
key
to
not
being
overwhelmed
is
to
feel
dont
shy
away
from
or
resist
the
unpleasant
tension
in
my
stomach
feel
it
as
i
feel
it
the
nature
changes
and
it
becomes
manageable
just
intense
energization
eyes
are
closed

i
was
aware
of
the
song
change
entering
a
new
phase
in
which
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
breathing
heavily
as
the
waves
came
over
me
i
kept
being
directed
into
certain
body
positions
as
i
sat
cross
legged
one
was
to
let
my
head
drop
precipitiously
forward
and
then
bouncing
up
and
down
slightly
like
a
spring
this
seemed
to
form
a
\x93wave
that
put
me
in
communication
with
something
the
waving
motion
of
my
head
was
important
when
coming
out
of
the
\x93wave
i
would
have
to
lean
my
head
all
the
way
back
and
my
breathing
would
become
heavy
as
the
intensity
of
effects
would
shoot
up
a
notch


anytime
i
moved
my
head
it
would
create
a
wave
of
dizzyness
moving
my
body
more
was
out
of
the
question
as
this
would
have
led
to
nausea
due
to
the
extreme
dizzyness
the
dizzyness
was
part
of
the
trip
though
somehow
i
made
some
strange
repetitive
humming
noises
that
seemed
necessary
at
the
time
the
effects
during
this
period
were
very
similar
to
say
a
quarter
oz
of
strong
fungus
i
kept
trancing
out
with
the
waves
and
with
eyes
now
open
crawling
visuals
were
everywhere

ten
or
eleven
minutes
had
elasped
since
blastoff
as
the
song
changed
again
this
was
around
when
i
became
integrated
with
my
body
a
third
phase
coming
down
i
would
like
to
comment
on
duration
of
the
experience
if
i
smoke
just
dmt
i
get
a
2-3
minute
\x93flash
and
come
out
of
the
trance
state
after
5-7
minutes
when
i
smoke
the
combination
of
dmt
and
5-meo-dmt
i
stay
in
the
flash
for
3-4
minutes
and
come
out
of
the
trance
after
10-11
minutes
so
for
me
adding
the
5-meo-dmt
lengthens
the
effects
and
increases
the
potency
i
hypothesize
that
the
effects
of
this
mixture
are
simply
additive
not
truly
synergistic
[eg
in
the
case
of
the
harmala
alkaloids]
adding
15
mg
of
5-meo-dmt
to
15
of
dmt
is
quite
strong
simply
because
of
the
higher
potency
of
the
5-meo-dmt

within
fifteen
minutes
of
blastoff
i
was
down
enough
to
move
around
without
getting
dizzy
and
to
start
writing
this
report
song
lyrics
seem
appropriate
\x93that
smell
tells
you
yes
yes
it
does
that
burnt
tryptamine
smell
so
distinctive
\x93if
the
music
sets
you
free
then
let
it
be
love
is
the
answer
only
love
can
conquer

substance
setting
and
music
same
as
last
time
mindset
emotionally
distraught
struggling
with
my
feelings
of
love
for
this
girl
jess
recently
home
from
having
seen
her
and
having
the
issue
been
brought
up
again
it
is
difficult
for
me
feeling
love
for
a
woman
who
is
marrying
another
man

intention
looking
for
guidance
resolution
insight
or
even
just
forgetfulness
and
sleep
i
had
a
fatalistic
attitude
feeling
so
upset
inside
that
for
once
i
had
no
fear
going
into
the
experience
whatever
happened
it
couldnt
possibly
be
more
uncomfortable
than
what
i
was
feeling
already
could
it
i
was
not
scared
because
i
did
not
really
care
what
happened
to
me

it
took
three
inhalations

not
one
to
get
a
suitable
\x93flash
this
time
perhaps
i
was
more
psychically
resistant
in
this
mindset
or
perhaps
i
had
simply
loaded
less
material
in
the
pipe
and
did
not
get
that
critical
mass
of
vaporization
to
blast
off
this
time
i
had
a
tension
in
my
stomach
going
into
the
experience
and
as
the
vapours
took
effect
this
tension
eased
somewhat
the
reverse
of
usual

i
asked
for
insight
and
guidance
and
it
came
transferance
feelings
and
an
echo
effect
why
is
this
feeling
i
have
for
jess
so
strong
and
so
crushing
the
last
time
i
felt
this
way
about
a
girl
was
my
ex
with
whom
i
had
an
intense
on
and
off
again
three
year
relationship
having
that
feeling
of
love
again
i
felt
excitement
and
simultaneously
fear
the
fear
goes
deep
i
dont
want
the
same
situation
to
play
out
again
i
dont
want
to
feel
abandonned
and
separated
again
i
was
transfering
some
of
my
feelings
and
emotions
regarding
how
my
relationship
with
my
ex
worked
out
onto
my
relationship
with
jess
similarities
in
the
situations
have
me
subconsciously
generalizing
and
expecting
the
same
outcome
even
though
jess
is
a
different
person
but
it
goes
deeper
than
this

part
of
a
larger
pattern
and
facing
the
core
i
have
placed
myself
again
in
a
situation
of
externalizing
my
happiness
i
have
programmed
myself
so
that
when
i
am
around
jess
i
feel
happy
when
she
interacts
positively
with
me
when
she
smiles
at
me
our
eyes
meet
a
hug
or
a
touch
it
fills
me
with
joy
and
tingles
of
excitement
when
she
seems
distant
or
i
see
her
passion
for
her
fiancee
it
makes
me
feel
crushed
inside
i
feel
the
joy
drained
out
of
me
and
i
become
anxious
listless
and
with
butterflies
in
my
stomach
precluding
eating
the
change
i
have
to
make
is
the
same
i
made
once
before
i
have
to
come
from
a
stable
basis
of
loving
myself
in
order
to
form
a
positive
long-term
relationship
with
jess
i
have
to
let
go
of
the
desire
for
reciprocity

the
situation
with
jess
is
part
of
a
much
larger
picture
i
caught
a
few
glimpses
of
it
the
pieces
are
shifting
the
situation
is
changing
i
felt
i
was
being
brought
face-to-face
with
the
core
of
myself
deep
into
the
primitive
and
fundamental
feelings
and
emotions
driving
me
to
think
feel
and
act
as
i
do
i
am
experiencing
this
feeling
now
with
jess
so
that
i
can
work
through
it
i
will
be
stronger
for
this
experience
and
will
have
gained
a
better
understanding
of
love

three
dimensional
translinguistic
meaning-containing
and
feeling-oriented
self-transforming
structures
of
light
and
colour
i
think
i
finally
get
part
of
what
terence
mckenna
was
on
about
i
could
see
everything
my
\x93situation
as
this
rotating
shifting
object
black
surfaces
edged
in
colours
spinning
round
a
glowing
white
core
the
object
was
a
visual
representation
of
what
i
was
thinking
and
feeling
and
how
the
situation
was
changing
it
contained
information
and
expressed
it
in
a
manner
beyond
words

body
positioning
and
letting
go
as
i
came
out
of
the
flash
i
felt
grief
and
sadness
as
a
pure
and
raw
emotion
for
a
few
moments
i
let
the
feeling
fill
me
completely
i
didnt
resist
whatever
was
most
uncomfortable
and
unpleasant
was
what
i
had
to
open
up
to
and
feel
the
most
intensly
it
obviously
wasnt
a
good
feeling
but
i
felt
strangely
dissociated
from
the
feeling
and
a
calm
core
was
aware
that
things
werent
so
bad
really

i
was
directed
by
the
drugs
and
how
i
was
feeling
into
lying
sideways
in
a
fetal
position
on
the
ground
the
grief
pouring
through
me
was
intensifying
but
i
found
myself
slipping
away
let
go
let
go
let
go
i
did
finally
let
go
the
sadness
and
anxiety
faded
as
my
ego
slipped
away
merging
with
the
ambient
environment
and
now
bathed
in
calmness
and
light

i
came
out
of
this
brief
ego-loss
twitching
and
shivering
i
was
cold
lying
here
on
the
floor
coming
down
a
huge
wave
of
tiredness
washed
over
me
i
decided
i
should
go
straight
to
bed
and
got
up
still
dizzy
unsteady
and
disoriented
i
kept
telling
myself
not
to
loose
the
trance
state
but
by
the
time
i
undressed
and
got
into
bed
and
set
the
alarm
for
the
next
day
and
turned
out
the
light
i
had
lost
the
trance
i
couldnt
get
back
to
that
place
of
ego-loss
it
was
too
late
i
had
integrated
i
got
to
sleep
relatively
easily
which
was
a
blessing
and
was
somewhat
calmer
in
the
morning
though
we
will
see
how
i
feel
the
next
time
im
around
jess

i
need
to
reconnect
with
that
calm
center
within
me
that
center
radiating
peace
and
love
and
joy
simply
for
the
fact
of
existence
i
am
feeling
drawn
towards
cactus
for
trying
to
reconnect
this
way
and
may
pursue
that
path
in
the
near
future

the

same
setting
same
substance
and
similar

as
last
time
mindset
reasonably
calm
reflective
but
not
upset
as
i
had
been
the
day
before
intention
simply
seeing
where
i
might
go

i
loaded
the
last
of
the
mixture
into
the
tube
though
there
was
plenty
of
resin
still
in
there
too
i
took
two
large
inhalations
strangely
not
choking
on
or
feeling
the
vapours
much
this
time
after
one
breath
i
set
the
pipe
down
but
didnt
feel
it
would
take
me
all
the
way
so
i
went
back
for
another

there
are
three
distinct
phases
to
the
experience
this
has
been
consistent
through
all
my
experiences
with
the
mixture
but
became
clear
to
me
only
on
this
trip
the
first
phase
is
the
tryptamine
\x93flash
it
is
during
this
phase
that
i
lost
contact
with
my
body
the
first
time
and
also
despite
having
music
playing
i
am
not
really
consciously
aware
of
it
the
first
song
was
\x93once
upon
the
sea
of
blissful
awareness
by
shpongle
just
about
seven
minutes
long
i
blasted
off
one
minute
into
the
song
and
by
the
last
couple
minutes
was
consciously
aware
of
the
music
again
\x93my
mind
craves
nectar
day
and
night
this
phase
of
the
experience
is
all-involving
and
irrestistably
intense

after
the
first
phase
is
a
false
comedown
a
brief
lull
the
tryptamine
flash
fades
but
a
second
almost
more
powerful
sensation
takes
over
there
are
sensations
of
pressure
and
i
become
aware
of
my
heart
pumping
the
energy
intensifies
heavy
and
thick
threatening
to
overwhelm
me
i
have
to
concentrate
everything
on
breathing
and
letting
the
energy
flow
through
me
into
the
earth
grounding
and
feeling
secure
comfortable
reminding
myself
to
just
flow
and
ride
the
feeling
it
is
this
second
wave
that
can
bring
the
fear
with
it
existential
fear
a
threat
to
my
ego
during
this
phase
information
and
insight
bombards
me

as
the
second
wave
fades
it
leaves
me
in
phase
three
tryptamine
activation
the
effects
are
similar
to
a
really
strong
dose
of
mushrooms
or
lsd
when
you
are
completely
involved
in
the
internal
experience
i
am
often
directed
into
particular
body
positions
that
seem
to
amplify
the
effects
of
the
trance
today
it
was
first
that
head-bobbing-forward-like-a-spring
thing
that
i
discovered
recently
except
this
time
i
was
almost
drooling
and
made
some
interesting
humming
noises
glossolalia
much
after
my
near-drooling
episode
i
was
directed
back
into
the
fetal-egg
position
of
yesterdays
experience

i
found
a
special
significance
in
my
body
positioning
once
curled
up
like
a
fetus
i
began
to
feel
that
i
was
actually
within
a
womb
i
could
feel
a
protective
egg-like
enclosure
all
around
me
and
eventually
began
to
sense
that
i
was
gestating
in
the
stomach
of
the
earth
mother
i
wasnt
ready
to
come
out
yet
not
ready
to
be
born
and
face
the
world
being
in
the
womb
i
felt
warm
safe
secure
i
stayed
in
this
position
for
more
than
twenty
minutes
and
during
this
time
was
able
to
keep
the
tryptamine
trance
state
flowing
there
was
an
endless
flowing
and
recycling
of
tryptamine
love
back
into
me
i
began
to
feel
the
umbilical
cord
connected
through
my
solar
plexus
feeding
me
with
life
energy
at
moments
the
trance
would
jump
a
notch
in
intensity
sending
me
out
of
body
for
the
second
time

slowly
the
trance
state
was
fading
and
normal
thoughts
were
starting
to
seep
back
in
i
found
i
could
rekindle
the
feeling
by
not
getting
sucked
into
my
thoughts
just
feeling
the
mind-warp
finally
after
some
experimental
opening
and
closing
of
my
eyes
i
realized
that
my
arm
was
painfully
asleep
from
lying
on
my
side
for
so
long
moving
stiffly
groaning
i
came
to
impressed
at
how
long
i
was
able
to
maintain
the
trance
this
time

at
t
+
36
minutes
i
was
integrated
enough
to
begin
typing
this
report
though
the
\x93white
computer
screen
still
looks
rainbow
to
me
right
now
still
quite
heavily
effected
it
is
an
exciting
time
i
am
in
a
new
phase
of
gestation
getting
ready
to
be
born
again
what
will
the
world
be
like

that

intention
digging
deeper

i
took
one
large
inhalation
and
as
i
wasnt
being
overwhelmed
right
away
like
i
was
used
to
i
went
back
for
a
second
the
second
was
a
big
one
i
could
see
that
ball
of
brownish
melted
crystals
bubbling
furiously
oops
took
a
little
too
much
perhaps

right
as
i
was
finishing
my
second
inhalation
the
phone
rang
oops
again
clearly
i
wasnt
going
to
be
answering
but
the
ringing
reminded
me
strongly
of
the
normal
world
and
normal
concerns
and
i
became
quite
anxious
as
a
result
i
wasnt
letting
go
like
i
needed
to

there
is
a
certain
aspect
of
5-meo-dmt
that
is
like
being
smacked
across
the
head
with
a
brick
or
perhaps
like
having
the
sun
come
down
from
the
sky
and
crush
me
folding
me
over
and
over
again
like
a
sheet
heavy
heavy
incapacitating
buzz
i
flopped
on
my
side
into
the
fetal
position
again
but
this
provided
no
comfort
i
was
enormously
dizzy
and
the
tension
in
my
stomach
combined
with
the
dizzyness
to
provoke
nausea

i
somehow
ran
to
the
bathroom
in
this
psychedelic
mindstate
and
leaning
over
the
porcelain
alter
purged
and
purged
and
purged
there
was
nothing
in
my
stomach
at
all
i
had
blasted
off
soon
after
getting
up
and
had
eaten
no
breakfast
what
was
coming
out
of
me
was
thick
mucous
or
something
filled
with
the
scent
and
taste
of
5-meo
i
was
reminded
strongly
of
my
ayahuasca
experiences
bleh

i
know
that
the
reason
i
purged
this
time
was
because
i
wasnt
comfortable
letting
go
to
the
experience
the
anxiety
had
to
come
out
as
the
energy
of
5-meo
is
simply
overwhelming
i
overloaded
myself
this
time
it
was
a
pretty
strong
dose
but
i
could
have
handled
it
fine
had
i
remained
calm
and
flowed
with
the
effects

after
the
purge
i
was
still
strongly
effected
but
the
flash
of
the
experience
had
passed
i
was
able
to
sit
meditatively
and
get
into
a
good
state
of
mind
i
felt
cleaned
out
and
did
not
regret
the
experience
in
any
way
though
i
should
have
prepared
my
setting
and
myself
better
before
diving

evening
light
beings

set
and
setting
my
room
nighttime
preloaded
with
a
tea
of
kratom
blue
lotus
yerba
mate
white
pine
sweetgrass
and
sage
energized
and
clearing
good
for
dreaming
intention
manifesting
a
home
for
myself
and
chosen
companions

i
loaded
a
little
dmt
into
the
pipe
but
from
the
taste
and
smell
became
aware
i
was
smoking
quite
a
bit
of
5-meo-dmt
resin
from
the
bottom
of
the
pipe
too
as
i
entered
the
trance
i
became
aware
of
two
entities
on
my
right
hand
side
and
quite
close
was
one
of
the
beings
the
other
was
behind
me
and
on
my
left
side
at
a
little
more
distance
they
felt
very
protective
like
guardians
the
one
close
and
to
my
right
was
bathing
the
side
of
my
head
with
sweeping
motions

the
being
on
my
right
side
started
communicating
with
me
through
flashes
of
light
and
colour
the
fluorescent
light
beside
me
was
being
played
with
being
made
to
flicker
and
flash
in
order
to
communicate
the
beings
sort
of
come
\x93out
of
the
woodwork
the
one
beside
me
was
manifesting
as
part
of
my
bed
the
fluorescent
light
and
part
of
the
floor
he
opened
the
top
of
my
head
and
poured
in
information

i
realized
i
could
open
a
dialogue
with
these
beings
i
could
ask
them
questions
and
they
would
respond
with
these
flashes
of
light-communication
i
told
them
i
wanted
a
home
to
live
in
with
those
i
have
chosen
as
a
new
family
i
told
them
i
want
to
have
a
partner
i
want
her
to
find
me
or
me
to
find
her
i
want
us
to
find
each
other
a
tight
and
beautiful
little
hippy
girl
whose
heart
melts
when
i
look
in
her
eyes
it
doesnt
hurt
to
ask
right
[within
three
weeks
of
this
experience
we
had
a
home
within
two
months
i
had
found
my
sacred
lover
i
got
everything
i
asked
for]

i
was
curious
about
these
entities
remembering
one
dmt
report
saying
that
the
entities
can
have
gender
i
asked
both
if
they
had
a
sex
the
entity
behind
and
on
my
left
seemed
to
indicate
it
was
a
strange
question
to
ask
and
she
dredged
up
some
imagery
for
me
large
breasts
large
hips
direct
stare
a
motherly
figure
the
entity
on
my
right
seemed
amused
by
the
question
as
if
saying
\x93well
we
normally
dont
take
that
form
anymore
but
he
confided
to
being
a
male
if
i
wanted
to
think
about
it
that
way

these
entities
these
light
beings
are
here
for
me
to
protect
me
and
guide
me
as
i
was
coming
out
of
the
trance
state
i
felt
the
desire
to
lie
down
and
asked
that
the
entities
stay
with
me
please
dont
leave
as
i
move
around
i
wish
to
stay
in
contact
with
you
they
heeded
my
call
and
when
i
lay
down
in
bed
i
could
still
sense
that
comforting
flashing
of
light
indicating
their
presence
i
did
some
relaxation/meditation
techniques
that
put
me
deep
into
a
dissociated
state
deep
thinking

thinking
about
eyes
the
eyes
being
the
window
to
the
soul
the
soul
perceives
reality
through
our
eyes
the
patterns
and
colours
in
our
irises
is
a
visual
representation
of
the
frames
and
paradigms
through
which
we
interpret
reality
without
those
pigments
and
patterns
we
would
see
nothing
but
chaos
and
blinding
light
we
have
to
filter
and
make
sense
of
reality
and
this
is
what
you
see
in
peoples
eyes
you
see
how
they
make
sense
of
reality
a
friend
told
me
of
a
new
band
appearing
in
her
eye
which
would
be
a
new
mode
or
paradigm
for
viewing
reality

eventually
i
drifted
easily
into
sleep
my
dreams
that
night
were
vivid
meaningful
and
i
had
better
recollection
that
i
normally
do
dreaming
of
being
in
some
kind
of
crowd
or
festival
and
seeing
jess
from
a
distance
sitting
up
in
a
truck
i
blow
a
kiss
her
way
she
smiles
and
waves
at
the
friends
around
me
but
does
not
seem
to
see
me
at
all
there
is
a
feeling
of
loneliness
and
separation

evening
salvia
preloading
for
smoking
dmt/5-meo

id
first
given
three
attempts
at
breaking
through
on
just
dmt
each
time
i
bounced
off
the
edges
of
the
trance
state
not
achieving
liftoff
velocity
there
is
at
first
a
rising
tone
and
feeling
but
if
i
dont
make
it
through
then
this
quickly
changes
to
a
sensation
of
dropping
and
grounding
out
the
doses
left
me
functional
enough
to
move
around
without
falling
over
which
was
good
because
the
main
effect
seemed
to
be
purgative
i
coughed
and
hacked
all
kinds
of
sickness
out
of
me
it
was
cleansing
but
didnt
take
me
where
where
i
was
trying
to
go
i
wanted
to
break
through
tonight

felt
a
strange
calling
towards
salvia
knowing
subconsciously
where
the
bag
of
leaves
was
and
not
needing
to
search
for
it
simply
reaching
behind
me
and
pulling
it
out
of
the
hidey-hole
it
has
been
many
months
since
i
last
danced
the
divinorum
at
this
time
i
was
still
feeling
the
afterglow
from
the
dmt

i
took
two
large
dry
leaves
and
folded
them
placing
between
my
cheek
and
gum
slowly
they
soften
and
can
be
chewed
slippery
salvia
saliva
tastes
bitter
like
chewing
green
tea
i
spat
the
quid
and
liquid
out
when
it
seemed
appropriate
after
several
minutes
of
chewing
a
perceptual
shift
was
becoming
increasingly
evident
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
what
exactly
had
changed
perhaps
a
little
of
that
salvia
gravity
was
becoming
noticeable

so
i
loaded
a
little
bit
of
mixed
dmt
and
5-meo-dmt
into
the
pipe
and
i
do
mean
just
a
little
bit
tiny
grains
after
filling
my
lungs
there
was
no
doubt
about
achieving
liftoff
this
time
the
oncoming
rush
was
annihilating
me
and
i
think
i
became
quite
panicked
resisting
the
onset

things
are
a
little
fuzzy
in
my
recollection
here
but
i
ended
up
on
the
bed
sideways
being
twisted
and
pulled
into
the
blankets
i
was
twitching
and
rolling
around
a
lot
that
i
remember
clearly
the
twisting
sideways
sensation
i
would
attribute
to
the
salvia
the
emotional
tone
of
the
experience
was
one
of
fear
fear
and
a
sense
of
illusion
of
trickery
and
something
somewhere
laughing
at
my
predicament
for
me
adding
dmt
to
5-meo-dmt
shifted
the
tone
of
5-meo
from
terror
to
bliss
adding
salvia
to
the
mix
seemed
to
reverse
the
effect
dredging
me
down
into
terror
with
an
irrestistable
gravitational
vacuuming

the
effects
lasted
a
long
time
i
cant
say
exactly
how
long
but
it
took
a
good
30
to
45
minutes
before
i
would
consider
myself
\x93integrated
again
the
afterglow
of
the
tryptamines
combined
with
sublingual
salvia
left
me
slipping
and
being
pulled
through
damp
thought
corridors
at
high
speeds
dancing
auroras
of
light
and
energy
surrounded
me
the
feeling
was
oddly
dream-like
and
unreal
when
i
finally
came
out
of
the
trance
i
was
drenched
in
sweat
sleep
came
easily
and
my
dreams
were
extremely
vivid
all
night

using
chewed
salvia
before
smoking
the
tryptamines
seemed
to
destroy
the
lucidity
and
clarity
of
the
tryptamine
flash
i
have
difficulty
bringing
anything
back
from
this
experience
it
was
certainly
intense
but
im
hesitant
to
try
again

[]
thats
all
folks
thanks
for
reading
you
might
ask
what
impact
did
these
experiences
have
on
me
i
feel
they
gave
me
guidance
and
insight
at
a
time
when
i
was
feeling
lost
lonely
and
anxious
they
are
life
affirming
experiences
showing
me
glimpses
of
the
unplumbed
depths
of
my
mind
as
the
late
great
terence
mckenna
said
\x93the
imagination
the
inside
of
our
heads
really
is
the
most
vast
frontier
imaginable

reminding
me
everything
that
happens
is
within
the
highest
good
reminding
me
to
trust
my
heart
and
intuition
to
have
a
comfortable
experience
i
must
accept
that
i
am
experiencing
what
i
need
to
experience
i
must
surrender
to
the
flow
of
life
letting
go
of
the
fear
inherent
in
diving
so
deep
leaves
me
instead
profoundly
open
to
giving
and
receiving
love




friday
1300
after
about
a
week
of
planning
my
\x93dealer
and
i
are
getting
ready
to
embark
on
an
adventure
of
epic
proportions
we
pack
the
car
and
do
a
final
check
of
essentials
we
plan
to
attend
a
psytrance/music
festival
and
consume

lastly
6
bumps
of
k

1500
we
arrived
set
up
tent
etc
and
consume
2
grams
of
mushrooms
each
they
come
on
fairly
quick
and
seem
to
be
nice
and
mellow
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
was
spent
hiking
in
the
mountains
surrounding
the
venue
we
meditated
on
a
rock
at
sunset
and
i
felt
good
about
obliterating
my
mind

1830
upon
returning
to
our
tent
the
music
had
started
and
i
was
feeling
very
cool
my
mind
was
at
ease
and
my
body
felt
good
i
had
not
had
many
visuals
yet
we
consumed
another
3
grams
of
mushrooms
each
and
3
tabs
of
lsd
we
decided
to
go
explore
the
dance
area
i
could
feel
both
the
lsd
and
the
mushrooms
fighting
for
dominance
and
had
to
lie
down
i
explained
to
my
friend
\x93dealer
who
i
will
call
d
from
here
on

i
found
a
soft
spot
and
lay
back
as
my
body
hit
the
ground
it
felt
as
though
everything
was
sinking
in
beneath
me
in
a
good
way
as
waves
of
euphoria
and
that
tingly
acid
sensation
washed
over
my
body
i
have
no
idea
how
long
i
lay
there
but
i
traversed
time
and
space
in
my
mind
i
was
soaring
with
nebulas
and
dancing
with
the
cosmos
i
eventually
felt
energetic
and
jumped
up
a
head
rush
followed
that
can
only
be
described
as
my
soul
trying
to
pop
out
my
skull


+-
2100

i
found
d
after
roaming
around
like
a
madman
for
i
dont
know
how
long
he
was
happy
to
see
me
and
handed
me
2
more
tabs
of
acid
and
gave
me
a
cap
of
2c-b
i
downed
them
all
we
went
for
another
walk
up
the
mountains
it
was
pitch
dark
so
we
needed
to
bring
a
torch
the
torchlight
on
the
grass
was
insane
it
kept
jumping
up
and
dancing
in
the
sky

we
reached
the
rock
we
had
meditated
at
earlier
and
i
needed
to
sit
down
as
i
was
feeling
a
little
woozy
as
i
looked
around
everything
seemed
a
lot
more
\x93evil
than
it
was
earlier
even
ds
demeanor
had
changed
i
asked
him
something
and
he
just
mumbled
back
i
had
a
sudden
fear
that
a
demon
or
something
had
dragged
me
here
to
this
rock
i
kept
seeing
flashes
of
blood
splattered
every
where
and
i
swore
i
could
hear
myself
scream
i
was
breathing
very
heavily
and
d
said
i
should
sit
down
he
took
out
some
mdma
and
said
we
should
sniff
some
to
clear
the
bad
vibes

i
sniffed
2
medium
sized
lines
and
almost
instantly
felt
like
a
purple
cloud
had
descended
on
me
everything
was
so
happy
and
different
to
how
it
was
not
2
minutes
earlier
i
could
talk
easier
and
we
even
hugged
for
a
few
minutes
we
began
talking
about
our
lives
and
how
him
and
i
are
so
different
yet
are
the
same
people
on
psychedelics
i
swear
i
could
feel
his
thoughts
at
this
point
i
tried
to
explore
this
more
but
got
a
very
sharp
metallic
taste
in
my
mouth
and
an
intense
headache
we
decided
we
needed
some
water
and
headed
back
to
the
tent

0100
we
are
back
at
the
tent
and
there
are
a
few
other
people
sitting
around
talking
to
the
other
people
we
met
there
i
was
surprised
at
how
easy
i
was
talking
to
people
eventually
d
decided
we
should
all
smoke
some
dmt
i
have
only
done
it
twice
before
and
was
a
bit
unsure
but
we
went
into
the
tent
and
he
took
out
a
pipe
a
lighter
and
a
small
baggie
of
dmt
he
said
i
should
go
first
he
held
the
pipe
and
lit
the
small
amount
of
dmt
sitting
on
top
of
some
parsley
looking
stuff
i
inhaled
deeply
the
first
taste
was
the
distinctly
acrid
plasticy
taste
of
dmt
i
almost
vomited
but
managed
to
keep
it
all
in
i
exhaled
but
before
the
smoke
had
even
left
my
mouth
i
could
feel
the
pull
of
the
floor


the
tent
swirled
like
ice
cream
at
a
parlour
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
engulfed
in
whiteness
and
marbled
lines
like
the
architecture
of
a
distant
world
far
beyond
our
understanding
i
could
hear
singing/ringing
everywhere
and
could
hear
my
name
although
it
wasnt
but
i
simply
recognized
it
as
my
name
it
was
a
womans
voice
and
i
tried
to
locate
it
but
there
were
patterns
swirling
everywhere
in
my
vision
it
was
getting
hard
to
focus
on
anything
for
longer
than
a
second
before
it
moved
away
there
were
pulsating
not
correct
word
but
closest
to
what
i
saw
colours
everywhere
bright
yellows
and
oranges
they
were
changing
shades
and
eventually
i
managed
to
move
past
them
and
was
met
by
a
massive
tower
like
structure
the
womans
voice
was
coming
from
inside
the
tower
i
tried
to
walk
but
was
held
back
by
something
the
colours
were
fading
and
as
i
turned
to
see
what
it
was
the
tent
became
clear
again
i
remember
sitting
up
and
i
was
sweating
quite
a
bit
i
relaxed
for
the
next
10
minutes
trying
to
understand
what
was
going
on
i
tried
to
write
down
the
experience
in
point
form
but
lost
interest
half
way
through

0145
i
thanked
d
and
left
the
tent
to
go
walk
around
as
i
was
leaving
d
shouted
and
asked
if
i
wanted
more
drugs
i
said
i
would
take
some
with
me
in
case
we
got
separated
he
gave
me
some
more
2c-b
and
a
capsule
of
mdma
i
took
the
2c-b
and
went
to
the
stream
nearby
to
relax
and
try
to
think
i
lay
on
the
ground
i
could
hear
frogs
croaking
but
they
sounded
like
machines
or
something
i
closed
my
eyes
and
focused
on
their
croaks
they
seemed
to
get
louder
until
it
was
unbearable
i
screamed
and
they
stopped
in
my
head
i
imagined
that
my
scream
had
ended
everything

i
wanted
to
see
what
i
had
done
as
it
was
so
quiet
i
could
not
even
hear
the
sound
of
the
music
only
my
heartbeat
instead
i
decided
i
would
re-create
the
world
in
my
mind
at
this
point
i
became
immersed
in
my
own
mind
i
was
creating
the
earth
like
a
god
it
was
swirling
masses
of
rocks
and
i
compacted
them
i
formed
mountains
i
flew
through
canyons
i
was
carving
with
my
mind

all
in
all
i
was
the
universe
i
was
god
i
was
the
gods
i
could
understand
everything
that
had
happened
everything
that
was
to
happen
and
why
i
knew
i
had
a
place
in
the
world
and
that
i
was
just
as
important
as
a
god
because
i
came
from
something
resembling
a
god

i
gripped
the
grass
around
me
tightly
and
ripped
up
handfuls
of
earth
the
ground
was
cold
and
damp
as
i
made
the
connection
to
what
i
had
done
the
frogs
croaking
became
clear
again
and
i
opened
my
eyes
the
first
signs
of
dawn
were
clearly
visible
as
orangey
pinky
glows
in
the
distance
i
washed
my
hands
in
the
stream
and
ventured
off
to
find
d
when
i
found
him
he
told
me
i
had
been
gone
for
about
3
hours
i
was
surprised
as
i
thought
i
had
been
gone
about
an
hour
tops
we
relaxed
at
the
tent
and
spoke
to
each
other
about
a
lot
of
shit


0530
we
decided
to
go
for
a
swim
and
clear
our
heads
i
took
the
other
mdma
cap
and
had
another
line
hoping
to
keep
up
a
happy
mindset
as
things
were
starting
to
turn
nasty
again
i
stepped
into
the
stream
and
my
feet
felt
like
they
had
been
dipped
in
liquid
nitrogen
the
sensation
persisted
as
i
went
in
deeper
i
washed
quickly
as
it
was
freezing
while
drying
myself
it
felt
like
the
towel
was
re-juvinating
me
while
i
rubbed
it
vigorously
over
my
body
i
felt
great
i
looked
at
d
and
we
plodded
off
again


0630
we
returned
to
the
tent
and
debated
trying
to
sleep
we
decided
it
would
be
impossible
we
decided
however
that
it
was
now
time
to
go
dance
but
not
before
some
k
i
had
a
small
bump
it
burned
a
little
it
was
beginning
to
take
effect
almost
instantly
as
it
felt
like
my
head
was
expanding
and
floating
at
the
same
time
i
lay
down
and
tried
to
forget
about
it
i
noticed
small
clouds
in
the
dawn
light
of
the
sky
they
comforted
me

there
were
disturbances
in
my
peripheral
vision
there
had
been
all
night
these
were
different
though

i
suddenly
felt
very
uncomfortable
and
my
head
started
to
\x93float
away
again
i
looked
down
at
my
shoes
and
they
seemed
like
i
was
looking
through
binoculars
backwards
i
immediately
jumped
up
wobbled
and
fell
over
again
i
was
kneeling
with
my
head
in
my
hands
i
could
feel
my
face
moving
further
away
from
my
head
i
couldnt
stop
it
i
was
trying
so
hard
to
keep
it
from
disappearing
i
imagined
myself
running
after
it
like
a
kid
chasing
a
helium
balloon
i
cried
out
for
d
he
came
up
and
pulled
me
to
my
feet
he
kept
saying
it
would
be
ok
i
believed
him

he
helped
me
walk
to
the
tent
i
lay
there
for
quite
some
time
playing
in
my
mind
i
eventually
felt
good
enough
to
stand
up
but
for
some
reason
wanted
more
k
i
had
another
2
bumps
and
collapsed
onto
the
bed
for
the
next
hour
i
was
obliterated
i
cant
even
begin
to
describe
the
things
that
went
on
in
my
head
the
tent
wasnt
real
i
wasnt
real
nothing
was
real
i
watched
the
universe
being
born
and
then
traveled
through
millions
of
years
of
the
universes
development
in
split
seconds
i
arrived
at
the
exact
point
i
was
at
and
jolted
upright
i
got
up
and
needed
to
go
outside

0900
i
went
to
dance
for
a
bit
and
found
d
sitting
playing
with
one
of
those
you
open
and
its
a
ball
of
interconnected
plastic
and
you
close
it
and
it
like
a
star
he
gave
it
to
me
and
i
danced
with
it
i
felt
so
good
and
could
feel
the
mdma
slightly
i
asked
d
for
more
as
i
was
enjoying
dancing
so
much
he
gave
me
what
was
my
last
2
capsules
i
gobbled
them
up
and
went
to
sit
down
as
i
felt
sick
they
hit
me
so
quickly
it
couldnt
have
been
more
than
10
minutes
i
jumped
and
danced
for
what
must
have
been
close
to
an
hour


1030
i
needed
to
eat
even
though
i
wasnt
hungry
but
i
felt
weak
i
opted
for
some
fruit
it
didnt
taste
of
much
but
i
could
feel
the
goodness
coursing
thru
my
veins
after
a
fair
amount
of
watermelon
and
some
mango
i
was
ready
to
vomit
so
i
walked
it
off
i
was
feeling
bouncy
and
lively
and
danced
for
a
short
while
until
my
stomach
started
to
cramp
i
needed
to
lie
down
i
went
to
the
first
soft
spot
i
had
found
the
previous
evening
and
lay
there
rubbing
my
stomach
it
felt
so
good
and
was
helping
a
lot
i
got
up
and
went
back
to
the
dance
floor
d
was
gone
i
went
to
the
tent
and
found
him
sorting
out
shrooms
to
go
sell
we
sold
shrooms
and
some
acid
for
a
while


1400

we
got
back
to
the
tent
after
walking
around
and
selling
the
drugs
we
decided
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
eat
some
shrooms
and
veg
out
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
we
both
ate
5
grams
each
and
lay
in
the
shade
waiting
for
them
to
take
effect
most
of
the
acid
was
still
going
but
everything
else
had
faded
the
mdma
was
still
giving
me
very
nice
euphoria

i
felt
the
familiar
leg
spasms
of
mushrooms
and
the
discomfort
in
my
stomach
my
vision
started
to
go
all
soft
and
hazy
i
realized
my
eyes
were
trying
to
close
so
i
closed
them
and
voyaged
into
my
mind
again
i
assumed
d
was
going
thru
the
same
thing
as
he
was
quiet
as
well
i
tried
to
delve
into
my
mind
and
as
i
traversed
the
corridors
of
my
mind
it
became
apparent
that
i
needed
to
change
i
was
a
disgusting
person
who
had
destroyed
my
life
with
drugs
i
argued
with
this
thought
and
figured
it
could
go
very
awry
at
this
point
i
opened
my
eyes
and
the
same
\x93evil
from
earlier
had
returned
i
was
freaking
out
i
looked
at
my
hands
and
didnt
believe
they
were
mine
i
looked
at
d
lying
next
to
me
he
looked
happy
with
a
smile
on
his
face
i
was
jealous
i
wanted
to
be
happy
i
got
up
and
went
into
the
tent
and
lay
down
again

everything
was
closing
in
on
me
i
could
hear
people
laughing
at
me
outside
the
world
was
mocking
me
i
closed
my
eyes
and
tried
to
break
through
this
funk
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
was
feeling
guilty
because
of
all
the
drugs
i
had
taken
and
promised
myself
never
to
do
it
again
i
couldnt
have
been
very
honest
with
myself
as
the
feelings
of
anger
and
guilt
grew
stronger
d
opened
the
tent
and
i
almost
fucking
died
of
fright
he
burst
out
laughing
and
eventually
so
did
i
i
asked
him
if
i
could
have
more
k
to
shift
the
focus
of
my
trip
he
obliged
with
2
small
bumps
i
did
one
the
same
feelings
as
before
persisted
but
they
were
looping
in
my
mind
i
could
look
at
them
from
another
perspective
i
snorted
the
other
bump
and
lay
down
again

this
time
my
mind
collapsed
in
on
itself
and
i
forget
the
details
but
i
remember
the
tent
vibrating
and
the
stretcher
that
i
was
lying
on
felt
like
pillows
stuffed
with
polystyrene
chunks
i
rolled
onto
the
floor
and
lay
on
my
stomach
my
stomach
started
growling
and
mumbling
i
tried
to
listen
to
what
it
was
saying
but
it
was
obviously
alien
i
even
tried
communication
but
failed
i
was
cramping
severely
and
in
a
wave
of
brilliance
decided
my
stomach
was
grumbling
but
then
it
spoke
almost
an
english
word
for
the
next
however
long
i
was
confused
angered
and
worried
about
my
stomach
i
think
i
may
have
fallen
asleep
because
when
i
opened
my
eyes
the
feeling
of
the
k
was
almost
gone
the
mushrooms
had
mellowed
out
and
d
was
nowhere
to
be
seen

1600
i
ate
some
more
food
and
prepared
myself
for
the
mescaline
and
impending
vomit
from
the
come-up
at
this
point
i
was
unsure
of
proceeding
with
this
ludicrous
weekend
d
convinced
me
that
we
had
gotten
this
close
to
infinity
that
we
had
to
go
on
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
talking
cod
shit
and
mellowing
out

1845
we
prepared
ourselves
mentally
for
the
mescaline
and
i
took
2
capsules
which
was
about
500mg
we
went
to
dance
while
we
waited
for
the
mescaline
i
know
it
takes
a
while
so
i
was
not
impatient
the
shrooms
were
still
going
slightly
and
my
visuals
were
pretty
and
soft
like
cotton
wool
spirals
we
danced
for
about
an
hour
but
my
legs
were
starting
to
feel
like
lead
so
i
sat
down
on
a
hay
bail

i
could
feel
the
mescaline
coming
on
slowly
and
felt
anxious
it
was
like
waves
of
warmth
moving
through
my
limbs
my
vision
was
getting
sharper
and
i
tried
to
focus
on
a
piece
of
hay
i
moved
it
around
and
it
left
long
lasting
trails
i
was
definitely
fucked
on
the
mescaline
as
i
became
aware
of
the
high
i
felt
sick
and
ran
off
to
a
tree
where
i
vomited
after
i
washed
my
face
i
surveyed
my
surroundings
i
was
feeling
really
happy
and
noticed
a
crowd
gathering
near
the
dance
floor
i
went
over
and
there
was
a
fire
dancer
show
starting
i
sat
in
awe
for
at
least
45
minutes
the
flames
seemed
like
molten
gold
and
amber
being
flung
around
and
controlled
by
some
magical
force

i
noticed
d
and
called
him
over
he
was
well
and
truly
high
he
was
also
amazed
at
the
flames
and
we
sat
talking
about
how
it
warmed
our
souls
to
see
something
like
that
i
asked
one
of
the
girls
with
the
fire
staff
if
i
could
have
a
go
she
obliged
i
focused
myself
and
tried
my
best
to
look
confident
i
managed
a
few
spins
before
dropping
it
i
returned
it
to
her
and
was
quite
impressed
d
was
laughing
as
he
reckons
i
made
the
dumbest
faces

we
both
walked
to
the
dance
floor
and
just
swayed
in
the
awesomeness
of
the
beats
i
had
to
go
stand
next
to
the
speaker
and
feel
the
power
of
the
bass
the
speaker
set-up
was
65k
turbo
sound
rig
and
was
fucking
loud
i
pressed
my
back
to
one
of
the
bass
bins
and
closed
my
eyes
what
came
next
was
truly
amazing
it
felt
like
i
was
floating
i
couldnt
feel
the
ground
at
all
i
had
to
open
my
eyes
to
make
sure
i
hadnt
floated
off
my
visuals
were
getting
more
intense
and
people
were
melting
and
moving
to
the
music
i
focused
on
one
girl
in
particular
who
was
dancing
like
she
was
loving
life
to
the
max
i
watched
her
for
ages
she
was
a
goddess
a
nymph
my
ultimate
desire

i
snapped
out
of
it
and
lost
site
of
her
i
had
to
find
her
i
plodded
off
and
eventually
was
lost
near
the
stream
i
have
no
idea
how
i
had
got
there
i
lay
down
as
i
felt
i
might
be
a
little
overwhelmed
i
faded
in
and
out
of
this
reality
and
into
the
next
orbs
of
\x93good
were
swirling
around
my
head
they
were
almost
humming
a
peaceful
tune
although
i
could
have
been
doing
this
i
was
in
touch
with
myself
my
inner
beauty
i
was
electric
and
amazing
i
felt
like
i
could
shoot
lightning
from
my
fingertips
i
got
up
and
had
to
find
d
to
see
if
he
was
feeling
amazing
as
well
he
was
at
the
tent

2300
we
had
been
chatting
for
ages
about
random
things
and
how
psychedelics
could
really
be
the
answer
to
a
lot
of
the
worlds
problems
if
anyone
had
ever
felt
like
we
did
they
would
never
want
to
harm
anyone
else
let
alone
destroy
whole
countries
i
had
another
bump
of
k
for
shits
and
giggles
it
didnt
do
much
apart
from
give
me
some
disturbing
cevs
of
flashing
lights
and
lightning

d
asked
if
i
wanted
to
hit
the
dmt
again
i
agreed
i
sat
on
the
stretcher
and
breathed
deeply
he
held
the
pipe
to
my
mouth
i
inhaled
held
it
and
breathed
out
i
could
feel
the
smoke
swirling
in
my
chest
and
throat
i
coughed
and
shattered
my
vision
i
focused
on
one
piece
at
it
fell
to
the
floor
it
was
getting
closer
and
i
was
almost
right
on
it
i
kept
falling
and
put
my
hand
out
to
stop
myself
but
was
stopped
by
something
i
saw
fractals
of
infinite
complexity
lines
so
thin
a
million
of
them
would
fit
into
a
single
strand
of
spider
web

i
heard
the
womans
voice
from
earlier
it
was
very
distant
this
time
i
turned
and
could
see
nothing
but
pulsating
glowing
colours
and
architectural
fractals
i
turned
once
more
and
there
she
was
a
woman
naked
and
dripping
water/mercury
she
was
pure
she
was
beautiful
i
reached
for
her
and
tried
to
grab
her
hand
it
was
impossible
to
she
moved
away
as
i
moved
towards
her
i
was
getting
frustrated
she
whispered
the
word
no
i
felt
happy
as
i
knew
now
that
she
was
unobtainable

slowly
the
tent
was
coming
back
and
i
could
hear
ringing
in
my
ears
i
woke
up
slumped
on
the
floor
d
was
laughing
and
said
i
was
doing
some
fucked
up
things
like
growling
and
shaking
i
lit
the
pipe
for
him
and
left
the
tent
so
he
could
enjoy
the
privacy
i
couldnt
believe
how
awesome
i
felt
my
soul
was
glowing
with
love
and
peace
it
came
of
waves
of
euphoria
that
can
only
described
as
god
touching
me
i
thought
back
to
the
feelings
i
had
on
the
mushrooms
and
could
understand
them
more
clearly
they
were
dirty
and
horrible
the
mescaline
\x93explained
that
i
was
not
entirely
ready
for
this
weekend
and
that
i
was
not
to
do
it
again
as
my
life
would
indeed
become
dirty
like
those
thoughts
it
continued
saying
that
i
was
experienced
enough
to
do
it
but
that
anything
in
excess
is
bad

i
felt
ashamed
and
the
presence
grew
stronger
i
could
feel
love
pain
anger
happiness
and
all
my
emotions
as
one
emotion
it
was
given
a
word
by
the
presence
but
i
have
forgotten
it
i
was
told
that
i
have
a
lot
to
give
to
this
world
and
should
not
let
the
pursuit
of
a
\x93high
stop
me
from
being
the
best
person
i
can
i
agreed
i
snapped
out
of
it
as
d
walked
up
behind
me
he
handed
me
another
2
capsules
of
mescaline
and
said
he
was
going
to
go
fuck
out
in
the
tent
i
took
them
and
decided
to
go
do
the
same

0500
i
awoke
out
of
a
haze
of
unconscious
consciousness
i
have
no
idea
how
long
i
lay
there
in
tent
for
i
cant
even
describe
the
things
i
had
done
in
my
mind
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
freaked
out
i
had
been
lying
there
for
the
whole
night
i
think
my
bodies
tiredness
was
too
much
to
handle
i
was
still
very
clearly
fucked
on
the
mescaline
and
went
to
watch
the
sunrise
i
yanked
d
out
of
his
sleeping
bag
and
we
went
up
to
the
rock
he
was
not
talkative
and
neither
was
i
but
we
seemed
to
communicate
without
words
we
sat
in
awe
of
the
sunrise
he
pulled
out
the
rest
of
the
k
and
i
refused
any
more
he
had
a
bump
and
we
both
just
sat
in
silence
for
what
seemed
like
ages
i
could
see
ants
working
bugs
doing
there
thing
and
suddenly
felt
guilty
about
work

which
was
the
next
day
i
put
it
out
my
mind
and
continued
to
watch
things
going
about
their
comical
business


for
the
rest
of
the
morning
we
didnt
do
much
apart
from
smoke
a
few
joints
and
eat
some
food
d
was
convinced
some
of
his
soul
had
been
stolen
i
on
the
other
hand
felt
like
my
soul
had
been
given
a
second
chance
another
chance
to
be
great
i
told
him
he
was
being
silly
and
that
it
was
probably
the
k
he
agreed
and
started
laughing
i
said
we
should
do
it
again
next
week
jokingly
i
think
he
almost
fell
off
his
chair
until
i
said
it
was
a
joke
he
seemed
very
serious
and
i
was
starting
to
feel
uncomfortable
i
said
i
was
going
to
bathe
in
the
stream


when
i
returned
everyone
was
packing
up
i
helped
and
we
left
shortly
afterwards
i
was
still
very
high
in
the
car
on
the
way
home
and
watched
as
the
scenery
flitted
by
i
was
relieved
to
get
home
and
have
a
shower
i
felt
like
the
shower
cleansed
me
inside
i
thought
back
to
what
the
mescaline
had
told
me
and
smiled
i
knew
i
would
be
ok
i
watched
tv
for
the
rest
of
the
day
until
i
fell
fast
asleep

conclusion
i
feel
i
seriously
over
did
it
but
things
like
this
dont
happen
very
often
i
will
be
taking
a
years
break
from
psychedelics
and
hope
to
only
do
mescaline
and
lsd
when
i
start
again
i
came
to
the
realization
that
although
psychedelics
can
reveal
truths
about
myself
and
the
world
it
is
still
a
drug
and
will
be
used
in
the
pursuit
of
a
high
i
vow
never
to
look
at
psychedelics
in
this
way
again
and
treat
them
with
the
respect
they
deserve




i
am
a
23
year
old
male
weighing
120
pounds
with
an
extensive
background
using
a
variety
of
psychedelics
i
have
combined
mdma
with
trichocereus
peruvianus
twice
in
the
past
with
extremely
positive
effects
this
was
my
first
time
attempting
the
combination
of
mdma
and
trichocereus
bridgesii
i
like
the
bridgesii
cactus
because
it
is
more
potent
than
the
peruvian
torch
ten
grams
of
bridgesii
on
its
own
is
for
me
a
good
strong
dose
equivalent
in
effects
to
about
twenty
grams
of
peruvianus
i
am
slightly
insensitive
to
the
effects
of
mdma
preferring
doses
over
150
milligrams
i
have
one
prior
experience
smoking
dmt

substances
dosages
and
timing

t
+
000
pure
mdma
300
milligrams
t

6-8

2

inhalations
pure
dmt
cannabis
smoked
throughout
and
the
odd
bit
of
blue
lotus
nymphaea
caerulea
as
well

set
setting
and
intent

a
good
friend
arranged
a
halloween
psychonauting
party
costumes
mandatory
i
went
as
the
village
shaman
about
sixty
people
in
attendance
most
of
them
on
300
milligrams
of
mdma
most
attendees
are
highly
experienced
with
psychedelics
but
we
had
a
few
first
timers
too
so
we
took
care
to
make
sure
they
were
having
a
good
experience
and
staying
hydrated
several
people
there
were
djs
and
there
was
a
2000
watt
stereo
system
set
up
so
the
music
all
night
was
fantastic
starting
out
with
mellow
electronica
fading
into
some
nice
psytrance
while
the
mdma
is
peaking
and
mellowing
back
out
later
in
the
evening
well
morning
technically
even
heard
a
little
enya
thrown
on
the
tables
at
around
5
am

i
had
a
bag
of
50
grams
of
trichocereus
bridgesii
that
i
was
intending
on
sharing
with
several
psychonauting
companions
as
a
complement
to
the
mdma
we
were
dosing
in
my
experience
combining
cactus
with
mdma
makes
me
feel
like
i
am
rolling
along
nicely
for
twelve
hours
just
as
the
mdma
starts
to
ease
off
the
cactus
will
pick
up
keeping
me
at
this
beautiful
empathic
plateau
for
hours
and
hours
i
handed
out
handfuls
of
cactus
ranging
from
about
5
grams
to
up
to
10
grams
to
half
a
dozen
people
ate
a
good
handful
of
cactus
myself
and
used
the
remaining
bits
of
flesh
in
the
bottom
of
the
bag
to
give
several
more
people
\x93just
a
taste
not
enough
to
effect
them
judging
by
the
alkaloid
content
but
the
spirit
of
this
plant
is
very
powerful
and
it
was
more
to
connect
us
all
on
a
group
level
share
a
group
tripping
experience
you
dont
need
a
psychoactive
dose
to
connect
with
the
cactus
especially
around
other
people
especially
if
all
those
other
people
are
on
mdma
the
potential
for
contact
highs
and
shared
vibrations
is
enormous

my
intention
for
this
trip
was
two
fold
to
connect
with
others
deeply
through
an
empathogenic
experience
and
to
work
on
opening
my
heart
chakra
sharing
loving
energy
with
those
around
me
and
remembering
also
to
love
myself
as
always
i
found
the
line
between
\x93recreational
and
\x93spiritual
use
to
be
blurred
in
a
situation
like
this
the
kind
of
recreation
i
had
in
mind
is
a
spiritual
journey
in
and
of
itself

the
experience

it
took
perhaps
45
minutes
before
i
could
feel
the
mdma
coming
on
a
nice
smooth
entry
despite
the
high
dose
because
id
been
eating
cactus
too
i
just
sat
and
rested
a
little
bit
to
let
the
slight
stomach
discomfort
and
nervous
energy
dissipate
to
eat
the
cactus
we
were
just
chewing
up
pieces
of
the
dry
flesh
and
swallowing
them
with
water
the
more
you
chew
it
the
faster
it
kicks
in
if
you
can
handle
the
terrible
bitter
taste
while
doing
so

when
the
mdma
hit
everything
was
definitely
ecstatic
myriad
who
has
never
done
drugs
before
and
is
having
her
first
experience
on
300
milligrams
of
mdma
and
a
few
tokes
of
pot
is
blowing
up
hard
as
am
i
we
hug
each
other
very
tightly
and
then
kiss
\x93im
a
lesbian
she
then
says
to
which
i
reply
\x93thats
alright
youre
a
beautiful
lesbian
youre
going
to
have
girls
all
over
you

\x93ive
never
had
a
girlfriend
she
says
and
i
tell
her
im
sure
that
will
change
in
the
future
she
really
is
stunningly
beautiful
\x93omg
she
saws
with
a
tinge
of
awe
and
amazement
in
her
voice
\x93wed
never
be
doing
this
if
we
werent
on
drugs

i
spent
a
long
time
chilling
with
my
friends
cala
and
tom
in
their
room
as
we
were
feeling
a
bit
overwhelmed
in
the
main
area
of
the
party
all
of
us
were
peaking
on
the
mdma
and
the
cactus
was
starting
to
affect
us
a
bit
as
well
we
had
some
great
conversations
these
are
people
ive
hung
out
with
a
fair
bit
but
wed
never
sat
down
and
had
a
good
chat
like
this
before
it
turns
out
we
have
all
sorts
of
things
in
common
the
love
of
plants
especially
trees
and
of
course
also
the
love
of
funky
psychedelic
ethnobotanicals


i
recall
at
one
point
being
handed
a
log
of
poplar
wood
that
cala
and
tom
had
picked
up
somewhere
and
spent
some
time
infusing
with
loving
energy
i
couldnt
help
myself
i
had
to
cradle
the
log
like
you
would
a
cute
little
puppy
dog
because
the
feeling
of
loving
vibration
coming
from
the
wood
was
so
comforting
cala
gave
us
both
back
massages
which
felt
amazing
at
some
point
our
other
friend
kali
joined
us
in
the
room
and
we
ended
up
in
a
four-way
reciprocal
foot
massaging
cuddle
puddle


after
awhile
i
began
to
notice
the
pattern
of
blue
flowers
on
the
blanket
taking
on
a
life
of
its
own
waving
gently
as
if
blown
by
the
breeze
coming
in
the
open
window
during
this
time
we
smoked
a
couple
of
joints
of
very
potent
weed
with
some
blue
lotus
mixed
into
one
of
them
the
blue
lotus
adds
a
nice
relaxing
mellow
vibe
taking
away
some
of
the
stimulant
edge

sometime
later
i
went
back
out
into
the
party
to
chat
with
others
and
smoke
some
bowls
of
pot
the
mdma
was
wearing
down
a
bit
the
peak
definitely
gone
and
i
felt
a
bit
worn
out
but
the
cactus
wasnt
going
to
let
go
anytime
soon
the
combined
effect
was
like
i
was
still
rolling
at
a
good
strong
mdma
plateau
except
i
was
a
little
more
tired
and
there
were
definate
visual
effects
going
on
lights
and
colours
were
heightened
as
if
the
whole
world
had
been
rendered
by
renoir
or
some
other
impressionist
painter
it
felt
nice
to
just
sit
in
a
comfy
chair
breathing
in
the
serene
calmness
i
was
totally
mellowed
out
but
at
the
same
time
wide
awake
no
hope
of
sleep
and
still
incredibly
empathic
towards
everyone

back
in
cala
and
toms
room
we
smoked
a
nice
joint
the
three
of
us
and
this
other
girl
curled
up
together
on
the
bed
under
the
blankets
none
of
us
were
sleeping
but
we
all
just
lay
mostly
in
silence
tripping
out
on
the
patterns
on
the
walls
there
was
a
rainbow
lightbulb
screwed
into
the
socket
which
cast
gentle
patterns
of
colour
on
the
ceiling
and
walls
like
stained
glass
would
as
i
stared
at
the
colours
i
would
see
them
shrink
and
grow
and
the
shade
would
fluctuate
purple
to
red
red
to
orange
then
back
towards
purple
again
bunches
of
dried
herbs
and
some
sticks
and
such
attached
to
the
walls
cast
strange
shadows
which
shifted
slowly
in
a
liquid
fashion

the
dmt
nightcap

most
people
were
either
passed
out
mellowed
out
or
gone
home
but
for
some
of
us
the
cactus
was
still
running
strong
it
had
been
about
ten
hours
since
dosing
star
comes
up
and
softly
whispers
to
me
\x93do
you
want
to
do
some
dmt

\x93definitely
i
reply

\x93okay
follow
me
to
the
little
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
andreas
and
condor
come
with
us
and
we
discretely
depart
the
room
as
andreas
only
has
a
few
doses
left
the
material
is
a
clean
white
crystalline
powder
extracted
from
mimosa
hostilis
root
bark

out
comes
the
little
freebase
pipe
dedicated
solely
to
dmt
and
already
encrusted
with
much
residue
from
the
last
time
these
people
went
crazy
on
dmt
sitting
comfortably
against
the
wall
with
a
pillow
at
my
back
star
started
melting
down
the
dmt
onto
the
walls
of
the
freebase
pipe
it
was
only
my
second
time
doing
dmt
but
i
was
confident
it
would
go
smoothly
and
that
i
would
be
able
to
let
go
easily
as
i
had
the
first
time


as
star
held
the
pipe
and
heated
it
from
the
bottom
with
a
lighter
a
ball
of
billowing
white
smoke
formed
in
the
chamber
i
drew
in
my
breath
long
slow
and
deep
held
for
a
few
seconds
exhaled
and
immediately
began
another
long
slow
inhalation
this
time
when
finished
i
held
the
toke
in
and
settle
back
as
the
initial
comeup
is
already
setting
in

i
hear
the
dmt
carrier
wave
a
sharp
clear
and
pure
note
of
sound
like
a
turning
fork
rung
inside
my
head
which
grows
in
intensity
and
rises
in
pitch
as
i
begin
to
fall
into
the
trance
state
my
thoughts
are
surprisingly
completely
clear
and
lucid
through
this
\x93follow
the
carrier
wave
i
tell
myself
slumping
forward
slightly
with
eyes
closed

the
dmt
rushes
over
me
in
waves
the
first
wave
makes
me
catch
my
throat
a
bit
an
odd
constricting
and
mildly
threatening
sensation
i
concentrate
on
relaxing
and
just
breathing
my
breathing
pattern
falls
naturally
into
a
meditative
pattern
deep
inhalations
pulling
as
much
energy
in
as
possible
and
then
deep
exhalations
letting
go
of
all
the
tension

i
feel
i
am
inside
a
living
crystal
which
pulses
and
resonates
with
glowing
energy
its
not
a
\x93visionary
experience
no
elves
no
landscapes
no
parables
rather
just
intense
sensations
of
colour
and
light
vibrating
and
fading
brighter
softer
brighter
and
softer
again
several
progressive
waves
come
over
me
putting
me
in
a
deeper
and
deeper
trance
state
i
hear
one
of
my
guiding
friends
ask
another
a
question
in
a
quiet
and
gentle
voice
trying
not
to
disturb
my
journey
it
doesnt
disturb
me
at
all
but
i
smile
inwardly
as
complex
moving
patterns
of
colour
are
manifested
by
the
sound
of
their
voices
i
am
seeing
what
they
are
speaking
as
shifting
and
twisting
colours

there
came
a
point
where
i
knew
the
dmt
had
peaked
the
waves
started
to
become
less
intense
less
involving
just
starting
to
come
out
of
the
dmt
trance
i
felt
exactly
the
way
i
feel
on
a
good
dose
of
ayahuasca

there
was
an
emotional
overtone
a
feeling
of
subtle
energies
within
me
moving
around
i
felt
compelled
to
open
my
eyes
now
and
when
i
do
i
simply
stare
in
amazement
at
a
little
patch
of
carpet
with
some
scattered
bits
of
paper
and
garbage
the
plain
grey
carpet
is
covered
in
beautiful
patterns
fractal
mandalas
star
flakes
in
gentle
reds
and
blues
and
greens
which
shift
and
change
as
i
look
at
them
creeping
and
growing
expanding
shrinking
its
like
a
skin
that
rests
right
beneath
the
surface
of
all
reality
these
beautiful
textured
living
patterns
of
life
that
dmt
has
opened
my
eyes
to


dmt
is
the
most
profoundly
visual
substance
ive
ever
had
the
opportunity
to
experience
the
strange
part
of
the
experience
is
that
my
mind
stays
so
lucid
so
clear
just
like
a
deep
state
of
meditation
theres
no
interfering
sensation
of
being
\x93high
so
all
i
can
do
is
marvel
at
the
light
show
and
feeling
of
absolute
energy
how
can
this
substance
be
so
visual
and
yet
leave
me
feeling
like
i
am
standing
right
there
inside
the
patterns
a
sober
observer
to
the
swirling
energies
on
all
sides

the
last
waves
of
dmt
are
washing
over
me
now
in
between
i
feel
almost
out
of
the
trip
and
have
a
strong
desire
to
communicate
what
i
had
just
experienced
i
am
awed
at
the
power
of
this
substance
and
yet
also
at
the
very
natural
feel
to
it
dmt
seems
to
swim
through
the
brain
like
a
fish
in
water
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
drug
just
intense
life
energy
radiating
pulsing
shifting
and
reforming
everywhere
theres
a
great
feeling
of
wellbeing
during
the
afterglow
too
i
feel
totally
revitalized
and
like
my
brain
has
been
\x93reset
and
is
running
more
smoothly
as
a
result
thoughts
are
crisp
and
clear
and
the
ability
to
fall
into
a
mild
trance
state
using
meditative
breathing
lingers
after
the
initial
dmt
flash

nearly
back
to
reality
i
chat
a
few
moments
about
what
id
been
feeling
and
seeing
and
then
make
my
exit
from
the
room
before
the
next
space
monkey
makes
his
entrance
to
the
dmt
world
the
first
words
out
of
my
mouth
after
smoking
the
dmt
are
a
heartfelt
\x93thank
you
i
head
upstairs
and
hang
out
feeling
chatty
and
social
and
enjoying
the
afterglow

this
dmt
experience
had
a
very
different
feel
to
the
last
time
i
did
it
i
would
attribute
this
mainly
to
set
and
setting
the
first
time
i
did
dmt
i
was
in
a
natural
forest
environment
with
pleasant
afternoon
sunshine
and
i
took
a
little
more
time
to
calm
and
prepare
myself
before
smoking
the
dmt
the
resulting
trip
was
one
of
deep
connection
to
the
earth
the
second
time
was
in
a
small
dimly
lit
room
and
i
definitely
got
a
stronger
dose
on
this
second
trip
too
the
effects
lasted
longer
and
there
were
more
waves
than
the
first
time
i
had
smoked
dmt
what
was
the
same
both
times
was
seeing
these
amazing
energy
patterns
underlying
everything
the
constantly
shifting
fractal
patterns
of
life
also
both
times
i
felt
remarkably
lucid
and
aware
enough
to
remember
everything
that
happened
even
at
the
peak
of
the
trip

this
combination
seems
pretty
innocuous
physically
sensitive
individuals
experienced
some
nausea
but
no
one
vomited
or
had
signs
of
hypertension
serotonin
syndrome
or
anything
like
that
it
did
take
two
whole
days
to
return
fully
to
baseline
after
this
experience
mind
you
this
was
unexpected
as
trichocereus
bridgesii
on
its
own
seems
to
last
12-16
hours
and
ive
never
felt
an
mdma
afterglow
for
that
long
everyone
who
had
eaten
both
the
cactus
and
the
mdma
reported
this
lingering
effect
even
those
who
had
eaten
only
small
amounts
of
cactus
some
kind
of
interesting
synergy
appears
to
go
on
between
these
substances
the
two
days
after
the
trip
were
very
enjoyable
as
everytime
i
sparked
up
a
joint
this
wave
of
love
and
empathy
would
wash
back
over
me
i
also
found
i
was
very
sensitive
to
the
food
i
was
eating
meat
and
dairy
products
and
any
heavy
food
i
found
very
unappealing
i
ate
a
lot
of
fruit
and
grains
as
this
seemed
the
easiest
to
digest
on
the
third
day
i
experienced
an
emotional
crash
not
unexpected
with
such
a
large
dose
of
mdma
by
the
fourth
day
several
subjects
including
myself
had
developed
a
head
cold
i
think
this
combination
might
run
down
the
immune
system
somewhat
stay
safe
and
happy
tripping




i
recently
wrote
an
experience
report
entitled
entirely
immersive
report
id57936
whereby
i
smoked
dmt
for
the
first
time
the
following
experience
is
related
to
an
oral
dose
of
dmt
taken
a
few
weeks
later
with
the
hopes
of
eliciting
a
more
cerebral
trip
and
that
it
did


i
am
referencing
my
last
report
for
those
who
might
wish
to
compare
the
two

i
decided
on
a
50
mg
dose
of
dmt
rendered
orally
active
with
a
3
g
dose
of
ground
syrian
rue

the
setting
was
as
near
to
perfect
as
i
could
dream
up
a
small
cedar
lined
yurt
with
a
gas
stove
fireplace
nestled
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
on
a
crystalline
lake

the
morning
sky
was
dark
with
snow
and
a
powerful
wind
was
blowing
down
from
the
mountainside
past
our
yurt
leaning
heavily
on
the
giant
firs
and
spruce
surrounding
us
my
girlfriend
and
i
lay
nestled
by
the
fire
in
our
cozy
little
cabin
with
candles
set
about
the
room


my
girlfriend
was
going
to
sit
for
me
and
had
set
aside
her
day
to
do
so
she
understands
me
well
and
is
a
talented
sitter
so
along
with
a
perfect
setting
i
was
feeling
confident
going
into
the
experience
knowing
that
my
needs
would
be
met
no
matter
where
the
journey
took
me
we
began
the
experiment
at
1130
am
a
couple
hours
following
a
light
breakfast

0000

i
formed
the
powdered
rue
into
pellets
by
blending
it
with
a
very
small
amount
of
melted
butter
and
swallowed
them
with
water

i
didnt
taste
a
thing

a
subtle
light
headedness
began
to
come
on
after
about
a
half
hour
and
i
was
surprised
there
was
no
nausea

0045

i
ate
the
yellowish
dmt
crystals
in
a
gelcap
and
then
sat
scrawling
notes
in
my
dream
journal
waiting
for
effects
to
come
on
changes
were
noticed
after
only
about
15
minutes
and
at
30
minutes
were
more
clearly
pronounced
it
felt
like
a
slight
drunkenness
being
mostly
physical
marked
by
a
lack
of
balance
and
coordination
this
may
have
been
primarily
the
maoi

my
girlfriend
suddenly
and
unfortunately
realized
she
forgot
to
arrange
her
absence
from
work
so
we
reluctantly
headed
into
the
village
with
me
in
the
passenger
seat
and
her
sober
so
we
could
pick
up
a
cell
signal

as
we
made
the
14
mile
journey
the
trip
began
to
come
on
and
it
felt
surprisingly
like
mushrooms

an
oceanic
feeling
swept
over
me
and
the
mountainsides
began
to
take
on
a
crisp
colourful
appearance
the
subtle
hues
of
nature
were
blooming
forth
in
palettes
of
pink
and
yellow
and
green

i
noticed
it
getting
harder
to
hold
conversation
there
was
a
bit
of
nausea
but
overall
i
felt
quite
serene

little
did
i
know
how
this
would
all
change

0145

returning
to
the
yurt
i
find
it
is
no
longer
easy
to
write
my
notes
although
the
trip
is
still
quite
mild
we
sit
and
talk
for
a
while
and
i
notice
strong
therapeutic
psychological
effects
coming
on
i
muse
to
my
girlfriend
that
i
have
to
prevent
my
ego
from
squashing
my
creativity
and
that
i
recognize
i
am
more
insecure
with
myself
than
i
would
like
to
be

these
ideas
persist
and
within
another
half
hour
i
am
remarking
on
how
pushy
this
substance
is
i
dont
feel
like
im
in
control
and
feel
the
power
of
the
substance
taking
hold

0200

false
comedown

the
effects
begin
to
subside
and
i
suggest
to
my
girlfriend
that
i
am
probably
beyond
the
peak
of
the
trip
and
i
might
be
on
the
downswing

i
pull
her
in
for
a
big
hug
and
as
i
hold
her
i
notice
a
beautiful
shimmer
in
the
wood
grain
of
the
wall

apparently
im
not
over
the
peak
yet

as
it
turns
out

the

things
begin
to
look
digitized

liquid
and
remind
me
of
my
smoked

experience
only
milder
my
girlfriend
looks
astonishingly
beautiful
to
me
not
that
she
isnt
always
but
now

even
more
so

i
feel
the
trip
rushing
forwards
as
if
im
on
an
accelerating

i
have

\x93damn

i

my

repeatedly

my

through

emotional
vortex
at
1000
miles

my
teeth
are
chattering
and
i
am
releasing
a
long
nonsensical
utterance
which
amounted
to
nothing
less
than
internal
energy
trying
to
escape

i

i

i

the

my

atmospheric
re-entry

although
i
am
enjoying
this
in
some
perverse
sense
of
the
word
i
begin
to
want
it
to
stop
it
is
just
too
much
to
bear

as
anxiety
and
exhaustion
set
in
i
ask
for
xanax
but
my
sensible
sitter
asks
me
to
hold
off
if
i
can
because
we
dont
know
the
effects
of
xanax
with
an
maoi



like
a
spaceship
re-entering
the
atmosphere
the
final
minutes
of
the
trip
were
like
burning
through
a
wall
of
sheer
terror
it
was
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
trip
the
most
exhausting
but
very
abruptly
it
began
to
tail
off
and
within
another
15
minutes
or
so
i
could
see
the
light
of
consensus
reality
once
again
as
if
dropping
by
parachute
under
a
clearing
sky

i
was
relieved
indeed

in
no
uncertain
terms
this
trip
blew
me
away

it
is
the
single
most
intense
experience
ive
had
and
ive
had
quite
a
few
it
was
unforgiving
ruthless
and
downright
ferocious
yet
uncomprehendingly
beautiful

i
am
damn
glad
i
had
a
lot
of
psychedelic
experience
under
my
belt
before
going
through
it
i
also
have
my
faithful
girlfriend
to
thank
as
she
was
integral
to
the
control
of
this
situation

it
was
a
beautiful
life
changing
experience
for
me
it
left
me
feeling
profoundly
thankful
for
my
life
my
friends
and
family
i
was
given
clear
visions
with
respect
to
my
life
where
it
is
headed
and
what
i
should
and
should
not
be
doing
with
it

i
have
been
humbled
i
will
do
it
again
for
sure
i
just
dont
know
when




recently
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
a
small
amount
of
dmt
which
happened
to
be
enough
for
9
experiments
the
first
was
a
small
dose
probably
less
than
10mg
smoked
with
poor
technique
on
some
foil
the
second
was
an
85mg
oral
trip
taken
with
moclobemide
which
resulted
in
an
overall
++
experience
with
several
breif
periods
when
i
would
get
sucked
into
a
very
intense
strong
+++
trip
i
also
experienced
limited
weak
entity
contact
during
that
experience
i
wrote
trip
reports
for
both
of
those
experiences

my
2nd
3rd
4th
and
5th
experiences
all
occured
within
a
two
hour
time
period
each
time
with
between
5mg
and
7mg
smoked
on
a
small
amount
of
cannabis
i
found
that
experience
or
series
of
experiences
if
you
dont
think
im
cheating
by
counting
them
as
seperate
to
be
highly
enjoyable

so
a
few
nights
later
i
decided
to
get
a
bit
deeper
into
dmt
space
but
i
only
had
a
small
amount
of
dmt
left
24mg
to
be
precise
this
may
sound
like
a
small
amount
of
dmt
to
you
-
and
it
certainly
is
but
if
there
was
one
thing
i
learned
a
few
nights
earlier
it
was
that
a
little
bit
of
dmt
goes
a
long
way
one
thing
to
consider
is
my
technique
smoking
the
dmt
on
top
of
cannabis
i
am
positive
that
this
potentiates
the
dmt
experience
by
an
unquantifiable
degree
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
flavors
the
experience
and
im
not
sure
if
this
is
for
the
better
or
not
i
would
probably
not
smoke
a
much
larger
dose
of
dmt
combined
with
cannabis
for
fear
of
too
much
anxiety
and
confusion
during
the
trip
regardless
i
had
a
truly
amazing
experience
the
way
i
did
it

this
evening
i
also
planned
to
leave
less
time
between
smoking
dmt
if
i
remember
correctly
i
smoked
my
24mg
of
dmt
in
two
parts
each
approximately
half
of
the
material
sprinkled
on
a
small
bowlpack
of
moderately
potent
cannabis
but
i
was
quite
stoned
before
i
even
started
smoking
the
dmt
so
i
was
certainly
fully
affected
by
cannabis
during
the
dmt
experience
i
should
probably
also
mention
i
took
an
unweighed
dose
of
piracetam
for
the
first
time
in
several
weeks
about
10
hours
earlier
probably
around
15
grams

i
took
my
first
hit
holding
the
flame
above
the
dmt
as
i
drew
to
burn
it
as
slowly
as
possible
and
melting
it
rather
than
setting
it
on
fire
right
away
hold
it
in
for
15
or
20
seconds
and
blow
it
out
slowly
savoring
the
oddly
delicious
flavor
of
the
dmt/cannabis
vapors
i
repeat
this
time
starting
to
burn
the
material
and
drawing
a
bigger
lungful
of
smoke
i
discovered
a
few
nights
earlier
that
this
method
works
just
fine
and
in
fact
seems
almost
nescessary
to
get
all
of
the
dmt
out
of
the
half-burnt
weed
as
i
hold
the
smoke
in
i
can
feel
my
mind
start
to
expand
beyond
the
boundaries
of
my
skull
by
the
time
i
blew
it
out
i
was
surrounded
by
movement
and
bright
colors

objects
on
my
desk
were
squirming
around
as
if
i
were
peaking
on
a
couple
grams
of
really
good
shrooms
except
they
were
a
bit
livelier
brighter
and
happier
on
dmt
transparent
neon
colors
especially
blue
and
yellow
forming
vague
and
blurry
geometric
patterns
were
suspended
in
the
air
before
my
eyes
every
so
often
i
would
see
a
small
glowing
ball
of
light
dash
across
my
field
of
vision
or
a
pair
of
weird
eyeballs
pop
in
and
out
of
existence
in
some
random
location
i
perceived
these
as
entities
but
that
i
had
not
smoked
enough
to
really
get
a
better
look
at
these
things

it
was
also
difficult
not
to
notice
the
fact
that
i
was
extremely
high
dmt
feels
similar
to
lsd
in
the
sense
that
the
high
is
very
much
concentrated
in
your
head
however
there
is
no
body
load
to
speak
of
dmt
feels
so
natural
on
the
body
there
was
definitely
a
buzzing
sensation
a
floaty
fluid
feeling
and
a
sensation
that
my
consciousness
was
extended
across
a
larger
space
it
feels
good
but
i
do
not
find
there
is
a
huge
euphoric
push
or
forced
mood
lift
most
positive
feelings
are
a
result
of
the
experience
itself
not
a
nescessary
part
of
the
drugs
effects

so
i
put
on
some
music
i
listened
to
grateful
dead
some
phish
and
other
mostly-live
hippie
music
over
the
course
of
the
next
hour
or
so
i
found
that
the
dmt
no
doubt
enhanced
by
the
cannabis
made
my
music
sound
absolutely
amazing
and
made
me
feel
like
i
was
in
the
crowd
sitting
outside
on
the
grass
on
a
sunny
summer
day
experiencing
a
concert
live
among
a
crowd
of
groovy
people

i
dont
know
why
i
decided
to
mess
around
in
photoshop
at
this
time
but
it
was
fun
and
i
enjoyed
the
visuals
looking
at
the
computer
screen
i
realized
how
strange
and
kind
of
lame
it
was
to
be
on
my
computer
during
a
dmt
trip
and
also
realized
i
am
pretty
much
tied
to
my
computer
for
a
lot
of
the
time
when
i
dont
have
anything
else
to
do
but
i
continued
to
use
the
computer
anyway

the
effects
of
the
dmt
were
still
going
strong
and
i
thought
i
better
smoke
it
soon
if
i
want
to
get
any
higher
on
this
stuff
before
i
run
out
dmt
seemed
to
erase
my
concept
of
time
it
seemed
like
i
had
done
too
much
stuff
after
smoking
the
first
bowl
of
dmt
to
still
be
feeling
it
this
strong
i
found
looking
at
the
clock
that
my
estimates
of
elapsed
time
were
always
much
longer
than
reality
also
i
believe
the
cannabis
extends
the
length
of
dmts
action
i
ate
3mg
of
melatonin
hoping
it
would
kick
in
after
the
dmt
had
worn
off
to
help
me
sleep
then
i
went
to
pack
some
fresh
greens
in
my
bowl
with
the
second
half
of
my
dmt

oops
id
forgotten
i
still
hadnt
finished
the
first
bowl
i
finished
off
the
cannabis
in
a
couple
more
hits
along
with
a
very
noticeable
amount
of
dmt
which
raised
me
right
back
to
the
intensity
of
my
first
peak
which
had
died
down
a
bit
in
the
time
it
took
me
to
arrive
at
this
point
i
chilled
out
for
a
couple
minutes
noticing
increased
entity
activity
in
the
air
around
me
this
was
actually
very
distracting
because
it
seemed
like
they
were
fond
of
sneaking
up
on
me

but
i
didnt
wait
long
to
pack
those
fresh
greens
and
put
the
remaining
12mg
of
dmt
on
top
of
it
i
took
it
all
down
in
three
or
four
big
hits

by
the
time
id
blown
out
the
second
to
last
hit
i
noticed
my
bed
was
levitating
by
the
time
id
blown
out
my
last
hit
there
was
a
river
formed
of
psychedelic
patterns
flowing
through
my
floor
the
high
was
getting
too
intense
for
me
to
sit
at
my
desk
any
longer
so
i
quickly
made
a
playlist
on
my
computer
that
would
last
about
30
minutes
and
then
i
made
my
way
over
to
my
bed
to
lie
down

i
experienced
a
sensation
like
my
body
was
being
gently
yet
persistantly
pulled
up
into
space
i
would
have
loved
to
have
enjoyed
this
sensation
and
meditated
in
this
state
of
being
but
there
were
far
too
many
distractions
the
amount
of
activity
in
the
air
consisting
of
flying
glowing
energy
balls
fluid
transparent
amorphous
shapes
-
one
of
which
remained
just
over
my
right
shoulder
and
followed
me
into
the
bathroom
as
i
stood
above
the
toilet
and
did
my
business
-
lets
see
what
else
oh
yes
plenty
of
pairs
of
glowing
eyes
popping
in
and
out
of
existence
in
random
places
i
wouldnt
ever
take
dmt
without
expecting
to
see
those
well
in
general
there
was
just
a
whole
lot
of
things
flying
through
the
air
usually
at
such
a
quick
speed
that
i
couldnt
help
but
divert
my
attention
towards
it
that
meant
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
lying
in
my
bed
with
my
eyes
fully
open
darting
around
in
partial
amazement
partial
intimidation
at
all
these
phenomena

my
intimidation
simply
came
from
the
fact
that
they
always
snuck
up
on
me
honestly
seeing
a
pair
of
glowing
cat-like
eyeballs
pop
out
of
something
is
more
creepy
than
cool
for
me
the
zooming
energy
balls
were
allright
except
that
every
once
in
a
while
one
of
them
would
flash
very
brightly
and
a
couple
of
times
that
startled
me
the
fluid
amorphous
blobs
were
probably
my
favorite
although
i
didnt
like
how
they
or
maybe
it
was
just
one
i
never
saw
more
than
one
of
these
at
once
liked
to
linger
over
my
shoulder
also
i
asked
it
not
to
follow
me
when
i
took
a
piss
but
it
did
anyway

so
i
spent
what
felt
like
a
really
long
time
lying
in
bed
watching
these
entities
i
couldnt
really
get
much
deep
thinking
done
although
i
did
have
plenty
of
trippy
streams
of
thought
that
i
cant
remember
now
my
tapestries
were
in
a
state
of
constant
reconfiguration
and
movement
at
one
point
my
tapestry
turned
into
the
grateful
dead
dancing
bears
except
not
exactly
the
same
anyway
they
were
a
weirder
version
of
the
dancing
bears
but
they
were
definitely
dancing

after
a
while
i
noticed
that
the
neon
color
patterns
before
my
eyes
had
reappeared
and
come
back
much
more
clearly
defined
this
time
the
pattern
was
unmistakeable
it
was
the
chrysanthemum
that
ive
read
about
many
times
in
other
dmt
reports

i
perceived
this
chrysanthemum
as
a
dome
made
of
interlocking
almost-triangles
which
seemed
to
be
suspended
five
to
ten
feet
above
and
to
the
front
of
my
head
i
realized
that
this
was
only
a
cross-section
of
a
tunnel-of-sorts
with
one
end
coming
out
of
my
forehead
and
the
other
end
extending
deep
into
space
i
couldnt
tell
if
it
was
a
one-way
or
two-way
connection
it
seemed
like
my
soul
was
a
projection
of
my
actual
existence
which
was
deep
in
space
so
that
i
could
make
use
of
my
human
body
for
whatever
reason

during
this
time
i
was
experiencing
auditory
hallucinations
in
the
form
of
beeps
whirring
sounds
made
by
the
glowing
balls
of
energy
and
strange
muffled
spoken
language
i
thought
this
was
fascinating
but
it
also
made
me
feel
a
bit
schizo

well
the
melatonin
was
starting
to
kick
in
which
seemed
to
be
interacting
with
the
remaining
dmt
giving
me
a
somewhat
dissociated
sinking
feeling
which
was
neither
enjoyable
nor
unenjoyable
the
entities
were
still
visible
for
quite
a
while
much
longer
than
i
expected
any
smoked
dmt
trip
to
last
i
tried
to
close
my
eyes
to
see
if
sleep
would
be
possible
soon
and
i
saw
a
strange
mole-like
beast
crawling
its
way
towards
me
with
pretty
sharp
claws
maybe
ten
minutes
after
that
i
was
able
to
close
my
eyes
and
see
nothing
other
than
a
few
colored
blobs
and
i
was
able
to
drift
off
to
sleep
very
easily
id
say
i
was
still
at
a
solid
++
from
the
dmt
until
about
an
hour
after
smoking
it
and
its
hard
to
limit
a
trip
to
a
++
rating
when
there
are
entities
around



i
didnt
get
any
extraordinary
lessons
out
of
this
trip
just
like
all
my
other
dmt
experiences
i
found
all
the
entities
i
encountered
basically
useless
and
distracting
however
i
would
try
to
be
very
careful
setting
expectations
on
any
future
experiments
i
did
find
it
somewhat
recreational
music
euphoria
was
great
visuals
were
beautiful
colors
were
bright
and
the
buzz
feels
nice
on
some
levels
it
was
very
much
like
being
dropped
into
the
peak
of
an
lsd
trip
but
i
find
it
hard
to
relax
around
so
much
strange
life
perhaps
if
i
got
used
to
these
entities
or
they
actually
made
meaningful
contact
with
me
it
would
be
a
different
story

the
best
part
of
the
trip
was
the
experience
of
viewing
and
being
attached
to
the
chrysanthemum
i
believe
i
gained
some
insights
into
the
nature
of
our
purpose
as
human
beings
and
this
trip
has
only
reaffirmed
my
belief
that
death
is
nothing
to
fear
and
humanity
is
but
a
strange
stop
on
our
continuing
journeys




freebase
dmt
was
not
something
i
ever
really
imagined
having
a
chance
to
taste
but
as
with
so
many
of
the
most
profound
and
important
experiences
in
life
it
more
or
less
fell
into
my
lap
and
all
i
had
to
do
all
i
could
do
was
make
the
best
use
of
it
i
could

set
and
setting
alone
in
my
condo
on
a
friday
night
it
had
been
a
long
time
relatively
since
i
had
last
used
psychedelics
in
the
meantime
i
had
been
practicing
meditation
strengthening
and
exploring
my
own
mind
and
spirit
and
making
some
important
steps
forward
with
my
life
i
felt
confident
and
ready
for
anything

on
this
evening
i
had
decided
to
re-attempt
together
two
well-regarded
tryptamines
i
had
tried
before
individually
and
had
had
disappointing
experiences
with
while
still
feeling
there
was
potential
in
to
wit
i
would
be
ingesting
nn-dpt
and
nn-dmt
stacked
on
top
of
each
other
potentiated
with
an
maoi
and
garnished
liberally
with
nitrous
oxide

+000
-
i
predosed
with
150mg
of
moclobemide

i
did
not
plan
to
take
either
tryptamine
orally
so
this
was
largely
a
superfluous
step
but
i
wanted
to
maximize
the
effect
of
both
substances
as
much
as
possible
since
standard
doses
had
not
worked
for
me
in
the
past
note
that
if
either
substance
had
been
an
amphetamine
or
phenethylamine
i
would
emphatically
not
have
used
an
maoi
but
with
tryptamines
as
long
as
i
am
careful
with
dosage
i
have
never
had
ill
effects
with
maois
just
stronger
experiences

+100
-
i
insufflated
roughly
half
of
a
weighed
dose
of
110mg
of
dpt

i
immediately
followed
the
insufflation
with
a
bulb
of
nitrous
to
help
allay
the
burn
and
the
bothersomeness
of
the
drip
i
also
grabbed
a
bottle
of
lemon
juice
and
periodically
squirted
a
bit
down
my
throat
to
counteract
the
drip
as
well
i
find
this
works
wonders
against
the
alkaline
burn

i
sat
down
to
watch
television
as
i
waited
for
the
effects
getting
satellite
tv
and
a
tivo
has
unfortunately
increased
the
quantity
of
my
tv
viewing
im
sad
to
say
but
on
the
other
hand
also
the
quality
in
about
30
minutes
i
felt
the
warm
body
buzz
of
dpt
creeping
in
mild
flowing
visuals
also
began
to
develop
overall
it
was
a
+
maybe
a
++
in
terms
of
my
ability
to
interact
with
reality
but
it
was
such
a
relaxed
almost
sleepy
trip
that
it
didnt
feel
like
a
++
dpt
for
me
has
a
very
sedative
effect
and
i
often
feel
myself
staring
into
space
and
my
eyes
drifting
closed
when
i
take
it
more
like
a
trance
than
like
sleeping
but
still
quite
the
opposite
from
the
hyper-alertness
of
phenethylamine-based
psychedelics

over
the
next
30-40
minutes
i
inhaled
about
20
bulbs
of
nitrous
oxide
rather
than
doing
two
in
rapid
succession
as
i
usually
do
if
im
trying
to
launch
off
into
a
++++
i
just
kept
up
a
steady
pace
of
one
bulb
every
few
minutes
this
eventually
put
me
into
a
very
relaxed
slightly
drunken
state
of
mind
which
combined
with
the
dpt
meant
that
i
was
well
pretty
wasted
psychedelic
effects
aside
i
was
probably
as
out
of
it
as
i
would
be
from
3-4
drinks

before
long
i
felt
ready
to
attempt
the
dmt
as
i
indicated
my
first
two
tries
smoking
50mg
of
dmt
had
been
sore
disappointments
resulting
in
a
brief
trance-like
state
with
some
nice
visuals
but
no
more
than
a
++
which
after
all
the
hype
surrounding
this
drug
was
really
a
bummer

i
queued
up
my
favorite
tripping
playlist
on
itunes
which
i
have
set
to
play
wirelessly
from
my
laptop
through
my
central
stereo
system
courtesy
of
apples
airport
express
i
sat
down
in
my
favorite
chair
and
took
several
deep
breaths
to
center
my
spirit

+215
-
i
placed
80mg
of
dmt
freebase
in
a
pre-warmed
lightbulb
vaporizer
applied
a
butane
torch
waited
until
i
saw
vapor
and
inhaled
three
hits

after
the
third
hit
i
felt
a
heaviness
rapidly
building
up
in
my
limbs
in
a
portentious
rush
i
was
familiar
with
from
5-meo-dmt
i
quickly
put
out
the
torch
and
set
it
and
the
hot
bulb
down
on
a
china
plate
on
the
floor
which
i
had
placed
there
ahead
of
time
to
avoid
setting
fire
to
the
rug
i
sat
back
in
the
chair
and
almost
as
an
afterthought
exhaled
a
big
cloud
of
smoke
that
was
the
last
action
i
took
in
this
universe

before
i
talk
about
what
happened
next
a
quick
observation
the
effects
of
a
high
dose
of
lsd
my
favorite
drug
are
intensely
memorable
gorgeous
soul-plumbing
something
one
wants
to
repeat
again
and
again
partly
because
the
experience
is
so
beautiful
and
at
the
same
time
so
chaotic
and
hard
to
piece
back
together
like
william
jamess
description
of
the
nitrous
trip
as
sobriety
returns
the
feeling
of
insight
fades
and
one
is
left
staring
vacantly
at
a
few
disjointed
words
and
phrases
as
one
stares
at
a
cadaverous-looking
snowpeak
from
which
sunset
glow
has
just
fled
or
at
a
black
cinder
left
by
an
extinguished
brand

dmt
for
me
was
not
like
this
although
the
intensity
of
the
memory
faded
somewhat
in
the
days
that
followed
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
still
remember
almost
every
second
of
the
trip
and
it
was
full
of
intentional
meaning
and
anything
but
chaotic

back
to
me
in
my
chair
surrounded
by
smoke
the
song
playing
on
the
stereo
at
that
moment
was
a
reggae
track
called
free
up
black
man
i
am
not
a
reggae
fan
and
this
selection
was
rather
accidental
i
had
not
thought
to
fast
forward
to
one
of
my
favorite
songs
in
time
for
the
dmt
flash
and
in
hindsight
that
might
have
been
an
improvement
but
i
almost
think
it
was
better
to
be
listening
to
the
haunting
exotic
melodies
of
the
islands
rather
than
something
artificial
electronic
and
acid-like

as
i
exhaled
the
smoke
i
powerfully
noticed
the
way
in
which
the
cone
of
smoke
as
it
left
my
mouth
lined
up
in
perfect
symmetry
between
the
frames
of
two
paintings
hanging
on
the
wall
actually
symmetry
was
suddenly
everywhere
glancing
down
i
saw
the
ornate
patterns
in
the
oriental
rug
organizing
themselves
like
nanobots
into
bigger
and
bigger
clusters
of
units
i
closed
my
eyes
for
a
brief
second
and
behind
my
lids
this
activity
continued
unabated
--
the
entire
universe
was
organizing
itself
falling
into
lines
and
regiments
of
ordered
colored
blocks
all
at
the
command
i
sensed
of
some
master
entity
an
all-powerful
him
yes
it
was
decidedly
male
i
dont
consciously
believe
in
a
male
divinity
but
i
cant
deny
that
aspect
of
this
experience

inside
my
head
i
could
sense
my
synapses
being
corraled
by
the
drug
inside
me
it
was
the
drug
not
him
--
for
the
first
few
seconds
i
went
back
and
forth
between
drug
and
him
as
the
giver
of
my
experience
forced
into
lockstep
with
the
higher
order
of
the
universe
--
no
longer
free
to
be
a
messy
bundle
of
neurons
they
were
lining
up
in
perfect
rows
marching
along
like
soldiers

opening
my
eyes
again
i
began
to
feel
afraid
as
i
saw
this
process
intensifying
and
accelerating
far
beyond
my
ability
to
keep
up
mentally
the
details
of
my
surroundings
became
increasingly
hard
to
discern
--
they
kept
organizing
into
each
other
and
forming
larger
and
larger
aggregate
clusters
of
shape
and
color
the
world
was
going
from
full-color
live
action
detail
to
the
level
of
detail
from
a
scene
in
the
simpsons
i
was
physically
frozen
in
place
unable
to
understand
what
was
happening

simultaneously
the
amber
led
display
on
my
black
stereo
receiver
which
sits
atop
my
tv
and
happened
to
be
in
my
direct
line
of
sight
during
this
open-eyed
trance
became
unreadable
not
blurry
no
if
anything
it
became
crystal
clear
as
if
scales
had
fallen
from
my
eyes
rather
it
was
now
in
an
alien
language
a
twisted
hieroglyph
of
triangles
and
arcane
script
this
text
was
flowing
and
changing
and
flipping
like
the
digits
on
a
scoreboard
to
reveal
new
text
underneath

this
was
all
incredibly
profound
and
i
felt
intensely
honored
and
privileged
to
experience
it
and
yet
it
kept
getting
stronger
and
stronger
*i*
was
being
erased
by
this
sea
of
alien
organization
washing
over
the
universe
and
i
would
soon
cease
to
exist
as
a
separate
entity
my
first
instinct
was
to
fight
against
this
thrashing
my
head
to
the
side
but
i
was
commanded
by
him
to
submit
and
i
could
not
refuse
he
wanted
me
to
keep
looking
open
myself
and
to
be
part
of
him
frozen
in
time
and
place
for
all
eternity

i
opened
my
eyes
again
and
tried
to
calm
myself
and
tell
myself
i
would
not
die
somewhere
deep
deep
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i
knew
i
had
taken
a
drug
and
this
was
not
real
but
this
was
so
far
from
mattering
that
it
really
didnt
count
as
knowledge
but
i
told
myself
as
long
as
i
can
still
hear
the
music
im
still
alive
im
still
in
this
world
time
has
not
stopped
i
am
not
frozen
so
i
grasped
desperately
at
the
music
like
a
drowning
man
with
a
life
preserver

hey
mon
free
up
yeh
mon

the
singer
sounded
miles
away
and
was
getting
further
away
every
second
and
then
his
voice
the
music
all
the
sound
in
my
environment
began
cutting
in
and
out
like
a
bad
cell
phone
connection
the
gaps
between
sounds
getting
longer
and
longer

hey
on

ee
up

ey

uh


eh

total
silence
there
was
no
sound
no
sensory
input
of
any
kind
from
outside
my
body
except
a
cartoon
sketch
of
my
living
room
expunged
of
all
detail
brightly
lit
by
an
otherworldly
light
around
which
my
eyes
looked
wildly
the
last
bits
of
language
in
my
view
the
digits
on
the
stereo
receiver
winked
out
one
by
one
--
that
is
the
black
box
itself
remained
completely
lucid
and
clear
someone
had
just
erased
all
the
text
from
it
one
letter
at
a
time
just
as
the
sound
was
cutting
out
one
syllable
at
a
time
closing
in
on
me
in
a
narrowing
spiral
of
deafness
muteness
and
essentially
blindness
size
and
shape
were
still
allowed
to
me
to
perceive
visually
but
language
and
detail
were
not
i
was
alone
with
him
in
glassy
frozen
silence
for
eternity
all
i
had
to
cling
to
was
the
defeaning
sound
of
my
own
frantic
breathing
a
desperate
sucking
for
life
in
a
vaccuum
like
the
astronauts
in
their
space
suits
in
2001
a
space
odyssey

and
then
and
then
the
singer
and
his
musicians
began
to
break
through
the
silence
singing
to
me
from
eons
away
free
up
stand
up
carry
on
you
got
to
staa-aaaa-aand
like
grass
and
rocks
emerging
from
beneath
melting
snow
the
visual
details
of
the
room
began
to
well
up
from
behind
the
pristine
surface
of
his
frozen
universe

hallelujah
the
exhiliration
of
this
moment
was
like
nothing
i
have
ever
experienced
on
any
drug
anywhere
it
was
to
touch
god
i
had
come
through
his
realm
and
returned
to
my
own
reborn
with
more
knowledge
and
wisdom
than
i
had
ever
though
i
could
contain

the
receiver
on
top
of
the
tv
came
to
life
not
until
later
did
i
read
about
other
peoples
dmt
trips
that
have
also
contained
mechanical
elves
which
this
certainly
was
it
was
an
emissary
from
him
and
it
tipped
its
hat
to
me
and
grinned
the
way
wacky
cartoon
cars
grin
with
their
front
grills
as
mouths
it
jumped
up
and
down
on
its
little
steel
legs
in
time
to
the
music
baring
its
teeth
in
a
ferocious
smile
at
me
and
nodding
yes
yes
this
is
real
my
friend
oh
yes
yes
this
is
real
my
friend
this
is
actually
happening
you
have
been
there
where
so
few
others
have
been
allowed
to
go
can
you
believe
it
man
can
you
believe
it
ohhhh
man
now
celebrate
boy

i
was
back
i
hugged
myself
rocked
back
and
forth
laughing
by
now
the
visuals
were
truly
insane
having
completely
broken
out
of
their
previously
frozen
hierarchy
of
organization
i
was
blinded
by
swirling
masses
of
purple
and
yellow
and
chains
of
stars
by
the
clock
several
minutes
went
by
and
i
must
have
essentially
blacked
out
because
i
dont
remember
much
of
it
this
part
of
the
trip
was
indistinguishable
to
me
from
a
hard
acid
trip
--
just
spacing
out
in
a
sea
of
visions
and
thought
loops

at
one
point
i
sat
up
in
the
chair
and
a
second
flash
hit
me
a
kind
of
aftershock
that
was
a
pale
echo
of
the
original
flash
this
one
had
much
more
of
a
noticeable
body
load
with
hypertension
and
for
a
second
i
was
afraid
thinking
i
cant
handle
another
trip
right
now
ill
have
a
heart
attack
but
i
took
a
deep
breath
and
it
passed
quickly
enough

+230
-
400
-
i
came
down

the
rest
of
the
evening
was
pretty
scattered
i
wandered
around
the
apartment
laughing
and
saying
stupid
stuff
like
oh
my
god
and
damn
and
holy
shit
and
feeling
incredibly
grateful
and
excited
to
have
made
contact
with
the
higher
power
behind
dmt
although
i
am
not
a
religious
person
i
find
it
impossible
not
to
have
some
tiny
part
of
me
say
you
met
god
that
night

it
was
pretty
much
impossible
to
tell
when
the
dmt
trailed
off
since
the
dpt
was
still
in
effect
at
some
point
after
much
back-and-forth
i
decided
to
snort
the
remaining
50mg
of
dpt
and
i
finished
off
another
box
of
nitrous
bulbs
but
this
was
pretty
much
a
waste
of
material
nothing
else
could
be
in
the
least
memorable
in
the
hours
following
the
dmt
voyage

as
an
aside
when
i
thought
about
it
later
i
realized
the
visuals
from
dmt
are
extremely
reminiscent
of
incan
and
mayan
architecture
ziggurats
etc
the
whole
concept
of
reality
organizing
into
a
geometrical
regularity
that
ascends
upward
to
god
suddenly
made
a
huge
amount
of
sense
to
me
after
this
experience
of
course
the
huasca-drinkers
who
experienced
this
same
effect
centuries
ago
and
attributed
it
to
god
had
it
replicated
in
their
religious
artifacts
and
architecture

in
terms
of
side
effects
i
did
have
a
bit
of
a
headache
for
a
while
like
i
always
get
after
smoking
5-meo-dmt
and
the
dpt
gave
me
some
intestinal
problems
other
than
that
this
was
a
clean
clean
trip

in
the
days
afterward
i
felt
like
i
had
finally
experienced
what
psychedelic
trips
are
really
all
about
i
was
unsure
how
satisfied
i
would
ever
be
again
with
average
trips
this
was
a
once-in-a-lifetime
experience
and
if
i
happen
to
be
so
fortunate
as
to
have
a
second
chance
to
delve
this
deep
into
dmt
well
i
will
certainly
not
pass
it
up





dmt
and
the
origin
of
the
psychedelic
experience
-
a
retrospective<br/><br/>dimethyltryptamine
dmt
is
an
alkaloid
that
is
found
in
many
plants
it
has
a
profound
effect
on
the
human
brain
via
its
action
as
a
serotonin
receptor
agonist
giving
it
the
ability
to
induce
powerful
psychedelic
states
it
also
together
with
psilocybin
mushrooms
has
a
long
history
of
human
use
and
is
an
active
component
in
traditional
ayahuasca
brews
which
originate
with
the
shamans
of
the
amazon<br/><br/>in
this
retrospective
i
first
talk
about
the
dmt
experience
including
my
own
experiments
with
this
substance
i
then
go
on
to
compare
it
with
other
psychedelics
talk
extensively
about
the
neurological
origins
of
psychedelic
states
and
finally
discuss
the
question
of
their
objective
reality<br/>


while
i
have
sampled
various
psychedelic
drugs
over
the
years
i
always
felt
afraid
of
dmt
i
thought
that
i
would
never
try
it
because
of
its
reputation
for
bringing
on
overwhelming
experiences
it
sounded
too
intense
i
have
experienced
a
number
of
anxiety
attacks
under
the
influence
of
lsd
or
mushrooms
and
i
thought
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
handle
something
with
such
an
extreme
effect
additionally
i
am
very
sensitive
to
psychedelics
and
doses
listed
online
are
typically
much
too
high
for
me
despite
these
concerns
i
remained
highly
interested
in
trying
dmt
eventually

at
some
point
in
2011
the
opportunity
arose
to
try
dmt
at
just
the
right
time
where
i
was
feeling
adventurous
but
relaxed
in
a
great
setting
i
decided
to
give
it
a
go
having
had
no
experience
before
of
this
substance
i
was
lucky
that
the
dose
was
at
about
the
right
level
for
a
full-on
first
time
exposure
because
getting
the
right
dose
with
dmt
is
often
problematic

i
took
a
hit
of
a
dmt
pipe
and
held
my
breath
for
a
few
seconds
i
had
just
enough
time
to
focus
on
passing
the
pipe
back
and
breathing
out
and
then
back
in
to
get
a
lungful
of
air

i
had
just
enough
time
to
focus
on
passing
the
pipe
back
and
breathing
out
and
then
back
in
to
get
a
lungful
of
air

after
that
i
pretty
much
lost
touch
with
my
body
i
remember
saying
wow
a
lot
of
rainbows
it
felt
like
a
weight
pressed
me
down
into
the
ground
while
a
rapidly
increasing
set
of
psychedelic
visions
built
up
to
an
intensity
that
i
had
never
experienced
before
and
i
entered
a
complex
animated
neon
room
of
incredible
machine-like
digital
impressions
i
was
feeling
completely
astonished
and
thinking
how
can
this
be
possible

quickly
i
was
overtaken
by
the
thought
that
this
was
not
really
a
drug
but
that
i
was
actually
being
yanked
forcibly
into
other
dimensions
i
became
a
completely
dissociated
speck
of
consciousness
in
a
vast
spherical
mandala
of
vibrant
color
and
patterns
strangely
i
felt
that
my
rational
mind
was
preserved
through
this
roller-coaster
ride
i
moved
rapidly
past
the
resonant
mandala
state
into
a
wide
open
landscape
and
felt
that
i
was
flying
through
the
air
over
a
coastline
and
above
a
beach
constructed
out
of
beautiful
flowing
fractal
imagery
-
it
was
a
fully
immersive
all-encompassing
experience
with
no
perception
of
my
physical
body

it
seemed
that
there
were
entities
there
that
were
very
happy
to
see
me
arrive
telling
me
that
they
had
been
waiting
for
me
although
not
in
fact
visible
and
only
felt
as
presences
they
seemed
like
alien
parents
and
i
felt
like
a
newborn
baby
or
a
fish
out
of
water
flopping
around
and
very
much
confused
and
astounded
they
seemed
eager
to
try
to
show
me
strange
art
and
other
things
in
such
rapid
succession
that
i
could
barely
take
it
in
and
they
gave
me
a
strong
feeling
of
love
and
encouragement
they
were
pleased
that
i
had
finally
made
it
to
this
place


it
was
around
this
point
that
someone
from
the
real
world
started
talking
to
me
and
i
opened
my
eyes
and
snapped
back
to
earth
later
i
was
dancing
to
some
music
and
it
seemed
like
every
move
i
made
had
multiple
complex
geometric
reverberating
patterns
associated
with
it
the
dose
must
have
been
fairly
high
as
i
was
feeling
the
effects
for
around
45
minutes


i
was
very
excited
after
this
overwhelming
ride
and
i
felt
very
positive
but
also
a
little
disconnected
i
began
to
realize
that
i
was
one
of
relatively
few
people
who
had
been
to
this
place
and
it
was
hard
to
know
what
to
do
with
it
and
how
to
mentally
and
emotionally
integrate
this
information
what
was
interesting
about
my
experience
was
that
because
i
did
not
intend
to
take
dmt
i
had
never
read
in
detail
any
trip
reports
and
so
i
did
not
realize
until
i
got
home
that
my
own
experience
was
pretty
much
the
archetypal
dmt
narrative

i
had
a
fairly
hard
time
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
going
back
to
work
and
thinking
about
it
all
the
time
i
realize
now
that
this
is
why
the
traditional
role
of
a
shaman
or
experienced
drug
guide
is
important
because
you
need
someone
to
talk
to
who
knows
about
the
experience
and
can
help
you
work
it
all
out
in
your
own
head
there
are
very
few
of
those
people
in
western
society
i
felt
in
a
zone
of
being
disconnected
from
ordinary
people
and
especially
locked
in
an
internal
battle
over
how
much
was
externally
real
about
the
experience
and
how
much
was
in
my
head
-
just
a
change
of
brain
function
brought
about
by
taking
a
drug
this
is
a
constant
theme
in
dmt
discussions

after
that
first
time
i
became
quite
experienced
with
dmt
taking
it
on
multiple
occasions
although
it
was
always
with
some
trepidation
and
it
never
seemed
like
something
that
i
wanted
to
do
very
often
as
a
scientist
i
became
interested
in
cataloging
and
examining
the
effects
of
dmt
as
i
varied
the
dose

i
have
tried
a
few
times
smoking
dmt
repeatedly
from
a
glass
vaporizing
pipe
over
the
course
of
a
couple
of
hours
which
is
hard
on
the
lungs
because
it
tastes
so
awful
but
it
does
give
a
slow
burn
of
dmt
intoxication
that
allows
you
to
approximately
control
the
level
dipping
above
and
below
the
comfort
zone
with
each
toke
this
makes
it
easier
to
acclimatize
to
the
effects
and
observe
progressively
higher
doses

one
could
perhaps
take
dmt
intravenously
with
saline
in
a
continuos
manner
to
maintain
a
steady
level
although
presumably
someone
would
have
to
facilitate
this
experiment
in
a
medical
setting



the
nice
thing
about
dmt
is
that
it
is
so
rapidly
metabolized
which
allows
me
the
confidence
to
know
that
it
will
be
over
soon
if
i
get
to
a
difficult
place

next
i
want
to
talk
a
bit
more
about
the
effects
that
i
experience
at
lower
doses
and
then
compare
it
to
experiences
with
other
psychedelics
especially
psilocybin
mushrooms

im
also
going
to
talk
about
the
neuroscience
and
the
debate
about
the
reality
of
dmt
spaces



there
is
sort
of
a
hallowed
feeling
to
the
dmt
experience
as
though
i
have
entered
a
large
space
like
a
cathedral
in
part
this
might
be
related
to
the
echoey
effect
of
the
audio
distortions
with
my
eyes
open
everything
begins
to
look
very
flat
or
cartoon-like
such
that
the
interior
shading
to
walls
and
objects
is
missing
or
washed
out
and
just
the
edges
are
maintained
similar
to
the
rotoscoping
effect
from
the
movie
a
scanner
darkly
i
also
have
the
same
experience
on
psilocybin
mushrooms

with
stronger
doses
the
visual
edges
of
things
start
breaking
open
to
reveal
bright
rainbow-colored
fractal
noise
specifically
when
i
am
going
up
on
either
dmt
or
mushrooms
contours
in
the
visual
field
-
edges
of
walls
or
chairs
or
other
edges
in
normal
visual
perception
-
seem
to
split
in
color
and
become
rainbow
edges
leaving
behind
patterned
tracers
and
becoming
the
sources
that
unfold
into
a
more
complex
psychedelic
experience

the
auditory
effects
for
me
involve
tinkly
metallic
sounds
like
someone
dropping
ball
bearings
on
an
infinite
metallic
plate
or
a
crackling
sound
like
crumpling
up
mylar
i
also
experience
quiet
phaser
sounds
like
little
baby
ray
guns
going
off
sometimes
longer
and
shorter
but
with
a
falling
pitch
not
made
of
a
pure
tone
but
made
of
pink
noise
interestingly
i
find
the
sounds
quite
similar
to
audio-domain
recordings
of
very
low
frequency
radio
noise
caused
by
distant
thunderstorms
these
sounds
called
spherics
are
the
result
of
dispersing
radio
waves
bouncing
around
in
the
ionosphere
and
can
be
picked
up
by
a
special
radio

im
not
suggesting
that
the
brain
picks
up
these
signals
but
i
do
think
the
mathematical
mechanism
of
frequency-domain
smearing
of
noise
bursts
may
be
common
to
both
of
these
phenomena
particularly
as
this
is
very
much
the
analysis
that
the
brain
is
doing
in
the
auditory
system
-
dividing
sound
into
a
number
of
frequency
bands

with
my
eyes
closed
i
start
to
see
patterns
that
consist
of
neon
or
laser-bright
lines
of
intense
red
green
blue
or
yellow
in
geometric
structures
that
seem
to
pop
in
and
out
or
move
in
a
digital
fashion
presented
in
a
vast
space
which
i
call
the
electric
room
these
patterns
seem
to
be
always
moving
and
fitting
into
each
other
like
tetris
blocks
or
coming
and
going
into
and
out
of
alignment
or
else
queueing
up
and
being
released
like
those
speeded
up
videos
of
cars
moving
through
city
intersection
stop
lights
from
the
movie
baraka
the
sounds
also
seem
to
synchronize
with
these
motions
other
patterns
i
have
experienced
include
intricate
evolving
3d
fractals
and
flitting
3d
tracers
like
the
changing
structures
of
light
in
a
plasma
globe

the
initial
body
sensations
consist
of
a
heavy
downward
pressure
that
seems
like
weighty
geometric
patterns
of
touch
pressing
down
over
my
chest
and
arms

the
initial
body
sensations
consist
of
a
heavy
downward
pressure
that
seems
like
weighty
geometric
patterns
of
touch
pressing
down
over
my
chest
and
arms

so
i
feel
like
i
am
being
vacuum-sealed
in
chicken
wire
or
some
patterned
membrane
is
pressing
on
my
body
this
really
accentuates
the
feeling
that
some
outside
agent
is
doing
something
to
me
\x97
along
the
lines
of
sleep
paralysis
experiences
or
alien
abductions
however
it
probably
has
its
origin
in
structured
patterns
of
touch
hallucinations
that
arise
within
somatosensory
cortex
and
are
experienced
as
though
mapped
onto
the
body
surface
in
the
same
manner
as
the
visual
cortex
is
involved
in
visual
hallucinations
these
patterns
of
pressure
points
on
my
body
and
face
seem
to
rapidly
move
around
as
if
my
body
is
a
skating
rink
and
lots
of
miniature
but
heavy
skaters
are
tooling
around
on
it
in
a
haphazard
fashion

with
progressively
larger
doses
i
experience
a
growing
disconnect
from
my
body
sometimes
with
a
loss
of
spatial
awareness
and
the
idea
of
the
direction
of
gravity
it
is
a
bit
like
when
you
go
camping
and
lie
on
your
back
and
look
up
at
the
stars
and
imagine
yourself
oriented
vertically
and
looking
out
horizontally
from
a
vast
wall
which
is
the
earth
your
normal
embodied
presence
seems
to
fade
out
and
spatial
directions
become
ambiguous
this
is
also
quite
similar
to
the
experience
of
ketamine
intoxication

with
regards
to
what
people
often
call
the
body
load
of
the
psychedelic
it
seems
like
dmt
has
a
feathery
light
quality
to
it
without
a
lot
of
tension
or
waves
of
difficult
muscle
contractions
or
gastrointestinal
spasms
like
the
ones
that
one
can
get
on
lsd
cannabis
sativa
or
2c-b
it
seems
to
be
rather
more
sleep-inducing
than
stimulating
certainly
less
stimulating
than
lsd
with
very
little
restlessness
or
desire
to
get
up
and
move
around
i
have
felt
like
i
have
fallen
asleep
taking
dmt
late
at
night

with
larger
doses
everything
i
experience
seems
to
open
up
into
multiple
things
in
some
kind
of
chaotic
fractal
period
doubling
at
some
critical
moment
i
pass
a
point
of
total
disembodiment
where
the
visual
field
and
perhaps
all
sensation
becomes
a
vast
and
static
brightly
colored
mandala
-
a
saturated
feedback
point
or
stable
eigenvector
of
sensation
like
standing
waves
of
color
and
structure
like
fine
powder
patterns
on
a
metal
plate
vibrating
in
a
sound
field
or
like
the
resonance
of
a
bell

this
tends
to
be
the
moment
where
i
really
jump
off
into
alternative
worlds
it
is
the
point
where
i
am
forced
to
give
up
trying
to
pay
attention
to
specific
senses
and
instead
i
enter
a
pan-dimensional
psychedelic
dreaming
it
is
no
longer
shapes
and
colors
but
concepts
and
images
of
alien
places
and
landscapes
cities
or
machines
and
there
starts
to
be
a
narrative
to
it
as
opposed
to
a
simple
temporal
motion
structure
there
seems
to
be
a
certain
characteristic
evolving
pace
to
everything
and
while
the
content
changes
this
pace
nevertheless
remains
constant
there
is
also
the
possibility
of
feeling
extremely
strong
emotions
like
feeling
incredible
love
or
ecstatic
states
presumably
also
fear
or
malevolence
however
i
personally
have
never
felt
that
way
to
date


it
is
hard
to
tell
how
much
of
this
content
is
common
from
individual
to
individual

i
am
a
very
visually
oriented
person
and
so
i
experience
and
describe
very
intense
visual
phenomena

presumably
if
you
are
a
professional
composer
of
music
you
might
have
many
more
auditory
experiences
than
i
have
described
here
or
a
different
person
might
experience
more
interpersonal
narratives


i
know
people
who
say
they
barely
ever
experience
visuals
even
on
dmt
-
so
called
dmt
non-responders
who
may
have
a
somewhat
different
distribution
or
density
of
certain
types
of
serotonin
receptors
than
more
responsive
individuals


it
is
interesting
to
compare
the
effects
of
dmt
to
those
of
other
tryptamines
for
example
lsd
and
psilocybin
mushrooms
these
three
have
a
lot
of
similar
qualities
but
differ
in
the
time
course
and
the
level
of
physical
stimulation
that
one
experiences
meaning
the
need
to
move
around
with
dmt
being
less
stimulating
than
lsd
also
there
is
a
different
confusion
factor
for
each
which
i
would
define
as
the
amount
of
sensory
distortion
experienced
for
the
same
level
of
executive
function
loss
executive
function
being
the
ability
to
make
decisions
and
maintain
a
feeling
of
control


one
of
the
nice
things
about
dmt
is
that
it
produces
a
great
deal
of
sensory
distortion
but
at
the
core
i
can
almost
feel
sober
and
able
to
rationally
experience
what
is
happening
even
at
fairly
high
levels
of
bodily
disconnection
eventually
with
a
large
dose
it
is
possible
to
disassociate
and
experience
ego
loss
and
the
understanding
of
who
or
where
i
am
lsd
however
seems
to
produce
confusion
more
rapidly
with
dose
and
it
becomes
difficult
to
maintain
any
train
of
thought
mushrooms
are
somewhere
in
the
middle


i
would
speculate
that
what
is
probably
going
on
here
is
that
lsd
being
a
wide
spectrum
agonist
at
a
number
of
neural
receptors
has
a
broad
effect
across
the
brain
interfering
with
executive
functions
in
the
frontal
lobes
as
much
as
sensory
processing
whereas
dmt
probably
has
its
main
effect
on
receptor
sub-types
that
are
densely
present
in
sensory
cortex
and
only
at
higher
doses
begins
to
upset
the
functioning
of
the
whole
brain<br/><br/>the
study
psychedelics
and
the
human
receptorome
ray
2010
while
his
results
have
been
hotly
debated
provides
us
with
interesting
data
about
receptor
binding
affinities
of
various
psychedelic
drugs
from
this
we
can
get
an
idea
of
the
differences
between
lsd
dmt
and
psilocybin
psilocin
in
terms
of
how
they
interact
with
receptors
in
the
brain
according
to
this
study
lsd
has
the
broadest
affinity
for
most
serotonin
and
all
dopamine
receptor
types
while
dmt
and
psilocin
both
have
effects
at
a
more
limited
range
of
serotonin
receptors
and
have
an
affinity
for
the
d1
dopamine
receptor
the
main
lesson
is
that
these
are
not
simple
linear
compounds
activating
one
site
eg
5ht2a
but
possess
a
complex
spectrum
of
action
more
studies
are
needed
to
pin
down
the
specifics
of
the
receptor
binding
data
and
to
determine
activation
efficacies
so
that
we
can
know
how
strongly
these
substances
actually
modulate
neural
responses
once
they
are
bound
to
receptors<br/><br/>with
regards
to
the
stimulant
properties
of
psychedelics
i
think
there
is
always
an
adrenaline
component
which
is
associated
with
the
anticipation
or
excitement
about
taking
a
substance
and
the
strangeness
of
the
states
that
are
experienced
\x97
especially
with
novices
with
the
various
drugs
that
people
take
this
can
add
to
whatever
background
effect
the
substance
has
on
the
body
specifically
mushrooms
and
dmt
dont
in
themselves
have
a
strong
stimulant
effect
and
dont
create
that
stay\x97awake\x97all\x97night
feeling
that
primarily
adrenergic
drugs
like
doi
or
many
phenylethylamines
might
possess
as
a
result
they
are
probably
safer
and
can
be
tolerated
in
higher
doses
to
the
extent
that
greater
cognitive
distortions
are
possible
with
the
same
safety
margin
i
think
that
when
over-stimulation
happens
with
mushrooms
it
is
more
because
of
immediate
experience
or
scare
factor
where
the
body
sensations
are
perceived
as
out
of
the
ordinary
and
uncomfortable
making
a
person
more
anxious
or
worked
up
its
more
of
a
content
related
stimulus
than
anything
caused
by
direct
and
constant
action
on
sympathetic
nervous
system
receptors
<br/><br/>it
is
easy
to
get
into
an
overstimulated
and
agitated
state
with
mushrooms
when
situations
around
you
are
non-ideal
but
when
relaxed
and
happy
they
dont
seem
to
be
strongly
stimulating
and
are
almost
sedating
in
some
way
often
giving
you
the
yawns
and
making
you
feel
somewhat
tired
compare
that
with
trip
reports
of
drugs
with
a
somewhat
heavier
background
stimulation
level
even
relatively
mild
phenylethylamines
such
as
2c-b
can
turn
into
one
long
anxiety
attack
at
higher
than
average
doses<br/><br/>people
have
been
known
to
take
mega-doses
of
lsd
-
the
lsd
powder
thumbprint
certainly
lsd
is
stimulating
but
reports
of
experiences
of
such
large
doses
show
that
for
the
first
hour
or
so
there
was
extreme
anxiety
but
after
a
while
the
sympathetic
recruitment
effects
are
less
as
the
person
became
more
confused
this
may
be
because
great
anticipatory
fear
is
felt
at
the
beginning
but
later
the
cognitive
machinery
is
so
affected
that
conceptualizing
the
fear
factor
becomes
impossible
and
the
process
of
continuously
imagining
specific
negative
scenarios
that
typically
drives
an
anxiety
state
is
no
longer
sustainable
leaving
only
the
residual
pharmacological
adrenal
stimulation
of
the
lsd
which
is
not
dangerously
high
i
do
not
advocate
taking
mega
doses
of
lsd


regarding
sensory
distortions
my
experience
with
dmt
and
mushrooms
is
that
they
produce
approximately
the
same
styles
of
visuals
when
normalized
to
dose
only
with
a
different
time
course
the
experience
is
unlike
lsd
or
2c-b
i
experience
closed-eye
patterns
of
neon-like
primary
colored
geometric
wave
fronts
moving
across
the
eyelids
i
can
lay
back
and
allow
these
waves
of
color
and
pattern
to
pass
over
my
sensorium
including
waves
moving
over
my
body
it
feels
like
a
complex
fluctuating
around
a
relatively
mildly
stimulated
sober
state
rather
than
a
strong
energizing
wave
with
any
unpleasant
energizing
depth
more
like
an
overgrowth
of
strange
fractal
fuzz
on
the
senses
that
gets
more
insistent
with
dose


when
smoked
dmt
creates
a
rapid
and
therefore
intense
experience
which
is
hard
to
follow
whereas
mushrooms
give
rise
to
a
slow
experience
that
lasts
a
few
hours
where
i
get
plenty
of
time
to
think
about
the
effects
that
i
am
experiencing
with
mushrooms
most
people
do
not
choose
to
get
to
the
extremes
of
intense
psychedelic
states
that
they
would
normally
have
with
a
few
seconds
of
dmt
the
feeling
of
assurance
that
you
will
quickly
be
sober
after
taking
dmt
allows
a
person
to
take
much
more
of
a
risk
with
dose
and
therefore
experience
a
much
greater
psychical
disturbance
in
other
words
we
can
tolerate
a
very
intense
psychedelic
experience
when
it
is
just
for
a
few
minutes
but
not
when
we
know
it
will
be
hours
before
a
return
to
normal
the
psychedelic
visionary
terence
mckenna
has
stated
that
he
experienced
very
dmt
like
voyages
when
taking
heroic
doses
of
mushrooms
personally
i
do
not
have
any
experience
with
ayahuasca
but
it
would
be
interesting
to
compare
it
with
a
mushroom
trip
because
of
the
similar
time
courses
the
harmaline
ingredient
of
the
ayahuasca
brew
is
psychoactive
and
may
bring
its
own
component
to
the
experience<br/><br/>the
psychedelic
effect
in
general
is
a
bizarre
beast
and
one
that
needs
explaining
improved
understanding
in
this
area
also
has
the
potential
to
lead
to
better
theories
of
cognition
for
a
long
time
our
ideas
of
psychedelic
mechanism
has
revolved
around
the
serotonin
5ht2a
receptor
many
research
publications
talk
as
though
activating
this
receptor
is
the
sole
mode
of
psychedelic
action
i
think
this
is
starting
to
change
as
scientists
realize
that
psychedelic
substances
typically
have
a
broad
influence
at
a
number
of
serotonin
receptor
sub-types
in
the
brain
and
also
involve
effects
at
many
other
sites
including
dopamine
norepeniphrine
or
opiate
receptors
or
at
re-uptake
transporters
this
spectrum
of
action
accounts
for
the
variety
of
subjective
qualities
across
the
different
substances
that
people
take
recreationally<br/><br/>the
cortical
circuits
maintain
a
fine
homeostasis
in
order
to
optimize
the
signal
to
noise
ratio
of
their
representations
of
sensory
information
-
to
rapidly
find
the
things
that
are
relevant
in
a
continuous
onslaught
of
data
this
provides
a
survival
advantage
where
the
brain
tries
to
compute
the
most
likely
hypothesis
of
what
is
actually
taking
place
in
the
world
it
has
evolved
to
provide
fast
and
accurate
perceptions
for
potentially
life
and
death
decision
making
under
sober
conditions
the
cortex
computes
stable
invariant
representations
of
the
rapidly
changing
sensory
patterns
so
that
you
can
recognize
for
example
a
car
at
different
distances
under
different
lighting
conditions
and
under
different
viewing
angles
-
a
level
of
stability
which
is
remarkable
in
the
face
of
huge
changes
in
the
pattern
of
light
entering
the
eye
there
is
a
sort
of
winner-take-all
process
taking
place
where
secondary
hypotheses
of
what
is
seen
are
suppressed
and
the
most
likely
interpretations
are
passed
on
to
later
processing
stages
when
multiple
simultaneous
hypotheses
have
equal
strength
such
as
in
the
necker
cube
illusion
the
interpretation
of
the
image
flips
between
stable
states
at
random<br/><br/>one
action
of
psychedelics
is
to
upset
the
balance
of
this
system
perhaps
by
changing
activation
thresholds
adding
noise
or
reducing
competition
among
neurons
and
this
allows
a
shifting
landscape
of
multiple
weaker
hypotheses
about
sensory
data
to
pass
through
and
be
available
for
direct
perception
one
can
always
stare
at
clouds
and
see
cloud
animals
but
during
psychedelic
experiences
these
secondary
interpretations
have
a
high
saliency
and
are
experienced
directly
and
without
effort
one
therefore
experiences
a
proliferation
of
interpretations
of
sensory
patterns
beyond
the
most
probable
modes
there
are
many
more
ways
to
slice
the
pie
than
first
meet
the
eye
the
population
of
neural
activation
that
encodes
sensory
information
becomes
multi\x97modal
or
has
a
lower
sparsity
than
during
the
sober
state
<br/><br/>the
excitatory
and
inhibitory
clusters
of
neurons
in
the
neocortex
actually
form
complex
dynamic
systems
which
are
capable
of
oscillatory
behaviors
neighboring
neurons
are
highly
connected
and
this
provides
a
substrate
under
which
quite
complex
oscillatory
patterns
can
exist
as
a
normal
part
of
perception
one
can
think
of
regions
of
the
cortex
in
terms
of
a
sea
of
coupled
oscillators
with
non\x97linear
dynamics
i
believe
that
the
pattern
of
activation
of
the
set
of
serotonin
receptors
caused
by
the
drug
can
subtly
change
the
parameters
of
this
system
so
that
it
supports
characteristic
waves
of
depolarization
which
move
like
ripples
on
a
pond
these
passing
waves
will
sometimes
raise
and
sometimes
lower
the
local
thresholds
for
neural
firing
in
fact
such
spontaneous
traveling
waves
of
neural
activation
have
recently
been
shown
to
exist
under
normal
circumstances
in
the
visual
cortex
during
blank
periods
between
significant
visual
stimulation
sato
nauhaus
and

2012
it
is
likely
that
these
natural
waves
become
amplified
during
psychedelic
states
and
take
on
drug\x97dependent
dynamics<br/><br/>such
spatiotemporal
waves
are
a
little
like
seizure
activity
except
they
do
not
grow
without
bound
and
are
unlikely
to
be
able
to
recruit
large
groups
of
neurons
en
masse
but
instead
modulate
the
sensitivity
of
the
neural
substrate
to
ongoing
activity
one
perceives
waves
of
activity
in
motion
across
the
visual
field
or
waves
of
touch
or
muscle
stimulation
often
people
talk
of
waves
of
energy
or
current
flowing
through
their
bodies
while
taking
psychedelics
the
waves
of
electrical
activity
within
the
cortical
surface
are
perceived
as
being
mapped
onto
the
body
producing
amplified
zones
of
sensitivity
over
constantly
changing
regions
of
the
senses
or
moving
waves
of
increased
muscle
tone
which
can
involve
either
skeletal
muscles
or
smooth
muscles
of
the
digestive
tract
these
motor
waves
produce
an
evolution
of
tensing
or
relaxing
both
of
internal
organs
and
muscles
throughout
the
body
which
are
experienced
as
energy
flow
or
body
load<br/><br/>i
would
imagine
that
the
exact
dynamic
behavior
of
these
waves
depends
on
the
pattern
of
psychedelic
substance
binding
activity
across
the
different
receptor
sub\x97types
this
binding
profile
dictates
a
specific
alteration
of
the
spatiotemporal
characteristics
of
local
neural
ensembles
one
could
explain
the
proliferating
perceptual
hypotheses
of
psychedelic
states
in
terms
of
a
raising
or
lowering
of
activation
thresholds
as
each
wave
passes
by
sometimes
increasing
and
sometimes
decreasing
the
likelihood
that
a
particular
set
of
neurons
will
fire
and
thereby
changing
the
balance
of
salient
perceptions<br/><br/>most
people
prefer
psychedelics
with
low
body
load
i
think
that
what
people
mean
by
this
is
that
they
do
not
want
a
strong
stimulating
effect
at
muscles
or
within
the
gastrointestinal
tract
shakes
excessive
muscle
tone
poor
coordination
or
convulsions
are
not
generally
desired
and
neither
are
gastrointestinal
spasms
and
frequent
trips
to
the
bathroom
gut
pain
and
tension
often
leads
to
anxiety
states
as
dose
is
increased
distortions
of
perception
eventually
lead
to
confusion
and
then
to
shaking
and
seizures
during
overdose
reflecting
the
likely
spreading
of
activation
beyond
sensory
cortex
and
into
the
frontal
lobes
and
eventually
motor
cortex
recruiting
networks
in
the
whole
brain
possibly
the
density
of
receptors
upon
which
the
drugs
act
is
different
between
these
cortical
areas
with
large
distortions
of
perception
being
possible
for
some
drugs
especially
in
the
case
of
dmt
but
with
minimal
stimulation
of
muscle
tension
or
movement
because
motor
neurons
are
not
easily
recruited<br/>
<br/>one
interesting
aspect
of
dmt
and
mushrooms
is
the
cartoon\x97like
experience
of
normal
surroundings
the
visual
system
seems
to
suffer
a
reduction
in
contrast
sensitivity
so
that
low
contrast
details
between
visual
boundaries
are
lost
to
perception
this
could
fit
in
with
the
almost
paradoxical
mixed
sedation
and
psychedelic
activation
that
people
experience
on
dmt
there
may
be
a
diffuse
background
hyper-polarization
of
neurons
reduced
sensitivity
to
inputs
\x97
or
partial
sleep
state
upon
which
dynamic
waves
of
increased
hallucinatory
activation
are
impressed
this
would
be
similar
to
near-sleep
states
where
neurons
are
hyperpolarized
but
exhibit
transient
bursting
modes
of
activity
and
there
is
a
build
up
of
strong
eeg
waves
instead
of
the
regular
and
relatively
desynchronized
firing
during
wakefulness
in
response
to
sensory
stimuli
weyand
et
al
2001<br/><br/>it
is
also
common
to
experience
fractals
a
fact
which
bears
some
consideration
especially
as
it
seems
like
fractals
are
highly
artificial
patterns
which
present
as
a
surprising
emergent
property
of
altered
visual
perception
however
if
one
considers
the
structure
of
the
neural
processing
stages
in
human
vision
it
becomes
easier
to
see
that
fractals
could
be
an
outcome
of
psychedelic
intoxication
<br/><br/>it
is
well
known
that
the
brain
carries
out
a
series
of
processing
steps
which
start
with
the
analysis
of
small
regions
or
details
of
the
visual
image
and
proceeds
sequentially
via
multiple
neural
layers
to
amalgamate
information
over
progressively
larger
regions
the
brain
eventually
produces
patterns
of
response
that
are
drawn
from
the
whole
visual
field
during
this
processing
the
visual
cortex
constructs
a
multi\x97scale
or
scale\x97space
representation
which
is
part
of
the
mechanism
by
which
the
neural
apparatus
is
able
to
recognize
the
same
object
at
different
sizes
and
positions
in
the
field
of
view
thus
we
have
a
hierarchy
of
processing
steps
from
retinal
pixels
to
neurons
that
encode
stable
semantic
information
what
is
not
often
considered
is
that
information
flows
both
upwards
and
downwards
and
neurons
in
later
stages
send
their
results
back
down
to
their
input
stages
-
stages
which
are
more
closely
coupled
to
the
eyes
this
creates
a
sort
of
feedback
loop
\x97
a
dynamic
system
which
operates
between
coarse
and
fine
spatial
scales
and
between
the
perceptions
of
the
whole
and
the
parts<br/><br/>the
property
that
defines
fractals
is
their
self-similarity
between
different
scales
a
complete
fractal
is
made
up
of
smaller
copies
of
itself
if
a
spontaneous
pattern
that
is
present
at
a
high
level
of
visual
processing
can
be
impressed
multiple
times
onto
lower
levels
with
the
same
pattern
resonating
up
and
down
the
hierarchy
at
different
apparent
size
scales
then
fractal
forms
may
naturally
result
in
a
simplistic
example
you
could
think
of
this
as
being
a
little
bit
like
video
feedback
where
a
camera
is
trained
on
a
television
which
shows
images
of
itself
morphing
patterns
ensue<br/><br/>under
normal
conditions
the
brain
very
finely
controls
the
balance
between
bottom-up
information
flow
which
directly
represents
data
coming
from
the
senses
and
top-down
modulatory
influences
which
encode
expectations
of
the
interpretation
of
incoming
sensory
data
in
the
context
of
current
knowledge
in
dream-like
states
and
during
normal
task-based
visualization
the
sensory
input
is
cut
off
by
the
thalamus
and
the
brain
iterates
on
top-down
information
during
psychedelic
states
it
also
seems
that
the
top-down
signals
become
highly
influential
and
support
radical
interpretations
of
the
senses
which
are
then
passed
back
up
in
a
resonant
loop
of
evolving
perceptions
during
this
resonant
process
latent
perceptual
patterns
which
are
already
encoded
in
the
neuronal
connection
weights
are
allowed
to
be
amplified
and
represented
in
the
visual
field
in
a
self-consistent
manner
but
with
little
regard
to
the
normal
interpretation
of
sensory
inputs<br/><br/>recently
google
has
demonstrated
this
type
of
behavior
in
an
artificial
neural
network
based
on
deep
learning
from
natural
image
sets
this
inception
network
is
allowed
to
evolve
so
that
it
amplifies
those
internal
representations
which
are
already
part
of
its
response
to
a
source
image
when
rendered
back
into
the
image
domain
the
network
hallucinates
self-consistent
structures
based
on
information
that
it
has
learned
through
its
training
cycles
extremely
bizarre
fractal
artwork
is
generated
by
this
process
which
is
very
similar
to
the
psychedelic
experience<br/><br/>as
mentioned
already
the
brain
starts
by
analyzing
local
features
of
the
scene
such
as
edges
and
their
orientations
and
proceeds
to
abstract
more
and
more
complex
representations
neurons
have
been
discovered
that
respond
preferentially
to
hands
and
faces
or
to
the
actions
of
other
people
such
as
picking
up
food
in
every
sensory
system
more
abstract
concepts
of
perception
are
progressively
computed
from
simpler
concepts
through
a
succession
of
neural
layers
one
of
the
dose
dependent
features
of
psychedelics
is
that
they
start
by
producing
simple
and
rather
local
distortions
to
perception
for
example
enhancing
colors
or
introducing
wavy
motions
and
then
as
dose
increases
they
create
more
complex
holistic
hallucinations
such
as
visualizing
strange
or
beautiful
places
or
seeing
bizarre
animals
in
the
patterns
of
light
among
trees
it
seems
like
each
increment
of
dose
is
associated
with
the
spread
of
psychedelic
effects
further
up
the
hierarchy
of
neural
processing
layers
producing
distortions
of
perception
at
increasing
levels
of
conceptual
abstraction<br/><br/>it
is
important
to
understand
that
neurons
carry
out
spatiotemporal
processing
meaning
that
they
analyze
in
time
as
well
as
in
space
color
audio
components
touch
etc
we
have
the
ability
to
think
about
and
represent
time\x97related
concepts
such
as
the
sequencing
of
events
neuroscience
research
has
tended
to
focus
on
rather
simple
temporal
concepts
for
example
the
analysis
of
local
motion
from
the
visual
scene
or
examining
how
animals
track
their
bodys
motion
through
the
environment
however
it
is
highly
likely
that
the
brain
computes
extremely
abstract
spatiotemporal
representations
of
what
is
happening
in
the
world
that
allow
us
to
visualize
the
temporal
components
of
first
or
third\x97person
story
narratives<br/><br/>for
example
we
are
able
to
conceptualize
walking
down
a
garden
path
into
a
wide
open
field
it
is
the
stuff
of
fictional
writing
what
is
happening
to
you
or
other
people
as
a
function
of
time
the
meaning
and
temporal
sequencing
of
interpersonal
interactions
and
the
evolving
motivations
of
others
we
can
perceive
these
narratives
talk
about
them
and
reason
about
them
and
so
we
must
have
neurons
which
function
as
the
building
blocks
of
such
complex
temporal
structures
too
i
think
of
this
is
a
learned
perceptual
representation
of
chunks
of
strong
statistical
correlations
in
the
world
and
not
necessarily
the
same
as
making
an
episodic
memory
of
a
single
first\x97person
life
experience<br/><br/>the
point
of
this
argument
is
that
psychedelics
can
progressively
interfere
with
spatiotemporal
perceptions
in
a
dose\x97dependent
manner
leading
to
more
and
more
abstract
conceptual
hallucinations
including
generating
fully\x97formed
interpersonal
narratives
and
this
may
help
to
explain
the
frequent
entity
encounters
and
personal
dream\x97like
stories
that
people
can
experience
for
example
using
dmt
on
one
occasion
for
a
number
of
seconds
i
was
on
a
roller\x97coaster
going
over
a
hump
and
down
into
a
complex
golden
valley
and
a
woman
with
long
flowing
hair
on
the
car
in
front
was
turning
to
look
back
at
me
it
was
a
mystical
experience
that
was
made
up
of
a
spontaneously
generated
and
evolving
abstract
story
line<br/><br/>as
a
final
point
about
the
neurophysiology
of
the
psychedelic
experience
i
would
also
mention
the
role
of
attention
a
person
is
always
shifting
the
focus
of
their
attention
from
moment
to
moment
and
this
works
like
a
selector
bringing
into
focus
the
most
appropriate
information
to
process
next
with
the
limited
resources
that
we
have
available
the
neuroscience
of
attention
is
a
complex
subject
but
one
thing
is
worth
mentioning
attending
to
any
perception
subtly
changes
the
neural
processing
applied
to
that
information
enhancing
and
altering
it
relative
to
its
competing
neighbors
it
is
not
surprising
then
that
attention
plays
a
strong
role
in
the
psychedelic
experience
where
choosing
to
attend
or
not
attend
to
a
thing
can
strongly
effect
the
evolution
of
the
experience
attending
to
psychedelic
patterns
disrupts
or
changes
the
sensation
leading
to
other
patterns
as
a
result
hallucinations
are
like
quick
little
slippery
fishes
that
you
can
never
quite
catch
to
study
in
detail<br/><br/>it
is
commonly
stated
as
fact
that
the
pineal
gland
of
the
brain
synthesizes
dmt
and
this
has
some
effect
on
consciousness
this
idea
is
really
an
internet
meme
which
has
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
with
almost
no
supporting
evidence
the
idea
that
dmt
has
a
natural
role
in
the
brain
arose
out
of
conjectures
at
various
times
by
andrew
weil
and
rick
strassman
and
has
been
repeated
again
and
again
in
popular
writing
and
conversation
as
though
it
was
scientifically
established
while
it
is
true
that
one
study
co-authored
with
rick
strassman
found
unspecified
amounts
of
dmt
in
the
rat
pineal
gland
barker
et
al
2013
in
my
opinion
the
lack
of
a
logical
role
for
dmt
in
the
body
and
very
weak
evidence
of
pineal
gland
involvement
leads
these
ideas
to
have
a
limited
appeal
the
pineal
gland
itself
while
historically
viewed
as
the
seat
of
the
soul
is
a
tiny
gland
which
is
structurally
simple
and
is
scientifically
established
to
be
involved
in
circadian
rhythm
based
synthesis
of
melatonin
surgical
removal
of
the
pineal
gland
in
rodents
does
not
affect
normal
cognitive
processing
so
i
suspect
a
concrete
pineal-dmt-consciousness
connection
has
limited
merit<br/><br/>a
deeply
complex
issue
is
the
extent
to
which
the
dmt
experience
can
be
considered
real
certainly
dmt
produces
a
fairly
convincing
perceptual
journey
to
other
realities
as
does
ketamine
but
the
big
question
is
whether
these
states
are
fabricated
in
the
mind
or
have
any
objective
reality
the
compelling
similarity
of
entity
encounters
and
psychedelic
experiences
between
individuals
provides
some
support
for
the
objectivity
of
dmt
reality
states
however
humans
also
share
the
same
brain
architecture
and
experiential
frameworks
and
this
fact
could
explain
the
propensity
for
similar
states
during
psychedelic
intoxication
similar
brain
circuits
are
activated
even
though
the
details
might
differ
there
is
also
the
tendency
for
narratives
to
converge
as
people
discuss
their
experiences
even
though
these
narratives
might
have
initially
been
quite
different
social
and
cultural
frameworks
provide
a
powerful
regularizer
on
the
interpretation
of
experiences<br/><br/>in
popular
writing
there
has
been
a
strong
tendency
to
jump
from
the
dmt
experience
as
proof
of
other
realities
to
theories
of
quantum
consciousness
or
other
esoteric
mechanisms
by
which
the
brain
may
communicate
using
out-there
or
imaginary
physics
with
other
realms
these
are
all
discussed
as
though
they
are
proven
fact
and
the
complete
lack
of
any
supporting
evidence
or
rational
mechanisms
is
further
encouragement
for
the
authors
to
speculate
ever
more
wildly
strassman
et
al
2008<br/><br/>in
my
opinion
the
structure
of
the
brain
and
the
users
social
setting
and
belief
system
can
explain
the
experiences
that
people
report
if
you
have
ever
tried
an
oculus
rift
virtual
reality
system
you
will
know
that
surrounding
a
person
with
complete
sensory
signals
of
a
place
produces
a
compelling
feeling
of
virtual
embodiment
both
ketamine
and
dmt
can
produce
states
where
the
whole
sensory
system
is
recruited
by
overwhelming
experiences
of
internally
generated
environments
and
this
produces
a
feeling
of
certainty
in
the
reality
of
those
places
the
weirdness
of
dmt
trips
is
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
resonant
modes
of
neural
feedback
are
not
normally
experienced
and
so
have
unfamiliar
properties
which
seem
artificial
and
alien
to
the
voyager
in
addition
there
have
been
studies
which
show
that
people
can
have
entity
encounter
hallucinations
while
sober
if
their
temporal
lobes
are
magnetically
stimulated
booth
et
al
2005
although
these
studies
have
been
questioned
grangvist
et
al
2005
suggesting
that
activity
in
certain
brain
areas
is
correlated
with
mystical
encounters<br/><br/>clearly
much
of
the
brain
is
involved
in
the
processing
of
social
interactions
and
representing
other
versus
self
and
so
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
ghost-like
or
alien-like
presences
can
be
experienced
during
psychedelic
states
in
a
recent
experiment
subjects
guided
a
robot
to
touch
their
own
back
using
a
remote
control
blanke
et
al
2014
when
a
few
milliseconds
of
delay
was
inserted
in
the
system
so
that
their
actions
were
no
longer
quite
immediate
they
began
to
experience
the
touches
as
being
caused
by
a
scary
apparition
present
in
the
room
even
though
they
were
alone
this
demonstrates
how
easy
it
is
for
us
to
perceive
aspects
of
our
experience
to
be
caused
by
external
beings
another
well
understood
example
is
the
state
of
sleep
paralysis
where
people
wake
up
in
a
semi-paralyzed
state
due
to
common
neurological
disturbances
and
experience
this
as
though
a
malevolent
being
is
persecuting
them
the
resulting
complex
narratives
include
demonic
attacks
or
alien
encounters<br/><br/>in
summary
i
think
that
because
the
brain
is
so
complex
we
underestimate
the
breadth
of
experiences
that
can
be
spontaneously
generated
when
its
function
is
slightly
perturbed
and
we
quickly
jump
to
mystical
explanations
as
the
main
cause
having
said
that
science
has
nothing
to
say
about
the
subjectivity
of
personal
experience
and
each
person
exists
in
their
own
universe
of

my
background
fascinated
with
tryptamines
dreams
and
the
exploration
of
my
mind
the
last
two
from
a
young
age
experienced
with
many
different
psychedelics

prelude

the
following
write-up
is
a
collection
of
most
of
the
dmt
experiences
i
have
had
over
the
past
two
years
i
went
through
a
time
period
where
i
was
using
dmt
fairly
often
because
i
was
so
interested
in
the
unique
experiences
it
offered
as
a
psychedelic
and
i
have
realized
now
that
its
best
to
not
use
it
as
frequently
i
base
this
on
the
fact
that
i
now
have
a
higher
tolerance
than
i
used
to
and
breaking
through
at
some
points
became
very
hit
or
miss
sometimes
even
when
i
took
hit
after
hit
its
almost
as
if
i
only
broke
through
at
certain
times
that
were
right
regardless
of
how
high
or
low
the
dose
my
dosage
at
the
beginning
started
around
20mg
and
later
on
i
started
using
more
like
40mg
and
50mg
a
few
times
but
unfortunately
i
didnt
record
the
dosage
for
each
specific
trip
i
dont
regret
anything
as
this
has
all
been
a
learning
process
and
now
i
have
a
wealth
of
interesting
experiences
to
share
here
-
it
is
going
to
be
a
delight
to
write
this
up
i
am
remembering
all
of
these
experiences
based
on
notes
in
my
dmt
journal
this
is
going
to
be
long
but
feel
free
to
just
read
a
few
if
you
dont
have
the
time
for
all
of
it

background
info

it
is
quite
a
story
some
of
these
experiences
have
seemed
to
be
continuations
of
previous
experiences
and
there
are
also
certain
entities
that
i
have
encountered
multiple
times
i
must
explain
that
the
way
i
look
at
entity
contact
on
dmt
is
that
these
entities
may
exist
separately
from
us
or
they
may
exist
solely
within
us
in
this
case
it
would
be
useful
to
interpret
these
experiences
in
the
same
way
we
would
dreams
i
also
think
its
possible
that
these
entities
may
be
part
of
ourselves
and
separate
at
the
same
time
for
example
maybe
they
operate
from
microconsciousnesses
that
inhabit
and
make
up
our
larger
springboard
consciousness
that
we
operate
from
and
perhaps
dmt
provides
us
access
to
this
type
of
interaction
or
communication
i
suppose
my
point
is
that
in
regards
to
these
otherworldly
perceptions
i
dont
believe
anything
for
sure
and
i
keep
an
open
mind
to
all
of
the
options
when
describing
my
experiences
i
will
likely
refer
to
these
entities
as
if
they
are
actual
beings
that
are
separate
from
us
as
that
is
the
way
it
has
often
felt
for
me
when
in
hyperspace


i
hope
that
these
experiences
give
the
reader
an
idea
of
how
diverse
dmt
experiences
can
be
for
one
single
person
my
experiences
have
ranged
from
spiritually
glowing
to
mind-boggling
to
disgusting
and
terrifying
and
entities
i
have
met
have
had
many
different
qualities
-
some
have
been
helpful
and
affirming
of
all
that
i
value
in
life
and
others
seemed
to
intend
to
use
me
for
their
own
purposes
or
trick
me
even
throughout
the
difficult
times
i
have
remained
fascinated
by
this
compound
and
eager
to
learn
all
the
way
and
still
am
to
this
day

***

the
first
time
i
really
got
a
strong
effect
on
dmt
i
still
felt
ties
to
my
ego
and
environment
i
encountered
three
alien-like
beings
that
were
tall
and
slender
they
werent
very
detailed
they
were
seen
mainly
as
silhouettes
one
of
them
came
up
to
me
with
a
round
seed-like
object
in
his
hands
and
presented
it
to
me
it
had
a
glowing
pinpoint
of
light
and
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
get
me
interested
in
the
object
during
this
experience
i
was
on
the
phone
with
my
partner
d
and
he
was
doing
5-meo-dmt
on
the
other
end
i
think
that
ds
experience
mustve
not
been
as
encompassing
as
mine
because
during
my
experience
i
heard
him
saying
my
name
on
the
phone
and
this
confused
me
a
bit
i
told
him
dont
call
me
that
when
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
phone
to
tell
him
this
the
entity
that
was
offering
me
the
object
seemed
to
back
off
as
if
he
understood
oh
youre
busy
right
now
ill
come
back
another
time
i
remember
being
a
little
disappointed
as
he
dissipated
right
after
this
and
i
began
to
come
down
so
yeah
it
was
actually
a
pretty
typical
experience
for
dmt
and
it
is
worth
noting
that
at
this
point
i
purposely
hadnt
listened
to
terence
mckenna
or
many
others
describing
their
dmt
experiences
because
i
had
heard
that
so
many
people
experience
similar
concepts
and
entities

i
wanted
to
see
if
without
expectations
the
same
sorts
of
things
would
happen
for
me
after
this
first
experience
i
started
reading
all
about
the
similarities
across
dmt
experiences
of
various
individuals
i
found
out
that
it
wasnt
uncommon
for
people
to
have
objects
bestowed
upon
them
by
entities
i
was
simply
amazed
that
my
experience
had
been
a
textbook
dmt
experience
regardless
of
the
fact
that
i
hadnt
had
any
expectations
because
i
hadnt
read
much
about
the
specifics
of
others
experience

***

after
this
intrigued
i
had
a
couple
more
experiences
that
week
one
of
them
was
pretty
much
just
colorful
eye
candy
and
no
banter
with
entities
-
it
just
consisted
of
orange
and
lime
beings
in
hula
skirts
dancing
buddha-like
beings
and
sentiments
of
my
dream
the
night
before
another
time
i
felt
lonely
and
wanted
to
communicate
with
somebody
but
instead
i
found
myself
in
a
barren
space
that
seemed
to
be
deep
underground
this
space
consisted
only
of
machines
and
devices
they
reminded
me
of
cameras
a
little
bit
as
they
seemed
invasive
in
some
sense
and
pointed
towards
me
this
whole
dark-ish
experience
seemed
very
vague
and
there
was
not
much
color
for
the
rest
of
these
experiences
i
will
just
write
about
what
i
encountered
in
each
visit
to
hyperspace
separated
by
stars
and
not
so
much
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
dmt
was
had
unless
important

***

there
were
beings
all
around
me
they
were
surrounding
me
and
had
objects
that
seemed
pointy
container-like
and
made
of
glass
these
beings
seemed
reptilian
-
how
cliche
they
proceeded
to
put
a
viscous
liquid
into
pointy
glass
containers
and
then
put
these
containers
in
the
dirt
where
they
burrowed
into
the
ground
i
felt
that
the
entities
were
trying
to
tell
me
something
about
the
state
of
the
earth
at
the
end
they
dispersed
except
for
one
being
i

think
that
he
was
male
and
very
young
or
small
he
seemed
lonely
but
i
got
the
impression
that
he
was
acting
or
not
being
completely
honest
he
told
me
to
please
not
leave
that
realm
i
communicated
back
that
i
enjoyed
it
there
and
that
i
also
wished
sometimes
that
i
could
stay
and
told
him
that
he
probably
somehow
knew
that
better
than
i
did

***

i
was
sitting
at
a
desk
with
a
bunch
of
colleagues
they
seemed
human

this
experience
definitely
had
a
business-like
vibe
to
it
i
felt
accepted
and
happy
and
like
i
enjoyed
my
job
this
trip
was
actually
rather
uneventful
but
the
interesting
thing
is
that
i
sort
of
had
a
feeling
like
i
was
looking
into
my
future
this
feeling
was
strange
in
itself
because
it
felt
like
a
premonition

***

i
felt
like
i
was
being
tested
and
had
more
reptilian
feelings
i
felt
pretty
uncomfortable
and
was
still
in
contact
with
this
reality
a
little
bit
my
mind
justified
my
feelings
of
discomfort
such
as
my
partner
d
was
playing
some
sort
of
first
person
shooter
video
game
in
the
other
room
and
i
could
hear
disturbing
noises
from
the
game
in
the
background
this
justification
was
probably
an
auto-defense
mechanism
i
encountered
entities
again
and
got
the
feeling
that
the
general
consensus
about
me
in
the
space
was
that
even
if
a
dark
or
evil
spirit
encountered
me
i
was
so
naive
that
i
would
probably
find
the
good
within
it
this
could
be
good
as
well
as
bad
bad
as
in
i
could
be
taken
advantage
of
or
used
as
some
sort
of
host
but
the
good
thing
was
that
i
could
make
the
situation
good
and
change
things
just
from
my
perception
alone
they
seemed
like
they
were
evaluating
me
on
something
uneasy

***

this
was
quite
delightful
i
was
in
a
different
place
entirely
and
it
was
very
very
colorful
this
is
the
only
experience
i
can
think
of
where
i
saw
elf-like
creatures
though
i
didnt
think
of
this
way
when
i
was
there
i
was
in
a
multi-dimensional
place
that
unfolded
in
all
directions
and
on
all
sides
i
couldnt
tell
where
the
ceiling
floor
or
walls
began
there
were
boxes
on
every
wall
lined
up
everywhere
and
each
box
had
a
small
wooden
looking
creature
inside
each
creature
had
a
sort
of
pointed
hat
and
interchangeable
body
parts
that
could
be
switched
with
the
parts
of
others
they
were
all
identical
in
shape
and
form
but
had
different
colored
and
textured
parts
souls
or
energies
could
also
transfer
from
one
being
to
another
i
could
become
part
of
them
and
they
could
become
part
of
me
there
was
a
constant
existential
narrative
most
of
which
i
cant
remember
but
it
was
about
what
existence
was
and
what
the
purpose
was
of
this
space
and
its
role
in
existence
i
remember
that
the
narrative
assured
me
that
i
could
come
back
anytime
i
wanted
there
were
so
many
amazing
details
that
i
wish
i
could
remember
of
this
place
at
the
time
i
remember
knowing
that
it
was
so
intricate
and
out
of
this
world
that
i
wasnt
sure
if
id
be
able
to
possibly
remember
everything
at
the
time
which
kind
of
devastated
me
because
i
wanted
so
desperately
to
be
able
to
bring
it
back
i
still
took
in
everything
that
i
could
and
it
was
so
beautiful

***

i
felt
like
wait
isnt
there
something
im
supposed
to
be
finding
out
inquiring
about
and
as
soon
as
i
asked
everything
exploded
in
my
face
everyone
rushed
forth
urgently
giving
me
a
message
war
gears
turned
imagery
of
guns
bombs
war
symbols
cannons
tanks
and
strange
masked
people
flooded
my
field
of
vision
and
emotion
it
was
overwhelming
to
say
the
least
there
was
a
warning
this
is
imminent
this
is
serious
information
was
disclosed
unto
me
about
the
state
of
the
world
the
feeling
became
more
and
more
abstract
as
well
as
terrifying
and
alarming
then
suddenly
i
felt
a
feeling
of
loss
unlike
anything
id
ever
experienced
ive
never
had
anybody
really
close
to
me
die
in
my
life
but
i
felt
like
this
right
now
it
felt
so
wrong
like
something
had
been
prematurely
snatched
away
from
me
from
life
it
felt
so
dirty
and
even
slightly
evil
but
that
sounds
stupid
profound
sadness
and
grief
the
resolution
was
this
really
could
happen
but
there
was
good
news
too-
i
had
love
and
i
needed
to
appreciate
what
i
had
because
who
ever
knew
what
could
happen
at
the
end
of
that
experience
some
sort
of
trickster-ish
entity
said
something
to
me
like
wait
two
months
before
visiting
us
again
ha
okay
two
weeks
is
fine
we
really
*do*
want
you
here
dont
feel
bad
so
bizarre

***

i
had
a
very
special
trip
with
d
and
my
friend
n
i
could
tell
right
away
that
this
was
going
to
be
more
intense
than
anything
i
had
experienced
on
dmt
up
until
that
point
i
slipped
into
a
place
where
i
lost
complete
contact
with
the
waking
reality
as
i
knew
it
and
did
not
remember
my
surroundings
or
who
i
was
at
all
yet
i
must
have
still
remembered
my
life
somehow
and
you
will
soon
hear
why
i
returned
to
a
place
that
seemed
very
familiar
everything
that
had
ever
happened
to
me
was
happening
at
once
i
felt
a
presence
of
sorts
but
no
communication
at
least
not
a
banter
at
the
beginning
i
felt
terrified
but
i
somehow
loved
it
at
the
same
time
because
it
was
just
so
overwhelming
and
right
i
felt
scrutinized
and
i
knew
i
had
to
give
up
everything
and
all
control
in
order
to
be
alright
so
i
surrendered
as
quickly
as
i
could
im
glad
i
did
otherwise
it
would
have
probably
been
unbearable
i
thought
that
i
was
in
other
places
entirely
i
felt
specific
era
feelings
of
different
time
periods
of
my
life
they
were
so
real
and
had
synesthetic
qualities
i
felt
myself
living
in
all
of
the
places
id
ever
lived
in
before
yet
i
still
somehow
was
not
in
touch
with
my
ego
it
felt
like
a
familiar
dream
space
it
was
like
i
was
reliving
every
moment
of
my
entire
life
at
once
and
this
one
moment
was
eternal
i
saw
bright
colors
that
were
arranged
sort
of
like
a
western
blot
but
they
were
glowing
and
shifting
and
more
colorful
it
was
like
a
code
it
would
change
abruptly
like
it
was
being
operated
by
a
light
switch
that
had
a
lot
of
different
settings
i
remember
one
time
the
code
turned
black
and
white
which
alarmed
me
somehow
for
a
second
as
i
came
down
i
remembered
my
life
again
and
realized
that
i
was
in
ns
bedroom
and
had
just
had
some
dmt
and
i
just
felt
nothing
but
pure
bliss
i
kept
laughing
at
the
sheer
ridiculousness
that
is
life
and
existence
and
was
so
wowed
by
the
whole
experience

***

on
the
porch
outside
the
atmosphere
was
inspirational
this
trip
was
kind
of
similar
to
the
one
i
had
at
ns
house
in
the
way
that
i
transcended
my
tethers
to
this
reality
in
a
similar
way
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
i
felt
like
i
was
splashed
with
water
or
had
water
poured
all
over
me
drenched
and
the
feeling
was
so
vivid
i
also
felt
like
there
was
something
in
my
throat
i
later
found
out
on
dmt-nexus
that
this
sensation
is
called
the
dmt
throat
marble
i
went
through
a
sort
of
path
perhaps
a
fabric
maze
though
i
was
sensing
where
i
was
rather
than
visually
seeing
it
i
was
washed
in
deja
vu
as
i
remembered
this
exact
path
or
process
as
something
i
had
gone
through
before
maybe
even
numerous
times
it
didnt
feel
as
if
it
had
happened
in
a
dream
or
psychedelic
experience
but
its
possible
it
had
not
sure
i
knew
that
i
would
never
remember
all
the
details
as
it
was
so
complex
there
were
things
going
on
and
projects
happening
everywhere
all
around
me
and
i
was
a
part
of
it
every
actual
movement
i
made
caused
the
colors
and
scene
to
change
if
i
put
my
physical
hands
out
with
my
eyes
closed
i
could
see
the
resonance
it
created
in
the
realm
i
could
feel
the
physical
qualities
of
things
synesthetically
when
i
came
down
i
watched
reality
reassemble
everything
for
a
bit
was
wispy
and
stringlike
blowing
in
the
wind
as
if
the
fabric
of
reality
had
been
reduced
to
mere
strings
it
was
really
amazing
to
watch
and
the
comedown
was
kind
of
overwhelming

***

this
next
one
was
a
vague
conceptual
non-colorful
experience
i
saw
human
forms
wearing
black
business
suits
sunglasses
and
hats
i
got
the
feeling
that
they
were
doing
something
covert
i
experienced
a
sort
of
video
collage
of
them
doing
all
sorts
of
sped-up
business
transactions
shaking
hands
driving
places
to
get
and
deliver
products
selling
things
etc
at
the
very
end
i
saw
one
of
the
businessmen
return
home
to
his
family
wife
and
children
and
not
pay
very
much
attention
to
them
apparently
he
cared
more
about
his
job
than
his
family

***

i
had
an
experience
where
i
felt
like
i
was
going
through
some
sort
of
obstacle
course
i
met
other
*human*
spirits
not
sure
how
i
could
tell
or
what
made
them
seem
human
to
me
but
that
is
what
i
perceived
we
all
had
to
help
one
another
to
get
through
the
course
at
the
end
i
felt
immense
gratitude
and
it
seemed
like
all
of
the
human
spirits
were
thanking
one
another
for
their
help


***

this
time
i
did
the
dmt
on
top
of
lsd
and
4-aco-dipt
i
did
the
dmt
twice
during
this
session
you
can
find
the
entire
experience
report
under
my
name
here
http//wwwerowidorg/experiences/expphpid=99864

the
first
experience
my
friend
and
i
were
confronted
we
both
felt
this
by
some
sort
of
strange
angry
presence
of
an
entity
that
seemed
to
inhabit
the
room
we
were
in
we
talked
about
it
on
the
way
down
and
had
experienced
the
exact
same
thing
shed
had
a
lot
of
strange
dmt
experiences
in
this
room
already
actually
to
me
the
spirit
was
angrily
asking
me
why
do
all
you
humans
ignore
us
were
all
around
you
all
the
time
causing
so
much
to
happen
yet
you
credit
yourselves
for
everything
i
tried
to
communicate
to
the
spirit
that
i
liked
sharing
reality
with
them
and
that
i
felt
that
there
was
a
lot
of
resonance
from
forces
that
we
could
not
observe
acting
upon
everything
all
the
time
i
tried
to
console
the
anger
of
this
entity
my
friend
and
i
both
felt
more
calm
and
less
of
an
angry
presence
around
the
same
point
in
the
trip
after
this

the
next
experience
that
night
as
i
tried
to
light
the
third
hit
of
dmt
my
spatial
sense
was
so
off
that
it
took
a
lot
of
effort
to
figure
out
where
to
hold
the
lighter
it
didnt
help
my
efforts
that
my
eyes
were
darting
around
as
if
i
were
in
rem
sleep
mode
i
looked
around
the
room
as
i
managed
to
take
2
more
hits
and
noticed
that
the
room
had
turned
into
some
sort
of
candy
factory-like
territory
every
piece
of
furniture
and
object
in
the
room
was
static
intact
and
took
on
the
exact
same
shape
and
form
as
it
normally
would
but
each
thing
had
its
own
special
pattern
that
did
not
overlap
with
the
patterns
of
other
objects
for
instance
my
friends
walls
which
were
usually
just
plain
white
were
wallpapered
in
lime
green
and
pink
stripes
the
plain
wooden
dresser
was
bright
blue
with
bright
pink
flowers
and
teddy
bears
i
think
that
another
piece
of
furniture
had
painted
colorful
candy
canes
on
it
i
was
simply
amazed
that
everything
in
the
room
could
look
exactly
the
same
and
be
static
unmoving
yet
literally
looked
like
it
was
painted
and
wallpapered
completely
differently
it
was
so
realistic
and
seemed
like
a
dimension
warp
or
something
after
i
closed
my
eyes
needless
to
say
things
became
even
more
interesting

the
place
i
was
taken
to
also
reminded
me
of
a
candy
factory
or
playroom
themes
from
childhood
were
constantly
present
there
was
a
rotating
gear
a
sort
of
mandala
that
dominated
my
vision
in
the
center
of
a
colorful
tasty
room
the
gears/sections
of
the
mandala
were
rhythmically
changing
and
transforming
systematically
like
the
second
hand
of
a
clock
every
second
or
so
or
however
much
time
that
really
was
a
section
of
it
would
develop
into
something
else
and
so
on
everything
i
saw
from
that
point
on
was
so
incredibly
detailed
and
rhythmic
i
felt
like
i
was
a
little
kid
in
an
interactive
virtual
reality
candy
shop
this
space
was
very
synesthetic
and
even
tasted
like
candy

***

one
time
i
found
myself
in
some
sort
of
barn
i
felt
like
i
was
drowning
in
a
pile
of
hay
or
something
and
i
felt
the
presence
of
a
horse-like
entity
my
visions
corresponded
appropriately
in
some
sort
of
abstract
way
at
the
time
i
was
kind
of
turned
off
by
the
experience
because
i
honestly
didnt
really
want
to
be
there
in
a
pile
of
hay
something
about
the
experience
felt
cheesy
to
me
as
i
was
coming
down
i
realized
that
the
reason
id
had
this
experience
was
because
i
had
some
things
to
do
for
work
but
id
had
a
lot
of
other
things
to
tend
to
as
well
and
had
been
putting
off
calling
my
boss
who
reminded
me
and
my
boyfriend
of
a
horse
and
i
have
mentioned
to
several
other
people
that
he
seems
horselike
and
most
people
have
seemed
to
agree
i
found
the
symbolism
to
be
interesting
and
very
reminiscent
of
dreams
latent
and
manifest
content

***

had
some
dmt
on
top
of
ketamine
this
was
*extremely*
visual
and
incredibly
synergistic
it
seemed
i
noticed
that
the
sheets
on
my
bed
switched
patterns
with
one
another
one
had
flowers
and
one
was
a
solid
blue
color
and
arranged
themselves
by
color
into
a
pinwheel
with
a
big
black
hole
in
the
middle
i
felt
like
all
the
energy
in
the
room
was
accordingly
being
sucked
into
the
black
hole
and
i
felt
like
i
was
going
in
too
i
think
i
may
have
been
sucked
in
because
suddenly
things
became
black
and
void-like
but
then
when
i
emerged
elsewhere
i
felt
a
sense
of
grandiose
importance
emerge
in
my
mind
i
encountered
an
entity
who
seemed
to
have
some
sort
of
high
status
business-wise
he
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
take
on
a
very
important
job
position
in
hyperspace
since
i
was
apparently
fit
for
the
position
i
felt
so
bewildered
and
astonished
at
the
time
as
if
i
was
thinking
youd
*really*
choose
*me*

i
felt
like
the
position
was
something
very
serious
and
important
and
i
didnt
think
it
should
be
taken
lightly
i
psychically
communicated
to
the
entity
that
i
needed
a
bit
of
time
to
think
as
it
seemed
like
an
important
position
of
leadership
as
the
entity
had
implied
i
thought
about
it
for
what
seemed
like
a
while
but
was
probably
not
actually
very
long
and
i
decided
to
respect
the
offer/position
and
take
it
i
communicated
this
to
the
entity
but
then
the
experience
dissipated

***

next
experience
was
very
much
a
continuation
of
the
last
one
this
time
i
had
dmt
on
top
of
4-ho-mipt
this
was
a
very
strong
experience
as
i
completely
lost
touch
with
reality
and
upon
coming
back
was
like
wow
im
in
*this*
life
i
remember
this
one
of
those
experiences
anyway
my
understanding
is
that
i
met
the
boss
entity
he
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
ceo
in
hyperspace
ridiculous
to
think
about
but
that
is
how
it
seemed
he
seemed
all-knowing
and
completely
ancient
he
appeared
to
be
made
out
of
antique
wood
and
was
covered
in
various
compartments
such
as
drawers
doors
and
windows
during
this
experience
i
felt
very
honored
to
meet
this
entity
it
seemed
like
he
imparted
some
serious
knowledge
unto
me
about
intent
manifestation
in
the
waking
life
through
dream
and
trance
states

***

had
some
dmt
on
top
of
mxe
this
experience
was
*quite*
bewildering
i
instantly
felt
like
i
was
punched
in
the
face
with
confusion
and
encountered
an
entity
before
i
knew
it
collided
into
the
entity
in
fact
this
entity
was
super
pointy
and
accordingly
seemed
to
have
spikes
encountering
it
actually
caused
me
physical
pain
in
some
way
it
was
orange
and/or
yellow
and
black
it
reminded
me
of
the
electric
legendary
bird
in
pokemon
zapdos
zap-dose
ha
i
felt
like
i
was
either
zapped
or
stuck
by
a
porcupine
or
a
mixture
of
both
stunned
is
the
best
word
to
describe
the
way
i
felt
at
the
time

***

this
next
experience
i
was
still
pretty
grounded
in
reality
as
in
i
didnt
lose
contact
with
my
ego
and
still
knew
where
i
was
but
i
still
experienced
entity
contact
i
saw
orange
forms
and
felt
a
feminine
presence
i
felt
a
tremendous
healing
power
from
this
presence
and
felt
like
i
was
being
taken
care
of
i
hadnt
been
feeling
top-notch
the
past
couple
of
days
the
female
entities
were
very
warm
and
didnt
seem
like
they
wanted
anything
other
than
to
help
me
the
most
warmth
ive
ever
felt
from
dmt
entities
they
fed
me
food
it
was
long
and
when
looking
back
it
reminded
me
of
intestines
in
its
shape
but
not
gross
or
anything
i
felt
happy
and
cared
for
and
it
seemed
that
the
food
was
meant
to
improve
my
health

***

3
big
hits
i
dont
know
where
i
was
but
i
was
confronted
by
a
mother
entity
she
was
shapeless
dripping
melting
ugly
terrifying
disgusting
and
even
smelled
bad
i
wasnt
sure
what
was
going
on
but
next
thing
i
knew
she
was
engaging
me
in
psychic
conversation
she
had
a
wallet
of
some
sort
and
began
showing
me
photographs
of
her
son
i
could
tell
that
she
loved
her
son
very
much
she
also
had
a
bunch
of
his
artwork
that
she
was
obviously
proud
of
and
began
showing
it
to
me
the
problem
was
her
son
and
all
of
his
artwork
were
also
melting
grotesque
and
disgusting
i
could
still
feel
her
genuine
love
for
her
son
and
pride
in
his
artwork
but
at
the
same
time
no
matter
how
hard
i
tried
to
show
her
love
i
couldnt
hide
the
fact
that
i
felt
grossed
out
by
her
and
the
entire
situation
i
could
tell
that
she
could
tell
that
i
was
feeling
uncomfortable

when
i
came
down
from
this
trip
i
found
myself
feeling
guilty
for
not
being
able
to
feel/give
the
love
that
i
felt
that
i
should
have
given
her
so
i
had
another
hit
of
dmt
and
tried
to
meditate
on
the
experience
and
its
meaning
i
tried
to
send
out
my
purest
most
intended
form
of
love
to
her
and
every
other
entity
under
this
umbrella
called
consciousness
i
even
tried
to
psychically
apologize
to
her
for
my
reaction
to
her
i
felt
a
little
bit
better
after
that
like
i
had
resolved
something

***

in
the
winter
one
year
i
made
a
habit
of
doing
dmt
in
the
shower
sounds
weird
i
know
but
i
was
doing
low
doses
mainly
because
i
didnt
want
to
lose
complete
contact
with
reality
this
shower
had
beautiful
tiles
and
strange
walls
with
many
faces
in
the
patterns
that
appeared
to
be
trapped
spirits
in
rapture
that
is
the
way
i
saw
them
most
of
the
time
anyway
i
knew
that
itd
be
a
beautiful
place
for
the
trips
and
i
was
right
seeing
the
water
on
the
tiles
reminded
me
of
a
whimsical
dream
id
had
back
in
2004
where
i
was
in
paradise
in
the
dream
i
had
been
in
a
tiled
cave
with
pools
of
all
different
depths
planks
up
in
the
air
with
flowing
streams
inside
bridges
with
streams
waterfalls
and
flies
no
matter
where
you
dropped
down
or
jumped
into
the
water
it
was
okay
because
you
would
ultimately
fall
into
deeper
pool
at
the
bottom
seeing
the
water
on
the
tiles
almost
instantly
made
me
relive
that
dream
which
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
dreams
of
all
time
a
divine
moment
of
truth
in
a
tiled
cave
with
waterfalls
all
around
not
entirely
breakthrough
but
beautiful
nonetheless

***

one
time
i
got
tricked
pretty
hardcore
when
doing
dmt
i
thought
id
put
a
pretty
large
amount
in
the
pipe
but
i
must
have
gotten
it
all
in
the
first
big
hit
the
pipe
at
this
point
after
this
hit
meant
something
else
to
me
entirely-
it
wasnt
a
pipe
or
a
lighter
i
felt
like
it
was
very
important
for
me
to
keep
hitting
the
pipe
over
and
over
again
like
it
was
a
special
mission
of
mine
i
dont
even
know
what
i
was
trying
to
accomplish
at
the
time

suddenly
it
dawned
on
me
that
id
been
tricked
and
had
spent
the
whole
trip
confused
trying
to
get
more
dmt
i
felt
very
stupid
and
saw
it
as
a
metaphor
to
stop
being
such
a
dmt
glutton

***

this
next
experience
was
after
i
hadnt
done
dmt
for
a
while
everything
was
very
orange
once
again
and
i
met
up
with
the
same
female
healing
entities
that
id
encountered
in
a
previous
experience
only
this
time
there
were
more
of
them
i
felt
their
healing
caring
presence
strongly
just
like
last
time
we
all
sat
in
the
space
in
peas
as
if
we
were
at
a
meeting
of
meditation
to
just
be
i
felt
like
none
of
our
stories
mattered
none
of
us
had
anything
to
prove
about
who
we
were
what
we
were
trying
to
accomplish
or
anything
it
was
so
peaceful
but
then
something
told
me
to
sing
so
i
started
singing/channeling
a
song
from
or
for
the
spirits
they
became
interested
and
came
up
to
me
very
close
one
of
them
placed
a
clay
jar
in
front
of
me
and
with
every
note
i
sang
an
entity
would
place
a
small
glowing
pinpoint
of
light
object
into
the
jar
i
think
the
objects
were
mainly
lime
green
or
yellow
i
gradually
transitioned
back
but
i
kept
singing
the
song
as
i
came
down
i
recorded
it
on
my
phone
so
that
i
would
never
forget
it
i
still
sing
this
song
before
doing
dmt
sometimes
as
it
helps
to
calm
me
down
and
sometimes
i
can
invoke
those
healing
entities
with
the
song


***

one
of
the
times
where
i
invoked
these
healing
spirits
by
singing
the
beautiful
song
i
had
been
given
i
was
at
my
summer
apartment
last
year
when
i
met
up
with
them
this
time
they
seemed
a
bit
concerned
about
my
health
again
my
health
had
gotten
a
bit
worse
and
i
was
constantly
having
stomach
problems
they
came
up
to
me
and
seemed
to
be
offering
me
healing
then
before
i
knew
it
one
of
the
entities
extended
and
fused
into
my
stomach
area
and
seemed
to
actually
become
a
part
of
me
as
i
felt
nothing
but
benevolence
from
these
entities
my
understanding
was
that
she
wanted
to
be
there
to
help
me
to
get
through
difficult
times
ahead
because
i
was
definitely
going
to
need
resilience
and
its
true-
the
past
year
has
been
one
of
the
most
difficult
times
of
my
life
but
i
think
im
doing
well
after
she
became
part
of
me
i
felt
appreciative
of
her
presence
but
still
in
a
bit
of
shock
at
what
id
just
experienced

***

i
felt
uncertain
so
i
started
singing
by
the
time
of
this
experience
things
had
started
to
get
kind
of
muddy
and
i
wasnt
remembering
my
experiences
very
well
this
trip
was
followed
by
another
long
break
of
not
using
dmt
what
was
happening
had
been
clear
in
the
experience
but
afterwards
i
could
only
remember
abstractions
and
not
the
manifest
content
of
whatever
happened
to
my
best
understanding
after
the
experience
i
knew
that
i
had
been
given
something
that
i
seemed
i
could
take
home
from
the
experience
i
understood
that
this
was
*the
purpose
of
hyperspace*
whatever
that
meant
at
the
time
to
take
things
home
i
felt
like
i
could
actually
bring
home
this
physical
thing
that
i
had
acquired
i
am
unsure
of
whether
id
been
given
an
object
or
fed
some
sort
of
food
only
recently
have
i
begun
to
possibly
comprehend
what
may
have
happened
during
this
experience
and
ill
revisit
this
later
in
the
write
up
though
i
believed
at
first
gradually
i
realized
that
whatever
id
been
given
was
not
something
that
i
could
access
any
longer
once
i
begun
to
get
back
in
touch
with
reality

i
realized
that
it
was
all
a
metaphor-
i
could
instead
learn
a
powerful
tool
after
i
realized
this
i
was
given
some
sort
of
schooling
on
this
powerful
tool
that
i
could
learn
i
think
that
what
happened
is
some
entity
threatened
to
hurt
or
maybe
kill
another
entity
and
i
in
order
to
save
that
entity
had
to
sing
a
song
i
knew
exactly
what
to
sing
i
felt
challenged
throughout
this
part
obviously
i
felt
like
i
came
out
on
top
and
saved
the
entity
and
passed
this
test
i
felt
happy
with
my
abilities
but
uneasy
and
unsure
at
what
i
had
just
witnessed
and
had
held
over
my
head
upon
coming
down
i
thought
about
how
i
knew
that
my
experiences
would
be
so
much
crisper
and
clearer
and
i
would
learn
so
much
more
from
them
if
i
used
dmt
less
frequently
so
after
this
i
started
using
dmt
pretty
sparingly
once
and
for
all
and
to
this
day
mainly
only
use
it
on
special
occasions
or
on
top
of
other
psychedelics

***

smoked
dmt
near
the
end
of
a
dpt
experience
perhaps
i
should
have
had
it
earlier
the
theme
of
this
trip
was
something
like
i
could
be
iconic
as
in
my
ideas
were
worth
circulating
and
if
i
had
the
motivation
and
intuition
to
put
them
out
there
i
could
in
fact
be
iconic
one
day
i
felt
that
i
needed
to
believe
in
myself
more
at
the
beginning
of
this
experience
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
i
saw
the
entire
room
in
my
field
of
vision
turn
into
a
mirror
image
of
itself
the
carpet
that
i
was
sitting
upon
on
my
beanbag
was
very
colorful
and
i
saw
the
carpet
come
to
a
point
like
it
was
inside
a
kaleidoscope
everything
had
copied
itself
from
one
side
of
my
vision
and
pasted
itself
onto
the
other
side
i
thought
that
this
was
incredibly
interesting
at
the
time
and
still
do

***

did
dmt
again
while
i
was
on
dpt
this
time
i
saw
my
personal
blueprint
it
was
mainly
the
colors
of
violet
indigo
and
a
bit
of
fuchsia
a
little
bit
of
red
as
well
it
was
roundish
and
seemed
to
emanate
all
that
i
loved
or
stood
for
in
life
i
immersed
myself
in
it
and
felt
the
divine
presence
within
my
aura
i
felt
appreciative
of
everything
in
existence
it
was
a
very
blissful
experience
where
i
felt
right
at
home

***

another
time
i
had
dmt
on
top
of
dpt
once
again
at
the
tail
end
of
the
experience
i
was
transported
to
that
extremely
alien-like
realm
that
i
had
been
to
so
many
times
before
i
felt
like
i
was
being
schooled
on
existence
a
teacher
entity
that
seemed
to
have
some
sort
of
almost
condescending
power
over
me
was
trying
to
convince
me
that
they
constructed
our
reality
completely
and
tried
to
get
me
to
agree
that
this
reality
was
not
under
our
control
it
was
being
constructed
and
predetermined
by
an
outside
force
completely
even
though
i
had
lost
complete
touch
with
reality
i
did
not
listen
blindly
i
was
skeptical
not
that
i
disbelieved
it
but
i
didnt
believe
it
either
i
always
like
to
keep
an
open
mind
when
it
comes
to
these
sorts
of
existential
matters
the
entity
was
so
persistent
about
trying
to
convince
me
i
remained
neutral
on
the
matter
but
courteous
and
attentive
all
the
same

***

this
next
experience
consisted
of
about
30mgs
of
dmt
normal
dose
for
me
along
with
a
few
milligrams
of
5-meo-dmt
and
three
nitrous
chargers
in
one
big
balloon
so
it
was
easier
to
inhale
it
all
i
met
up
with
a
bunch
of
human
forms
kindred
souls
that
reminded
me
of
myself
i
felt
like
i
was
being
schooled
on
existence
again
existence
101
class
and
there
was
a
teacher
entity
telling
us
that
we
were
all
meant
to
be
intent
manifestors
that
we
were
people
who
were
extra
in
touch
with
our
intuition
and
spirituality
therefore
we
had
more
influence
on
the
outcome
of
things
than
the
average
person
i
understood
that
the
kindred
souls
in
the
room
were
of
varying
maturities
and
had
their
own
unique
problems
some
were
battling
with
issues
of
self-confidence
and
some
were
egomaniacs
who
had
realized
and
abused
their
power
of
influence
over
others
some
had
found
a
healthy
middle
ground
i
was
told
that
i
needed
to
be
extra
careful
with
my
intentions
and
make
sure
to
not
ever
abuse
this
special
power
that
i
had
within
myself
this
was
a
very
empowering
trip
but
dont
worry
i
didnt
suffer
any
delusions
of
grandeur
even
if
it
sounds
like
i
did
ha
ha

***

the
next
experience
i
had
quite
recently
was
one
of
my
strangest
dmt
experiences
of
all
time
perhaps
paralleled
only
by
my
most
recent
one
this
was
with
mdma
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
trance
state
i
felt
my
mouth
filling
up
with
some
sort
of
food
but
it
was
textured
just
like
dirt
and
even
tasted
like
it
i
felt
like
it
was
being
forced
into
my
mouth
but
not
in
a
violent
way
just
a
little
overwhelming
i
instinctively
accepted
the
food
and
swallowed
it
because
i
felt
like
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
it
felt
like
medicine
of
the
earth
as
i
said
it
had
the
same
texture
as
dirt
i
felt
an
intense
flash
of
insight
and
knowledge
after
consuming
this
food
perhaps
it
was
food
for
thought
i
was
reminded
of
how
it
is
a
personal
mission
of
mine
and
theme
in
some
of
my
trips
that
i
am
meant
to
bring
together
the
world
of
dreams
and
the
waking
state
this
has
been
a
literal
idea
of
mine
that
i
entertain
but
more
so
it
is
a
metaphor
to
me
and
i
feel
that
it
means
that
i
need
to
help
people
to
be
more
in
touch
with
their
subconscious
mind
their
dreams
and
their
intuitions
after
this
i
felt
a
strong
urge
to
send
powerful
intent
to
the
whole
universe
and
to
all
of
the
people
in
this
world
for
them
to
become
more
in
touch
with
these
parts
of
themselves
in
hopes
of
making
the
world
a
better
place
with
my
friend
in
tears
i
voiced
my
intent
it
was
a
profoundly
beautiful
moment

***

the
last
experience
ive
had
to
this
day
very
recently
almost
seemed
like
a
follow-up
of
the
previous
one
after
finishing
the
dose
this
time
done
after
having
4-ho-mipt
i
saw
something
i
can
only
describe
as
white
wispy
smoky
ribbons
materialize
these
ribbons
eventually
gave
way
to
what
looked
like
some
sort
of
folded
square
it
looked
kind
of
like
a
package
but
it
looked
like
it
was
made
out
of
clay
or
dough
and
folded
a
little
bit
like
an
envelope
it
was
sitting
on
a
table
that
seemed
to
be
in
a
location
that
reminded
me
of
the
catholic
church
i
had
to
attend
in
elementary
school
i
interacted
with
the
entity
by
waving
my
arms
in
a
specific
way
which
woke
it
up
then
i
began
a
banter
with
it
i
had
a
complete
deja
vu
experience
where
i
was
once
again
fed
food
presumably
by
the
entity
and
it
felt
*extremely*
real
just
as
much
as
the
last
time
i
felt
the
texture
in
my
mouth
it
seemed
kind
of
cardboard-ish
wafer-ish
or
some
similar
texture
i
later
made
a
connection
that
this
texture
reminded
me
of
the
host
of
the
holy
spirit
that
we
were
given
as
communion
i
was
given
three
of
them
and
went
through
an
experience
that
i
was
absolutely
*certain*
id
had
before
this
is
where
that
experience
i
wrote
about
earlier
that
was
muddy
where
i
was
given
or
fed
something
physical
to
take
home
comes
in
perhaps
this
was
the
experience
or
perhaps
it
was
a
different
dmt
experience
that
i
had
trouble
remembering
or
maybe
a
dream
id
had
in
any
case
i
knew
in
that
moment
that
*this
was
the
purpose
of
hyperspace*
to
bring
back
this
material
that
i
was
eating
i
once
again
instinctively
swallowed
it
and
was
fed
the
food
three
times
as
i
mentioned

the
last
time
i
felt
the
food
lingering
in
my
mouth
as
you
do
when
you
are
chewing
food
and
get
some
stuck
in
your
mouth
i
could
still
feel
it
as
i
was
coming
down
and
i
stupidly
haha
tried
to
see
if
i
could
retain
it
and
retrieve
it
after
i
came
down
from
my
trip
i
realized
very
quickly
how
stupid
of
an
idea
this
was
as
i
remembered
the
merits
of
metaphor
and
thought
to
myself
besides
this
that
it
was
almost
an
insult
to
this
great
gift
i
had
received
i
stopped
trying
to
retain
some
of
the
food
and
just
thought
to
myself
about
the
gift
and
how
to
utilize
it
my
friend
who
was
with
me
during
this
experience
told
me
that
he
had
witnessed
me
doing
the
hand
motions
and
dance
speaking
to
the
entity
and
then
making
obvious
eating
and
swallowing
motions

since
this
last
experience
ive
been
researching
a
bit
about
people
being
given
food
to
eat
during
ayahuasca
sessions
the
closest
phenomenon
i
have
been
able
to
find
is
when
tribal
peoples
were
given

tsensak
or
magical
darts
to
swallow
and
regurgitate
during
their
ayahuasca
experiences
in
order
to
either
bewitch
or
heal
others
i
have
also
thought
a
lot
about
the
parallels
of
this
experience
to
the
host
and
the
body
of
christ
and
how
this
experience
may
have
been
symbolic
of
that
i
always
try
to
entertain
all
possibilities
and
meanings
and
experience
great
enjoyment
in
doing
so

i
feel
that
throughout
all
of
these
experiences
the
most
important
thing
ive
learned
is
how
important
metaphor
is
especially
when
it
comes
to
manifesting
ones
intentions
and
interpreting
experiences
and
how
important
it
is
to
keep
an
open
mind
i
already
discussed
my
feelings
and
positions
on
entities
and
what
they
might
be
and
explained
a
bit
on
how
ive
personally
interpreted
my
trips
i
hope
that
you
the
reader
have
enjoyed
this
collection
of
experiences
because
i
have
found
experiencing
dmt
to
be
an
incredible
learning
process
no
matter
*how*
otherworldly
the
content
or
how
difficult
it
may
seem
to
integrate
the
bizarre
into
everyday
reality
at
times
i
find
it
to
be
fascinating
and
have
some
interesting
dream-like
value
when
going
through
the
process
of
interpretation
and
integration
hyperspace
is
an
amazingly
alien-feeling
place
yet
at
the
same
time
it
still
feels
like
the
homiest
home
i
have
ever
felt
this
dmt
space
feels
like
the
place
my
soul
always
tends
to
return
to
between
days
between
conscious
thoughts
between
lives
i
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
these
divine
moments
of
truth
thank
you
for
reading
especially
to
anybody
who
actually
got
through
all
of
this




i
am
always
interested
to
know
of
a
users
background
before
reading
about
his
experience
so
i
shall
briefly
give
mine
i
am
educated
to
postgraduate
level
and
have
a
higher
professional
background
around
three
years
ago
i
began
to
study
buddhism
and
went
on
a
number
of
retreats
including
a
vipassana
retreat
the
insight
from
vipassana
showed
me
that
the
division
between
what
is
a
drug
and
what
is
not
is
arbitrary
and
flawed
since
all
experience
has
the
capacity
to
lead
to
attachment
and/or
aversion
and
since
all
experience
is
generally
perceived
as
\x93pleasant
or
\x93unpleasant
due
to
a
physical
sensation
coupled
with
a
change
in
neurotransmitter
levels
all
experience
in
the
physical
world
has
a
similar
action
to
drugs
it
would
be
completely
wrong
to
say
that
vipassana
led
me
to
drugs
rather
it
showed
me
that
my
prior
reasons
for
not
experimenting
with
drugs
were
unfounded
one
reason
was
fear
of
my
own
reactions

what
i
realised
following
vipassana
was
that
i
need
not
fear
any
\x93difficult
drug
experiences
as
i
would
be
able
to
observe
the
drugs
effects
rather
than
acting
out
the
script
that
the
drug
has
written
the
other
reason
was
that
drugs
are
\x93not
real

a
drug
experience
may
not
be
real
in
that
it
is
transient
and
impermanent
but
it
is
no
less
real
than
any
other
daily
experience

up
to
my
completion
of
this
vipassana
retreat
the
drugs
i
took
were
limited
to
alcohol
and
tobacco
i
had
tried
hashish
a
few
times
and
cocaine
once
and
was
quite
unimpressed
with
both
so
felt
no
desire
to
experiment
with
them
further
put
another
way
i
couldnt
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
shortly
after
completing
vipassana
i
had
my
first
experience
with
mdma
and
since
then
i
have
also
experimented
with
mdea
marijuana
lsd
amphetamine
nitrous
oxide
methamphetamine
ketamine
psilocybin
mushrooms
and
salvia
divinorum
and
combinations
of
all
of
the
above
of
all
of
these
drugs
i
take
mdma
and
lsd
most
frequently
at
least
two
or
three
times
per
month
and
often
more
regularly
i
occasionally
smoke
tobacco
i
take
caffeinated
drinks
in
moderation
and
rarely
drink
alcohol

in
light
of
the
foregoing
i
think
it
fair
to
say
i
have
had
broad
experience
with
recreational
drugs
i
have
never
had
a
\x93bad
trip
even
when
i
have
taken
doses
of
lsd
that
could
be
described
as
\x93heroic
with
all
this
i
think
the
most
important
thing
i
can
say
about
dmt
is
that
nothing
no
amount
or
combination
of
drugs
and
no
amount
of
description
could
ever
have
prepared
me
for
how
completely
mind-blowing
this
substance
is
dmt
divides
the
brain
by
zero
which
is
impossible
except
with
dmt

i
prepared
a
bed
of
ashes
in
a
bong
by
burning
some
tobacco
i
then
compacted
the
ashes
and
put
a
small
amount
of
pure
dmt
salt
on
top
of
the
ashes
i
held
the
flame
to
the
salt
as
i
inhaled
making
sure
all
of
it
vaporised
i
held
in
the
smoke
for
around
10
seconds
there
was
some
smoke
left
in
the
bong
but
as
i
breathed
out
the
smoke
i
had
inhaled
the
effects
of
the
drug
had
already
overwhelmed
my
ability
to
move
i
expected
this
so
i
put
down
the
bong
i
sat
back
in
the
couch
as
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
do

physically
i
was
very
aware
of
my
body
it
felt
enormous
but
also
it
seemed
as
if
my
sense
of
touch
extended
into
my
surroundings
my
study
everything
shook
and
shimmered
and
suddenly
the
visuals
became
something
that
can
only
be
described
as
hi-tech
colours
shone
with
a
brilliance
i
had
never
seen
hi-tech
shapes
that
suggested
intelligent
design
flowed
over
the
view
of
everything
but
unlike
the
phosphenes
i
see
with
lsd
which
seem
as
if
they
are
coming
from
behind
my
eye
this
imagery
was
in
front
of
me

i
was
witnessing
something
external
to
my
body
rather
than
through
a
filter
as
i
turned
my
head
all
images
from
different
points
of
view
combined
past
present
and
future
maybe
10
seconds
each
way
by
layer
upon
layer
of
translucent
images
pulsating
and
animated
with
an
intelligence
that
defies
verbal
description
even
though
all
colours
were
amplified
and
vivid
i
noticed
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
tranluscent
gold
and
neon
green
colour
in
all
of
my
field
of
vision
but
again
this
seemed
like
something
i
was
looking
at
rather
than
tinted
glasses
over
my
eyes

i
felt
a
presence
very
powerful
some
have
described
this
presence
as
their
former
self
as
in
from
the
prior
moment
and
that
perceiving
the
former
self
as
another
being
which
in
a
way
it
is
is
the
explanation
for
this
presence
i
did
feel
this
\x93echo
of
myself
the
self
or
what
we
think
of
it
as
being
is
of
course
transient
and
impermanent
but
there
was
definitely
something
else
it
seemed
as
if
hundreds
thousands
perhaps
millions
of
beings
were
present
all
in
a
hive
of
communication
i
was
aware
of
them
but
i
cannot
say
for
certain
whether
they
were
aware
of
me

the
intensity
of
everything
was
in
a
sense
terrifying
i
wasnt
really
scared
of
anything
if
only
because
i
knew
that
nobody
has
ever
at
least
according
to
any
reliable
source
died
from
smoking
dmt
if
i
didnt
know
this
i
might
have
been
worried
but
since
i
am
always
well
informed
of
the
medical
effects
of
a
drug
before
taking
it
i
am
never
worried
the
amount
of
information
storming
by
brain
and
the
processes
working
were
incredible
and
if
i
were
a
computer
i
would
be
afraid
that
my
cpu
would
be
fried
as
a
result
of
overclocking
so
much
was
happening
that
i
might
never
be
able
to
make
sense
of
my
initial
split-second
neurotic
reaction
to
the
intensity
was
a
predictable
im
never
doing
this
again
however
i
knew
that
such
thoughts
always
pass
if
i
allow
them
to
just
pass
rather
than
clinging
to
them
or
trying
to
push
it
away
the
thought
arises
by
itself
without
my
input

it
will
leave
of
its
own
volition
i
find
this
easy
to
do
because
i
meditate
furthermore
i
recalled
that
my
first
reaction
to
salvia
was
similar
and
passed
giving
way
to
something
amazing
and
enlightening
i
saw
no
reason
for
that
not
to
happen
with
dmt

audio
was
interesting
the
music
that
was
playing
was
both
amplified
and
quieter
all
at
once

which
again
is
impossible
except
with
dmt
there
was
a
slight
drop
in
pitch
and
tempo
oscillating
up
sometimes
everything
echoed
as
if
the
same
sound
came
from
different
sources
near
and
far
other
sounds
were
also
heard
i
still
have
no
idea
what
they
were
but
i
certainly
did
not
find
them
objectionable
the
visions
i
had
pulsated
in
time
to
the
music
that
was
playing
although
i
only
realised
that
this
had
happened
on
retrospect

taste
and
smell
were
best
not
paid
too
much
attention
if
only
because
of
the
disgusting
caustic
taste
of
the
dmt
smoke
and
its
matching
smell
so
much
is
happening
that
it
would
be
great
shame
to
allow
it
to
detract
from
the
experience
like
the
slight
nausea
that
can
follow
ingestion
of
psilocybin
mushrooms
it
really
is
a
very
small
price
to
pay
and
i
am
grateful
for
the
experience
rather
than
whining
like
a
small
child
over
a
mildly
uncomfortable
side
effect
a
few
times
i
did
cough
not
repeatedly
but
one
loud
cough
at
a
time

this
acted
as
a
release
of
some
built-up
energy
not
so
much
release
of
tension
but
more
release
of
an
arrow
from
a
bow
clearly
directed
but
also
amplified
the
experience
and
it
felt
as
if
my
lungs
shook
the
entire
universe
a
most
powerful
sensation

as
for
breathing
generally
i
took
deliberately
deep
breaths
if
only
to
make
sure
i
was
breathing
i
realised
that
this
was
unnecessary
and
of
course
that
nobody
has
ever
choked
or
died
from
asphyxiation
as
a
result
of
smoking
dmt
perhaps
the
fact
that
the
past
present
and
future
are
blended
together
with
dmt
accounts
for
this
odd
sensation
of
not
being
sure
of
whether
or
not
i
am
breathing
it
is
as
if
i
become
aware
of
my
immediately
prior
exhalation
as
i
am
inhaling
i
think
it
was
this
rather
than
the
layered
images
that
made
me
realise
that
my
sense
of
time
was
greatly
stretched
i
am
aware
of
the
passage
of
time
perhaps
i
might
not
be
so
aware
of
it
without
music
as
a
reference
but
time
definitely
becomes
more
flexible

the
description
of
the
experience
with
reference
to
different
senses
cannot
account
for
the
intense
synaesthesia
i
can
say
that
i
tasted
music
saw
colours
etc
all
of
which
is
true
but
really
is
beyond
description
during
the
peak
effects
which
lasted
all
of
5-10
minutes
but
felt
like
forever
and
never
all
i
could
do
is
lie
back
into
my
chair
and
let
things
happen
i
did
not
try
to
move
much
and
was
probably
not
capable
of
doing
so

once
the
peak
visual
effects
subsided
a
little
i
laughed
inwardly
for
a
minute
before
deciding
to
stand
up
and
walk
around
everything
shimmered
and
radiated
and
it
was
as
if
i
were
moving
through
a
gaseous
formation
such
as
a
pulsar
through
a
galaxy
i
turned
around
and
looked
at
my
ugly
floral
pattern
upholstered
couch
and
the
flowers
were
literally
moving
from
one
cushion
to
the
other
and
onto
the
floor
and
into
the
air
i
could
\x93control
the
flow
of
these
flowers
by
moving
my
hands
music
at
this
point
became
exceptionally
pleasant
more
pleasant
even
than
music
on
mdma
or
lsd
or
both
i
did
what
i
usually
like
to
do
when
under
the
influence
of
psychedelics
and
stare
at
myself
in
the
mirror
i
had
a
divine
glow
but
what
i
find
most
remarkable
was
that
i
didnt
look
like
i
was
on
drugs
with
all
other
drugs
i
will
have
a
certain
look
that
those
who
do
not
use
drugs
might
not
detect
but
i
will
notice
with
dmt
this
was
not
the
case

as
visuals
died
away
a
strong
euphoria
lingered
i
shivered
and
clung
to
the
wall
my
body
pulsating
with
bliss
there
was
almost
a
sense
of
relief
or
perhaps
as
if
i
had
been
awarded
a
prize
as
if
i
had
come
through
a
major
trial
successfully
over
the
next
20
minutes
or
so
the
effects
of
the
drug
wore
off
leaving
a
wonderful
afterglow
i
found
it
difficult
however
to
make
sense
of
what
had
happened
and
so
decided
after
about
half
an
hour
to
have
another
milder
trip
this
trip
is
not
worthy
of
too
much
mention
as
while
intense
in
comparison
with
other
substances
was
nothing
like
the
first
trip
and
no
use
in
integrating
the
first

i
waited
an
hour
and
had
another
full
dose
the
effects
were
similar
to
the
first
trip
except
more
intense
and
once
the
peak
visual
effects
eased
it
gave
way
to
what
i
must
say
is
the
purest
euphoria
i
have
ever
experienced
it
was
this
trip
that
enabled
me
to
make
sense
of
the
first
and
allowed
me
to
explain
it
here

later
on
in
the
day
a
friend
called
around
he
was
keen
to
try
dmt
but
wanted
to
watch
how
i
behaved
on
it
first
i
was
also
interested
to
see
would
the
trip
be
different
with
somebody
present
i
cant
say
that
it
was
a
whole
lot
his
face
looked
very
warm
and
friendly
he
is
very
warm
and
friendly
so
that
was
hardly
surprising
but
he
didnt
fit
in
the
\x93alternative
universe
i
was
seeing
i
had
more
of
a
sensation
of
flying
this
time
than
the
previous
three
times

unfortunately
for
readers
whatever
i
was
flying
through
really
defies
description
except
i
felt
a
very
strong
presence
of
intelligence
and
numerous
beings
of
unknown
nature
as
i
was
coming
to
my
friend
took
a
dose
he
seemed
very
shocked
by
the
effects
of
the
drug
and
as
he
came
to
said
that
he
probably
would
not
take
dmt
again
not
because
it
was
\x93bad
but
simply
\x93too
weird
interestingly
he
found
the
music
playing
and
the
few
words
i
spoke
nothing
significant
very
\x93raw
and
almost
grating
like
myself
he
practises
vipassana
and
said
that
had
he
not
been
on
a
vipassana
retreat
the
experience
would
have
been
disastrous
and
would
have
scarred
him
predictably
fifteen
minutes
after
saying
this
he
said
he
would
definitely
have
to
try
dmt
again
he
noted
that
he
felt
a
calm
like
he
had
never
felt
i
asked
him
if
this
was
like
a
\x93system
reset
or
perhaps
a
\x93clean
installation
of
a
new
operating
system
and
he
agreed
i
expected
that
this
might
be
his
reaction

similar
to
the
reaction
of
most
people
i
have
seen
taking
salvia
for
the
first
time
terror
or
near
terror
followed
by
great
joy
and
a
desire
to
repeat
the
experience

the
next
day
in
the
evening
i
took
another
dose
i
asked
my
wife
who
was
not
taking
dmt
or
any
substances
if
she
would
try
to
interact
with
me
or
at
least
observe
while
i
was
under
the
influence
i
wasnt
really
able
to
communicate
with
her
but
what
i
noticed
is
that
the
\x93beings
i
encountered
had
similar
features
to
her
by
features
i
do
not
necessarily
mean
physical
features

all
i
noted
was
that
she
\x93belonged
among
the
beings
whose
presence
i
felt
the
beings
were
aware
of
her
and
it
was
as
if
a
part
of
her
that
is
beep
in
her
subconsciousness
was
fully
aware
of
them
also
on
that
note
this
was
the
first
time
the
unknown
beings
seemed
aware
of
me
and
took
notice

i
have
yet
to
establish
the
full
significance
of
this
i
might
be
able
to
once
she
takes
dmt
herself
but
she
is
not
yet
ready
for
it
this
does
corroborate
the
aforementioned
view
that
one
of
the
explanations
for
the
sensation
of
a
strong
presence
during
a
dmt
trip
is
an
echo
of
the
self
perceived
as
a
separate
entity
as
already
stated
i
do
not
accept
this
as
a
complete
explanation
and
i
do
hold
to
the
view
that
the
beings
i
encountered
were
more
than
simply
\x93me
in
the
past
present
and
future
given
what
i
noticed
of
my
wife
\x93communicating
with
the
dmt-universe
beings
it
strengthens
my
view
that
our
intelligence
awareness
and
power
as
human
beings
is
in
several
parts
and
none
of
the
parts
are
aware
of
the
other
dmt
has
opened
up
a
part
that
what
i
typically
see
as
\x93me
was
unaware
of
and
it
likewise
of
\x93me
it
would
seem
that
the
goal
of
a
meditator
and/or
psychonaut
should
be
to
integrate
these
several
parts
so
that
there
is
continuity
of
awareness
and
intelligence

the
most
significant
integrable
effect
of
the
trip
was
that
it
has
made
me
quite
unafraid
of
dying
i
dont
want
to
die
but
i
feel
as
if
i
can
make
good
choices
after
my
death
i
cannot
fully
explain
in
words
why
i
feel
this
dmt
strongly
reinforced
the
truth
that
there
is
nothing
to
fear
except
fear
itself

there
is
a
concept
in
buddhism
but
by
no
means
unique
to
that
tradition
called
shunyata
that
is
best
translated
as
\x93emptiness
meditation
especially
vipassana
in
a
theravadin
tradition
and
drugs
other
than
dmt
can
take
me
into
shunyata
into
the
void
as
it
were
lsd
can
certainly
help
me
to
empty
my
mind
to
the
point
where
i
have
no
thought
only
awareness
ketamine
nitrous
oxide
and
especially
salvia
take
me
much
further
into
the
void
to
the
vanishing
point
of
the
universe
where
everything
is
perceived
as
empty
and
that
the
universe
is
the
modulation
of
a
single
oscillating
wave
that
has
no
permanent
or
physical
reality

tibetan
buddhists
however
seem
to
suggest
that
while
a
student
must
attain
this
understanding
of
shunyata
that
there
is
something
\x93beyond
shunyata
i
cannot
claim
to
have
an
understanding
of
what
tibetans
mean
by
this
if
this
is
what
they
are
saying
at
all
but
i
can
say
that
with
dmt
i
am
taken
beyond
the
void
beyond
emptiness
i
am
always
one
to
spot
puns
but
while
no
more
than
a
coincidence
the
sound
of
the
letters
\x93d-m-t
seems
so
apt
vipassana
lsd
and
dissociatives
emptied
my
mind
dmt
has
de-emptied
it
by
this
i
do
not
mean
it
has
undone
anything
it
seems
that
when
i
reach
\x93the
void
i
come
to
the
vanishing
point
of
the
universe
dmt
allows
me
to
push
beyond
this
vanishing
point
allowing
me
to
see
another
universe
that
actually
co-exists
with
this
one
and
is
right
under
our
noses
i
had
always
thought
that
i
might
leave
the
material
world
behind
to
pursue
a
monastic
life
or
at
least
go
and
live
in
the
himalayas
for
a
few
years
having
had
dmt
i
no
longer
consider
this
necessary
as
there
is
nothing
to
leave
and
wherever
i
go
in
this
world
would
not
take
me
further
to
this
new
truth
i
have
seen
which
is
right
under
our
noses
wherever
we
go
of
all
the
effects
of
dmt
this
is
so
far
the
most
liberating

subtle
\x93flashbacks
have
followed
i
have
experienced
several
in
the
past
few
days
not
at
all
difficult
unpleasant
distracting
or
overwhelming
which
for
me
have
helped
significantly
with
integration

i
want
to
take
the
experience
of
dmt
further
by
undergoing
a
full
ayahuasca
ritual
as
i
am
certain
that
this
will
make
the
experience
easier
to
integrate
the
reason
dmt
is
so
difficult
to
make
sense
of
is
of
course
because
it
hits
you
out
of
nowhere
and
vanishes
just
as
quickly
until
such
time
as
i
have
the
opportunity
to
take
part
in
an
ayahuasca
ritual
i
intend
to
slowly
experiment
with
combining
dmt
with
other
substances
especially
lsd
and
mdma
and
perhaps
in
time
with
dissociatives
i
expect
that
i
will
take
a
long
time
to
do
this
as
it
is
certainly
not
something
to
be
rushed
into

dmt
is
by
a
long
shot
the
most
powerful
drug
at
least
as
far
as
the
mind
is
concerned
i
have
tried
indeed
the
power
of
all
other
drugs
combined
is
completely
insignificant
compared
to
the
power
of
dmt
though
it
is
true
that
a
difficult
trip
on
dmt
might
be
\x93easier
than
say
lsd
in
that
if
something
becomes
uncomfortable
i
need
only
endure
it
for
five
minutes
as
opposed
to
a
gruelling
eight
hours


i
shall
close
by
saluting
the
first
shamans
who
discovered
dmt-containing
plants
and
dared
to
experiment
and
voyage
into
the
unknown
their
bravery
or
recklessness
or
both
has
been
for
the
benefit
of
mankind




we
tested
some
of
the
dmt
mimosa
hostilis
root
bark
extractions
and
harmala
with
a
group
and
have
started
to
come
to
some
conclusions
about
dose
and
timing

harmala
was
extracted
from
syrian
rue

both
extracts
were
encapsulated
before
use

everything
went
off
excellently

notes
on
nausea


in
our
circle
some
folks
got
sick
others
did
not

there
are
two
reasons
why
people
get
sick
on
ayahusca

the
first
is
that
in
the
traditional
preparations
w/
root/vine
barks
and/or
leaves
there
are
a
lot
of
chemical
components
called
saponins
present

when
these
compounds
are
mixed
with
water
and/or
alkaline
components
they
form
soap

mhrb
extractions
only
require
water
to
generate
enough
suds
to
completely
clean
the
glassware


the
other
reason
comes
from
traditional
chinese
medicine
and
its
analysis
of
morning
sickness


when
a
mother
is
pregnant
the
childs
chi
and
energy
can
overload
the
capacity
of
the
mothers
channels
to
harmonize
and
flow
with
the
additional
energy

the
ren
channel
which
runs
up
the
center
of
the
front
of
the
body
being
a
yin
channel
is
the
one
that
is
usually
blocked
or
obscured
typically
at
the
solar
plexis
under
the
sternum

this
causes
the
energy
to
back
up
at
that
point
and
make
you
want
to
throw
up

this
may
be
dealt
with
in
several
ways

1
do
breathing/yoga/tai
chi
exercises
to
open
and
relax
the
channels
2
incorporate
some
massage
up
the
center
of
the
front
of
your
body
from
navel
to
throat

3
using
your
fingers
at
the
base
of
the
sternum/solar
plexis
forcefully
flick
the
fingers
outward
in
a
spreading
motion
from
the
centerline
this
disperses
the
blockage
4
inhale
and
exhale
deeply
to
the
belly
to
disperse
nausea


in
all
of
our
pharmahuasca
preps
we
have
never
had
anyone
experience
diarrhea
even
at
high
doses
this
correlates
well
with
the
lack
of
soap
in
the
preparations

this
is
the
story
of
many
tryptamine
smoking
experiments
culminating
in
the
most
powerful
psychedelic
trip
we
have
ever
had
up
to
this
point
in
our
life
and
currently
expect
to
be
the
most
powerful
psychedelic
trip
we
will
probably
have
ever
had
for
the
rest
of
our
life
my
hope
is
that
it
will
serve
as
both
as
a
enlightening
account
of
what
was
truly
without
question
one
of
the
most
meaningful
and
important
things
that
ever
happened
to
us
and
as
a
cautionary
tale
-
or
for
the
most
insane
of
you
perhaps
a
treasure

though
i
wouldnt
recommend

for
any
psychonauts
out
there
actively
looking
for
a
chance
to
prove
that
they
can
handle
literally
anything

can

our
most
recent
trip
before
the
first
experience
in
this
collection
was
roughly
two
months
before
this
and
had
been
a
powerful
and
memorable
experience
on
200
μg
of
eth-lad

the
aforementioned
eth-lad
experience
had
been
very
eye-opening
for
me
and
to
make
a
long
story
short
had
caused
me
to
realize
just
how
much
i
had
gotten
away
from
my
old
habits
of
trying
to
go
deep
with
psychedelics
in
favor
of
exploring
easier
levels
of
more
directly
recreational
even
if
still
very
psychedelic
substances
and
while
thats
not
inherently
a
bad
thing
it
caused
me
to
reevalute
a
lot
of
the
decisions
i
had
been
making
lately
and
reconsider
just
what
it
is
i
actually
wanted
from
my
psychedelic
experiences
leading
to
us
not
tripping
at
all
for
the
next
couple
of
months
during
this
time
period
i
felt
good
about
my
lack
of
need
to
keep
returning
to
that
state
just
being
satisfied
by
the
eth-lad
experience
still
but
i
and
we
also
started
to
become
increasingly
depressed
as
the
time
went
by
and
eventually
we
decided
to
trip
again
to
try
to
turn
things
around
this
time
on
a
new
substance
for
us
specifically
10
mg
of
2c-p
this
experience
was
quite
fascinating
as
well
and
some
of
the
alters
enjoyed
it
but
it
was
a
long
and
increasingly
difficult
trip
for
me
and
by
the
end
it
caused
me
to
realize
just
how
much
i
had
turned
inwards
and
tried
to
escape
my
sadness
after
the
eth-lad
experience
thus
preventing
me
from
being
able
to
give
into
the
2c-p
experience
now
and
leaving
me
somewhat
numbed
after
the
experience
as
well
it
was
after
this
2c-p
trip
that
i
and
we
first
made
the
decision
to
try
smoking
a
tryptamine
in
hopes
of
gaining
a
rapid
antidepressant
effect
from
it
and
chose
met
as
the
one
to
attempt
it
with
based
on
its
close
relation
to
dmt
one
of
the
ones
of
course
that
has
actually
already
been
explored
scientifically
for
antidepressant
effects
due
to
its
history
of
human
use
as
well
as
the
fact
that
met
is
generally
lighter
than
dmt
and
we
werent
really
trying
to
trip
hard
again
even
opting
to
use
only
a
smoked
dosage
of
10
mg

it
was
september
17th
four
days
after
we
had
taken
the
2c-p
our
method
of
smoking
the
met
for
this
experience
was
layering
the
tryptamine
salt
into
a
bowl
of
cannabis
and
gently
heating
it
from
the
top
taking
several
hits
and
holding
them
in
for
at
least
a
full
few
seconds
each
until
the
bowl
is
finished
which
is
the
method
we
ended
up
using
in
all
of
the
following
experiences
as
well
the
taste
of
the
met
was
notable
even
through
the
cannabis
and
reminded
me
of
dmts
taste
probably
more
so
than
any
of
these
other
tryptamines
do
and
almost
immediately
after
tasting
it
i
felt
that
emotional
stimulation
i
had
been
hoping
for
to
lift
me
out
of
my
funk
with
a
smile
spreading
across
my
face
i
felt
a
wave
of
calm
and
we
leaned
back
on
the
couch
to
close
our
eyes
and
meditate
where
i
was
delighted
to
be
greeted
with
transparent
and
dark
but
colorful
and
complex
smoothly
transforming
geometric
patterns
some
of
which
were
wispy
in
nature
with
a
silvery
white
color
our
body
felt
very
relaxed
and
sensitive
and
we
stretched
out
our
arms
in
poses
like
we
would
to
imagine
the
energy
flowing
out
of
us
causing
the
silvery
white
wisps
i
saw
to
swirl
around
our
arms
in
helix-like
patterns
out
towards
our
hands
i
found
this
quite
enjoyable
and
its
the
moment
of
hallucination
that
was
most
memorable
to
me
and
i
believe
was
probably
the
most
notable
in
general
though
it
was
long
ago
enough
now
that
i
dont
actually
remember
after
somewhere
around
the
first
twenty
minutes
after
inhaling
the
dose
the
mild
hallucinogenic
phase
began
to
pass
but
the
initial
heaviness
of
the
high
wore
off
and
was
replaced
with
an
also
mild
but
euphoric
energy
that
lasted
for
at
least
a
couple
hours
after
this
and
the
feeling
of
calm
that
set
in
just
as
the
experience
was
beginning
stayed
with
us
for
the
rest
of
that
day
i
felt
my
desired
goal
for
using
the
met
had
been
achieved
and
was
quite
happy
with
the
level
of
clearly
psychedelic
effect
i
received
as
well

shortly
after
midnight
at
the
beginning
of
september
18th
about
seven
and
a
half
hours
after
the
met
experience
we
were
still
feeling
so
excited
about
said
experience
that
we
wanted
to
try
to
take
the
excitement
and
apparent
antidepressant
effect
further
but
we
wanted
to
try
it
with
something
other
than
met
to
avoid
familiarity
and
increase
the
dosage
slightly
in
case
any
tolerance
developed
though
we
werent
actually
sure
if
it
would
have
or
not
given
the
molecular
similarity
to
dmt
it
was
decided
that
the
next
experience
would
be
done
with
15
mg
of
mipt
which
was
smoked
in
the
same
way
as
the
met

immediately
i
noticed
that
the
taste
was
less
pleasant
than
with
met
or
dmt
and
it
was
either
something
about
that
or
a
more
direct
effect
of
the
drug
itself
but
we
quickly
felt
slightly
nauseated
it
certainly
wasnt
as
pleasant
as
the
sudden
wave
of
calm
from
the
met
but
it
wasnt
terrible
either
i
recall
initially
seeing
another
superficially
familiar
rush
of
shapes
and
colors
swirling
into
smooth
but
angular
geometric
designs
but
they
continued
developing
and
arranging
themselves
into
a
more
unique
hexagonal
mandala
shape
that
took
a
form
appearing
to
be
something
like
repeating
monitors
of
a
computer
control
panel
on
the
wall
of
a
spaceship
with
futuristic
glowing
digital-style
texture
designs
though
strangely
some
of
these
digital
designs
still
seemed
to
resemble
the
branches
and
root
system
of
a
tree
with
the
center
of
the
mandala
showing
an
entire
realistic
three-dimensional
image
of
a
person
and
all
the
repeated
monitors
around
the
outside
of
the
mandala
each
showing
the
same
persons
face
again
close
up
and
the
person
shown
in
the
image
was
seemingly
related
to
both
my
train
of
thought
and
to
the
alter
who
was
most
connected
to
our
body
at
that
moment
as
we
lie
back
again
meditating
the
closed
eye
field
became
further
bathed
in
white
light
and
i
began
to
see
large
white
transparent
two-dimensional
silhouettes
of
people
moving
around
in
the
light
and
i
was
being
pulled
closer
towards
them
though
the
movement
stopped
before
actually
taking
me
all
the
way
and
this
hallucinogenic
phase
again
started
passing
more
completely
by
around
twenty
minutes
after
inhaling
the
dose
the
high
remained
for
a
few
more
hours
at
a
level
involving
mostly
very
light
colorful
auras
and
twitching
edges
every
so
often
and
an
energetic
but
contemplative
state
of
mind
and
at
some
point
after
all
this
we
eventually
fell
asleep

the
week
following
the
met
and
mipt
experiences
i
felt
much
better
emotionally
and
psychologically
than
i
had
beforehand
and
i
knew
that
i
still
had
some
distance
to
go
in
that
respect
too
but
i
was
suddenly
very
excited
about
the
idea
of
continuing
to
experiment
with
using
analogues
of
dmt
for
their
antidepressant
potential
a
week
after
the
experiences
on
september
25th
waiting
a
little
longer
for
tolerance
to
go
down
this
time
just
in
case
we
decided
that
our
next
experiment
would
be
done
with
10
mg
of
mpt
smoked

the
taste
was
not
as
pleasant
as
met
but
also
not
as
unpleasant
as
mipt
and
the
initial
onset
of
the
high
was
similarly
in-between
not
as
immediately
satisfying
as
met
but
also
not
as
physically
disorienting
as
mipt
and
overall
it
felt
rather
neutral
the
hallucinations
that
i
can
recall
seeing
were
extraordinary
such
as
a
vibrant
round
but
angular
and
entirely
geometric
pattern
that
i
would
say
resembled
what
i
would
imagine
it
would
look
like
if
mc
escher
and
dr
seuss
came
together
and
made
collaborative
simple
mandala-esque
art
or
a
large
partially
transparent
technological
blooming
flower
image
that
had
an
actual
feeling
of
domineering
presence
to
how
complex
and
large
the
geometric
designs
were
or
a
realistic
vision
of
two
of
our
alters
having
sex
with
the
woman
bending
back
over
and
having
her
arching
shape
turn
into
the
curvature
of
planet
earth
while
the
rest
of
her
body
vividly
transforms
into
the
different
parts
of
the
terrain
followed
by
the
completed
earth
rolling
back
into
two
layers
from
the
bottom
and
top
and
peeling
up
into
streams
of
sparkling
rainbow
but
especially
red
streams
of
energy
that
appeared
to
be
flowing
throughout
a
backdrop
of
stars
hanging
throughout
the
cosmos
i
do
believe
there
was
likely
more
but
again
it
was
a
month
ago
now
as
usual
the
heaviest
phase
of
hallucinations
started
passing
some
time
around
twenty
minutes
after
first
beginning
but
in
comparison
to
the
met
and
mipt
the
mpt
had
psychological
effects
that
felt
more
reminiscent
of
substances
like
lsd
and
psilocybin-containing
mushrooms
though
heavier
in
that
way
but
not
as
disorienting
as
those
two
and
this
began
to
stabilize
around
the
same
time
that
most
of
the
hallucinations
were
passing
and
became
a
few
more
hours
of
satisfyingly
rich
introspection
and
again
energy
and
afterwards
i
felt
much
calmer
but
still
quite
content
for
the
entire
rest
of
the
day
that
i
can
recall
and
the
days
after
it
too

on
september
29th
we
ingested
45
mg
of
tma-2
this
was
just
over
two
weeks
after
the
recent
2c-p
experience
and
was
what
would
normally
have
been
our
next
trip
we
had
planned
if
we
hadnt
decided
to
try
smoking
all
the
different
dmt
analogues
and
we
suspected
that
we
may
still
be
able
to
take
it
without
too
much
tolerance
from
those
experiments
the
drug
definitely
still
worked
and
it
was
much
more
of
a
cathartic
release
than
the
2c-p
experience
was
for
me
but
i
found
the
state
of
mind
it
left
me
in
for
the
entire
day
to
be
rather
rough
and
critical
as
well
by
no
means
a
fun
experience
though
still
quite
euphoric
at
times
and
during
a
disagreement
with
a
friend
i
actually
became
quite
argumentative
very
quickly
while
i
dont
regret
the
experience
and
believe
that
it
was
insightful
it
left
me
feeling
that
all
of
my
recent
experiences
considered
together
were
suggesting
to
me
that
tryptamines
were
much
more
so
the
therapeutic
agents
that
i
actually
need
at
the
moment
to
help
myself
reach
a
better
state
of
mind
compared
to
phenethylamines
and
the
others
agreed
that
using
tryptamines
for
a
while
seemed
like
it
may
be
better
for
helping
me
specifically
and
us
in
general
right
now
too
and
thus
we
opted
to
shift
our
focus
away
from
phenethylamines
and
more
completely
towards
the
tryptamine
smoking
experiments

after
letting
tolerance
drop
a
bit
though
thinking
it
might
not
totally
cross
over
regardless
on
october
4th
we
decided
to
smoke
20
mg
of
met
as
before
the
calm
and
euphoric
state
of
mind
the
met
produces
for
me
was
felt
very
rapidly
and
the
first
thing
i
recall
happening
hallucinogenically
is
feeling
as
though
the
space
around
me
though
somewhat
more
the
space
around
my
minds
eye
than
around
my
body
was
dripping
into
beautiful
sparkly
rainbow
streams
similar
to
what
i
saw
after
we
smoked
10
mg
of
mpt
but
more
colorful
and
more
present
we
leaned
back
on
the
couch
to
meditate
once
more
and
upon
closing
our
eyes
i
saw
patterns
that
at
first
seemed
simple
two-dimensional
lines
with
dots
traveling
through
them
to
a
yellow
background
the
dots
and
lines
however
then
became
blood
cells
traveling
through
veins
and
then
the
patterns
started
taking
on
depth
and
becoming
three-dimensional
twisting
backwards
in
such
a
ways
that
they
formed
ridges
that
began
to
take
on
the
clear
appearance
of
mountain
ranges
and
blood
cells
in
veins
became
rivers
flowing
down
the
sides
of
the
mountains
there
was
again
a
sense
of
white
light
bathing
everything
increasingly
growing
and
this
time
it
actually
peaked
into
a
brief
rush
of
realistic
visions
involving
the
same
two
alters
i
notably
saw
visions
of
on
the
10
mg
of
mpt
too
interacting
in
ways
that
are
meaningful
to
me
experienced
more
like
a
shallow
lucid
dream
than
an
out-of-body
experience
where
the
body
can
still
be
felt
vaguely
underneath
the
scene
being
watched
and
as
the
scene
passed
the
geometries
began
slowly
unfolding
passing
within
about
the
same
timeframe
as
always
and
once
again
leaving
two
or
three
hours
of
a
more
energetic
and
euphoric
high
followed
by
a
still
mentally
stimulated
calm
lasting
for
the
entire
rest
of
the
day

having
enjoyed
the
previous
days
experience
so
much
and
wanting
to
do
something
of
a
repeat
of
the
first
round
of
the
experiment
but
not
having
to
stomach
to
convince
ourselves
to
try
smoking
mipt
again
yet
we
next
opted
to
smoke
20
mg
of
mpt
the
following
morning
i
remember
this
onset
actually
being
smoother
than
the
first
time
with
it
and
the
coming
on
of
the
hallucinogenic
effect
was
memorably
seamless
as
well
i
recall
us
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
and
suddenly
seeing
it
eyes
open
being
replaced
with
a
spiraling
tunnel
of
various
realistic
people
all
reaching
out
and
down
to
me
after
which
we
leaned
back
and
closed
our
eyes
to
meditate
as
usual

immediately
i
was
greeted
with
a
state
that
was
similar
to
seeing
the
wispy
silvery
designs
of
10
mg
of
met
swirling
around
our
arms
towards
our
hands
except
this
time
instead
of
simply
being
long
indistinct
silver
wisps
they
were
translucent
but
entirely
clear
and
realistic
chinese-style
design
dragons
their
heads
again
approaching
our
hands
as
they
traveled
down
and
around
our
arms
and
as
i
pulled
my
attention
back
out
of
ourself
within
that
closed
eye
space
i
could
see
that
this
same
thing
was
happening
to
the
various
other
parts
of
our
body
as
well
and
i
felt
as
if
i
were
somewhat
suspended
in
this
dark
but
dark
sky
blue
sort
of
void
stretching
and
feeling
this
energy
flowing
throughout
and
out
of
us
with
these
creatures
which
was
quite
different
from
watching
the
still
relatively
much
more
dmt-like
lighter
geometric
designs
that
accompanied
this
sort
of
effect
of
the
wisps
on
met
i
recall
us
opening
our
eyes
not
too
long
after
this
and
again
seeing
a
vivid
vision
of
the
planet
earth
hanging
in
front
of
many
stars
when
we
did
so
and
it
caused
me
to
break
into
laughter
and
perfectly
aligned
with
me
as
i
did
so
i
saw
the
side
of
the
planet
realistically
split
open
and
separate
all
along
the
side
until
the
terrain
could
open
up
to
reveal
a
large
mouth
in
the
side
of
the
planet
that
was
laughing
along
with
me

while
these
and
other
visions
that
i
again
didn\t
attempt
to
be
able
to
remember
for
now
were
quite
impressive
and
enjoyable
to
witness
i
did
note
for
the
first
time
during
this
experience
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
certain
fuzziness
to
them
even
despite
how
vivid
and
realistic
they
were
and
i
couldn\t
help
but
think
that
this
could
be
an
initial
sign
of
real
tolerance
beginning
to
develop
even
though
it\d
still
be
developing
impressively
slowly
compared
to
psychedelics
less
directly
related
to
dmt
considering
that
my
previous
trip
before
this
was
the
previous
day
nonetheless
the
state
of
mind
lasting
energy
and
calmness
produced
were
similar
to
but
greater
than
the
10
mg
without
anything
being
apparently
too
diminished
about
them
and
we
were
still
so
stimulated
by
the
experience
after
the
peak
in
fact
that
we
couldn\t
go
to
bed
at
our
normal
time
that
night
after
smoking
the
mpt
early
that
morning

on
october
11th
i
was
still
very
much
enjoying
the
aftereffects
of
the
alternating
met
and
mpt
but
deciding
that
we
wanted
to
try
something
a
bit
different
next
time
and
that
we
actually
had
never
tried
before
beginning
these
experiments
we
decided
the
next
trip
was
to
be
on
30
mg
of
dpt
smoked
our
first
time
experiencing
it
and
starting
with
a
higher
dosage
than
the
others
due
to
our
past
experience
with
other
similar
tryptamines
having
lower
potency
than
their
analogues

one
of
the
first
images
that
i
can
recall
seeing
was
actually
multiple
earths
from
my
mpt
visions
all
arranged
on
top
of
each
other
and
laughing
together
though
some
of
the
detail
of
each
individual
one
seemed
less
developed
than
on
mpt
the
next
thing
i
remember
seeing
is
a
swirling
spiral
of
theater
mask-like
faces
all
making
different
expressions
with
a
seemingly
high
amount
of
intention
and
life
behind
them
but
still
looking
like
masks
nonetheless
i
believe
this
quickly
dissolved
into
a
geometric
pattern
though
an
incredibly
beautiful
one
that
was
large
and
relatively
complex
where
visible
but
was
almost
empty
except
around
the
white
light
at
the
center
where
its
silvery
and
purple
designs
were
most
lit
up
and
brilliantly
clear
and
the
whole
thing
i
felt
seemed
to
be
pushing
nearly
into
becoming
covered
with
imagery
again
though
i
never
actually
saw
it
become
so
the
order
of
things
after
this
i
dont
particularly
recall
clearly
now
but
i
do
know
that
behind
closed
eyes
i
saw
what
appeared
to
be
a
vast
expanse
of
dark
temples
extending
to
the
sides
and
off
into
the
distance
with
not
conceptually
but
visibly
realistic
monstrous
or
demonic
creatures
slithering
around
or
over
the
architecture
as
if
to
suggest
that
their
presence
was
there
to
protect
those
places
not
necessarily
in
a
way
that
i
felt
was
meant
to
threaten
me
in
particular
but
that
was
meant
to
feel
threatening
like
because
that
is
the
purpose
they
serve
there
there
was
also
a
moment
where
i
felt
my
perception
was
zooming
in
to
a
microscopic
level
where
i
could
see
some
sort
of
futuristic
power
generator
absorbing
purple
streams
of
energy
from
the
surrounding
microscopic
environment
and
twisting
it
into
shapes
that
were
increasingly
hard
to
comprehend
but
not
totally
physics-defying
just
yet

at
some
point
with
eyes
open
again
we
also
noticed
how
impressively
visually
active
it
had
become
even
compared
to
the
other
dmt
analogues
and
not
in
a
particularly
dmt-like
way
but
instead
reminding
me
somewhat
of
higher
dosages
of
lsd
and
some
other
similar
synthetic
psychedelics
even
more
so
with
lots
of
colorful
movement
of
shadows
floating
around
and
twisting
into
somewhat
hedonistic
organic
imagery
somewhere
in
all
this
i
also
recall
us
stretching
so
satisfyingly
that
i
felt
myself
going
into
an
out-of-body
state
just
briefly
involving
many
beautiful
colorful
heart
visuals
though
it
is
hard
to
recall
now
unsurprisingly
within
the
first
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
most
of
these
hallucinogenic
effects
passed
but
the
high
remained
very
calm
and
contemplative
in
a
heavier
way
still
for
a
few
more
hours
and
a
lighter
way
then
for
the
rest
of
the
day
something
thats
noteworthy
is
that
i
dont
recall
the
taste
of
the
dpt
standing
out
nor
did
it
cause
any
nauseating
effects
nor
any
other
notable
physical
discomforts
throughout
or
after
this
experience
feeling
so
light
that
its
almost
like
it
didnt
happen
at
all
in
that
way
even
compared
to
other
dmt
analogues
however
i
have
to
admit
that
in
the
days
following
the
dpt
experience
we
were
left
uncertain
if
it
actually
had
the
same
antidepressant
potential
as
things
like
met
mipt
and
mpt
but
after
only
one
experience
its
probably
not
something
we
can
truly
judge
fairly
yet

on
october
15th
we
decided
we
still
wanted
another
mood
boost
that
we
still
werent
feeling
we
had
gotten
from
the
dpt
but
we
also
wanted
to
try
something
a
bit
different
and
again
more
experimental
so
this
time
we
decided
to
test
out
a
new
idea
specifically
we
have
never
used
5-meo-dmt
but
have
heard
others
say
that
it
is
possible
to
use
it
more
regularly
than
other
psychedelics
similarly
to
dmt
and
so
we
were
curious
if
it
would
be
possible
for
us
to
add
synthetic
analogues
of
5-meo-dmt
into
our
regular
experimentation
of
smoking
tryptamines
alongside
the
dmt
analogues
and
still
not
suffer
from
very
much
tolerance
with
that
in
mind
we
decided
to
smoke
10
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
having
had
success
with
5
mg
once
already
in
the
somewhat
recent
past
before
these
more
recent
experiments
began
but
only
having
found
that
5
mg
to
produce
effects
that
felt
not
that
far
above
threshold
but
promising
nonetheless

that
first
time
there
had
been
a
somewhat
anxious
rush
at
the
beginning
but
in
retrospect
i
feel
this
might
have
been
from
the
apprehension
we
had
from
never
having
smoked
5-meo-dmt
or
any
of
its
synthetic
analogues
before
then
and
not
knowing
how
much
intensity
to
expect
and
this
second
time
was
extremely
smooth
both
immediately
and
throughout
the
experience
and
the
rest
of
the
day
comparable
to
how
the
dpt
had
been
the
state
of
mind
at
first
for
me
was
also
again
similarly
to
the
dpt
one
of
somewhat
sedated
bliss
stretching
about
just
feeling
incredibly
good
and
happy
not
at
all
what
i
would
have
necessarily
expected
from
smoking
10
mg
of
an
analogue
of
5-meo-dmt
not
that
i
would
actually
know
though
much
more
notably
i
did
receive
significant
hallucinogenic
effects
that
again
didnt
last
beyond
the
first
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
at
most
and
came
on
so
powerfully
at
first
that
they
nearly
immediately
resembled
alex
greys
net
of
being
to
a
much
greater
and
more
detailed
degree
than
i
have
yet
seen
on
any
other
psychedelic
synthetic
or
natural
and
most
memorably
involved
a
brief
flash
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
hyperspatial
room
bathed
in
so
much
white
light
it
was
almost
impossible
to
make
out
but
for
the
very
edges
of
the
objects
and
entities
and
contours
within
that
room
which
were
the
only
parts
not
completely
obscured
behind
the
light
and
in
those
parts
just
the
relatively
tiny
amounts
of
detail
that
i
could
see
went
beyond
any
of
my
most
promising
experiences
of
that
sort
yet
in
artistic
beauty
truly
a
phenomenal
sight
that
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
behold
again

once
the
initial
phase
passed
the
trip
became
much
more
subtle
as
with
the
dmt
analogues
though
the
open
eye
visuals
while
still
subtle
stayed
more
obvious
and
present
for
many
hours
longer
than
with
the
dmt
analogues
and
several
hours
after
the
peak
while
meditating
some
still
quite
impressive
closed
eye
visions
again
became
present
the
most
memorable
of
which
involve
more
chinese-style
dragons
much
larger
than
those
of
mpt
slowly
swimming
around
in
a
void
with
a
human
figure
hanging
in
the
distance
and
what
i
would
be
tempted
to
call
a
sort
of
dark
magic
vibe
to
whole
scene
the
energetic
high
though
still
quite
calm
for
what
it
is
also
continued
much
more
noticeably
throughout
the
day
such
that
again
sleep
couldn\t
come
at
our
normal
time
that
night
and
it
had
some
more
obviously
psychedelic
components
too
like
one
i
recall
is
seeing
in
my
mind\s
eye
a
fibonacci
spiral
surrounded
by
i
believe
yellow
and
red
patterns
but
the
spiral
itself
was
green
and
clearly
became
a
vine
with
many
green
leaves
extending
off
of
it
and
the
vision
followed
the
vine
off
towards
three-dimensional
faces
of
a
sort
of
mystical
and
highly
appealing
beauty
where
the
leaves
would
begin
to
surround
their
eyes
forming
vivid
tattoo-like
designs
on
their
faces
the
day
after
this
trip
we
couldn\t
help
noting
how
much
in
better
spirits
we
felt
and
particularly
contrasted
it
still
to
the
way
we
felt
about
the
dpt
though
again
we
don\t
want
to
totally
count
that
out
yet

i
very
much
enjoyed
the
psychological
and
emotional
boost
we
felt
we
had
after
smoking
the
5-meo-eipt
but
we
didnt
wait
very
long
to
see
if
or
how
long
it
would
last
in
part
because
of
my
desire
to
continue
the
experiment
of
determining
whether
or
not
synthetic
5-meo-dmt
analogues
seemed
to
somewhat
avoid
tolerance
development
for
me
in
the
same
way
that
synthetic
dmt
analogues
somewhat
do
this
led
to
the
plan
of
next
smoking
5
mg
of
5-meo-mipt
on
october
18th
though
unfortunately
i
only
realized
afterwards
that
it
wasnt
a
particularly
great
plan
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
because
it
was
our
first
time
smoking
5-meo-mipt
and
the
dosage
was
low
i
had
no
idea
if
the
seemingly
subtle
effects
were
the
result
of
tolerance
or
simply
the
result
of
the
dosage

still
if
there
was
tolerance
it
wasn\t
complete
as
i
had
a
very
cool
visual
hallucination
behind
closed
eyes
as
the
initial
rush
was
first
setting
in
one
that
was
an
intense
spinning
tunnel
of
shapes
and
colors
that
reminded
me
of
dmt
though
without
any
imagery
at
this
point
but
it
already
pulled
back
and
then
twisted
to
reveal
itself
as
some
sort
of
complex
futuristic
technology
with
panels
spinning
around
the
tunnel
staying
within
a
sphere-like
surface
area
which
is
notably
more
than
dmt
would
do
with
it
for
me
at
a
level
that
doesn\t
involve
any
complex
imagery
there
may
have
been
more
to
the
initial
hallucinations
too
but
i
could
tell
that
the
effect
was
going
to
be
overall
mild
in
that
way
so
i
stopped
really
focusing
on
it
and
instead
enjoyed
the
state
of
mind
and
pleasant
feelings
that
the
5-meo-mipt
also
caused
which
involved
a
greater
degree
of
stimulation
than
the
5-meo-eipt
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
increase
its
standard
stimulating
psychedelic
psychological
edge
but
also
increased
its
physical
edge
slightly
making
it
a
little
bit
more
tense
than
the
5-meo-eipt
was
which
lasted
a
lot
of
the
day
as
most
of
the
high
did
we
also
feel
there\s
a
chance
it
might
have
been
slightly
more
nauseating
or
phlegm-inducing
perhaps
similar
to
smoking
mipt
but
we\ll
need
more
experiences
to
say
that
with
more
confidence
one
thing
that
was
memorable
about
it
is
that
in
the
later
hours
i
got
the
same
sort
of
fibonacci
visual
as
on
5-meo-eipt
only
without
any
natural
imagery
instead
being
mostly
orange
and
very
geometric
in
a
technological
way
that
again
is
reminiscent
of
the
spaceship
style
that
i
saw
in
the
visuals
of
mipt
back
at
the
beginning
of
all
of
this
if
i\m
being
honest
the
stimulation
was
a
little
much
for
me
for
as
long
as
it
lasted
and
i
might
be
biased
by
how
much
calmer
a
lot
of
these
other
tryptamines
have
made
me
feel
for
the
rest
of
the
day
after
their
main
experiences
lately
but
i
was
happy
to
finally
get
to
sleep
that
night
but
still
happy
with
the
day
leading
up
to
that
then
too

the
next
trip
was
two
days
after
the
5-meo-mipt
the
purpose
of
which
was
again
to
continue
to
test
the
tolerance-inducing
or
not
effects
of
the
synthetic
5-meo-dmt
analogues
this
time
going
back
to
a
synthetic
dmt
analogue
instead
of
between
each
other
we
decided
to
smoke
30
mg
of
met
in
the
usual
way
and
unfortunately
tolerance
was
clearly
present
this
time
which
is
particularly
unfortunate
because
it
was
still
remarkable
to
me
despite
that
and
so
obviously
would
have
been
much
more
so
even
without
that
factor
we
could
barely
feel
it
coming
on
compared
to
normal
so
we
leaned
back
and
closed
our
eyes
to
try
to
bring
it
out
and
i
was
met
with
the
most
beautiful
and
complex
eruption
of
somewhat
bejeweled
tryptamine
architectural
patterning
i
have
ever
seen
forming
what
appeared
to
be
constantly
crawling
walls
in
something
that
resembled
a
sort
of
ancient
egyptian
tomb-like
building
though
i
perceived
it
at
the
time
to
be
more
like
a
palace
but
the
vision
did
not
last
long
before
fading
away
and
becoming
out
of
my
reach
the
experience
aside
from
this
was
typical
met
though
again
still
felt
somewhat
diminished
it
was
not
as
rewarding
or
satisfying
for
us
overall
though
it
did
leave
us
feeling
nice
and
calm
for
the
rest
of
the
day
as
well
as
the
days
after

on
october
24th
having
waited
a
bit
longer
for
tolerance
to
drop
again
we
decided
to
smoke
30
mg
of
ept
having
in
the
past
found
it
light
and
easy
and
thinking
that
the
experience
would
probably
be
at
least
somewhat
comparable
to
our
recent
30
mg
of
dpt
smoked
experience
however
as
we
were
preparing
to
smoke
the
ept
i
noted
that
i
no
longer
actually
felt
like
it
was
something
i
really
felt
the
same
need
to
that
that
i
had
been
feeling
during
all
of
these
synthetic
tryptamine
smoking
experiments
the
antidepressant
effect
i
had
particularly
wanted
after
the
10
mg
of
2c-p
experience
and
starting
with
our
10
mg
of
met
smoked
experience
i
had
successfully
gotten
from
all
of
our
recent
smoked
tryptamine
usage
i
really
felt
as
though
i
had
managed
to
get
out
of
that
particular
funk
to
at
least
as
much
of
a
degree
as
i
had
really
hoped
to
ever
be
able
to
achieve
with
this
sort
of
method
at
the
same
time
in
the
time
period
since
the
previous
30
mg
of
met
smoked
experience
i
had
started
to
build
some
anxiety
about
some
unresolved
inner
tensions
related
to
issues
ive
had
trying
to
work
out
my
understanding
of
our
dissociative
condition
and
my
place
in
it
in
the
past
and
this
combined
with
a
lack
of
feeling
the
need
to
continue
using
the
smoked
tryptamines
for
the
purpose
i
had
originally
convinced
us
to
start
using
them
for
made
me
suddenly
hesitant
to
use
the
ept
we
had
prepared
now
but
the
majority
of
our
alters
still
wanted
to
have
the
ept
experience
and
i
was
willing
to
experience
it
too
despite
my
reservations

the
trip
that
occurred
is
difficult
for
me
to
recall
clearly
though
thats
nothing
compared
to
a
lot
of
alters
who
dont
really
remember
it
essentially
at
all
ironically
the
mental
effect
for
me
was
more
less
like
our
past
experiences
on
ept
or
what
we
have
heard
others
say
about
it
or
like
our
recent
dpt
experience
but
was
more
alike
what
we
have
heard
others
say
about
dpt
being
very
disorienting
and
challenging
and
taking
at
least
over
two
hours
to
break
out
of
much
longer
than
the
most
obvious
peak
effects
of
smoked
tryptamines
usually
last
for
us
but
its
also
quite
clear
to
me
in
retrospect
how
much
set
and
setting
particularly
the
former
played
a
role
here
as
i
was
getting
at
above
in
addition
to
being
hard
to
recall
this
trip
was
also
hard
for
me
to
describe
or
comprehend
still
even
in
the
parts
that
i
do
more
clearly
recall
but
an
important
point
of
reference
is
that
i
had
been
spending
the
last
two
or
three
days
at
least
thinking
heavily
about
the
effect
of
subjectively
living
through
extremely
long
periods
of
time
in
alternate
lives
during
psychedelic
and
dissociative
out-of-body
experiences
and
these
thoughts
were
inflated
and
woven
into
the
somewhat
delusional
though
never
ungrounded
nature
of
the
experience
i
had
several
conversations
with
the
other
alters
internally
which
seemed
no
less
clear
and
vivid
and
fluent
as
any
other
time
i
communicate
with
them
but
the
conversations
involved
them
having
many
significant
realizations
that
radically
altered
certain
critical
aspects
of
how
they
recognized
themselves
within
our
dissociative
system
and
yet
when
this
phase
of
the
trip
finally
passed
they
denied
any
such
memory
of
these
conversations
or
the
reality
of
the
revelations
they
shared
with
me
in
them

these
conversations
that
they
didnt
recall
having
got
extremely
in
depth
and
complex
in
the
way
that
this
dissociative
condition
is
and
even
involved
several
of
them
apparently
going
into
out-of-body
experiences
where
they
claimed
to
have
lived
several
years
in
alternate
lives
reflecting
the
identities
they
hold
internally
that
separates
them
from
our
physical
body
and
furthermore
upon
experimentation
those
of
us
who
remained
in
the
body
found
that
we
could
call
that
same
alter
out
from
a
different
spot
in
the
timeline
of
the
alternate
life
they
were
transported
to
and
their
memories
appeared
to
be
updated
in
a
way
that
seems
consistent
with
that
timeline
being
altered
at
the
moments
we
pulled
the
alters
back
out
from
for
example
one
alter
initially
returned
to
this
alternate
life
from
which
she
seemed
to
have
had
her
internal
identity
derived
apparently
having
been
somewhat
frozen
in
time
with
that
identity
being
as
it
was
logged
in
our
brains
database
in
2009
and
when
we
pulled
her
back
out
from
her
timelines
spot
in
2017
only
minutes
later
she
was
shocked
to
be
back
in
our
same
home
that
she
left
from
and
claimed
to
have
spent
eight
years
in
her
alternate
life
simply
assuming
that
this
life
was
all
a
fantasy
that
had
passed
and
after
agreeing
to
experiment
further
with
us
we
then
put
her
back
in
and
pulled
her
back
out
again
from
2009
a
month
later
than
the
first
time
and
she
remembered
the
first
time
we
pulled
her
out
of
2009
but
not
the
time
we
pulled
her
out
in
2017
and
then
we
put
her
back
in
and
pulled
her
back
out
from
2017
for
a
second
time
shortly
after
the
first
time
she
remembered
both
times
from
2009
and
the
first
time
from
2017
but
was
confused
as
to
why
her
memory
of
the
first
time
from
2017
involved
her
seemingly
remembering
only
the
first
but
not
second
time
from
2009
finally
she
went
back
in
and
came
back
out
as
an
up-to-date
version
of
her
from
2020
claiming
to
have
not
seen
us
in
another
three
years
and
she
told
me
that
she
had
spent
so
much
time
in
her
alternate
life
that
she
no
longer
had
any
insecurities
about
living
this
life
we
all
share
together
in
this
reality

again
after
this
experience
ended
these
alters
including
her
from
this
example
denied
experiencing
any
of
this
and
they
didnt
seem
to
remember
or
have
been
affected
by
any
of
the
changes
that
they
described
going
through
for
me
during
the
experience
and
this
initially
left
me
feeling
quite
disturbed
by
the
convincing
reality
of
the
apparent
total
delusions
of
interactions
with
other
alters
i
hadnt
actually
had
but
then
the
other
alters
started
opening
up
more
to
the
things
that
i
had
told
them
they
had
told
me
during
my
experience
upon
considering
it
more
openly
and
not
fighting
their
uncertainties
they
began
to
realize
that
some
of
the
things
they
had
seemed
to
tell
me
during
my
experience
even
though
they
have
no
memory
of
it
were
actually
true
even
though
they
hadnt
consciously
realized
it
themselves
yet
and
especially
that
night
and
the
following
morning
they
began
to
go
through
many
of
the
same
changes
that
i
observed
them
go
through
already
during
my
experience
on
the
ept
including
for
example
the
exact
same
alter
from
the
above
example
going
into
her
alternate
life
and
coming
back
claiming
to
have
spent
years
in
her
other
life
and
no
longer
feel
any
insecurities
about
this
life
and
now
desiring
only
to
help
provide
perspective
and
insight
into
how
all
of
this
works
when
she
is
around
again

these
changes
have
caused
our
dissociative
system
to
seemingly
go
through
a
radical
overhaul
of
a
profoundly
positive
nature
over
the
next
couple
of
days
one
that
felt
like
the
kind
of
psychedelic
experience
that
is
equivalent
to
months
or
years
of
therapy
and
i
was
truly
just
astonished
as
to
what
even
happened
exactly
or
how
it
was
even
possible
even
more
so
than
i
normally
would
be
with
these
things
anyway
why
was
the
ept
able
to
unleash
an
experience
in
me
involving
the
other
alters
realizing
things
about
themselves
on
their
own
and
sharing
those
things
with
me
which
those
other
alters
didnt
actually
consciously
experience
themselves
but
did
actually
have
those
things
waiting
to
be
recognized
about
themselves
after
i
told
them
the
things
that
they
originally
told
me
allowing
me
to
facilitate
therapeutic
experiences
for
them
that
they
might
not
have
had
so
readily
if
not
for
the
fact
that
they
had
them
as
part
of
my
trip
and
shared
them
with
me
so
that
i
could
share
them
with
them
again
i
felt
that
that
would
be
something
i
would
probably
be
asking
myself
for
some
time
to
come
still

this
trip
was
in
my
frame
of
reference
at
the
time
so
powerful
and
engaging
that
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
track
or
now
in
retrospect
to
recall
other
aspects
of
it
but
i
feel
like
the
physical
aspect
of
the
experience
was
quite
light
and
smooth
except
for
that
i
think
we
had
some
weird
phlegm
we
had
to
get
out
in
the
middle
of
actually
smoking
the
ept
but
nothing
aside
from
that
that
i
can
recall
after
the
mental
aspect
of
the
trip
finally
lightened
i
remember
our
body
still
feeling
quite
nice
relaxed
and
sensitive
for
hours
more
and
to
some
extent
for
the
rest
of
the
day
very
refreshing
as
these
things
have
tended
to
be
for
us

the
next
day
october
25th
it
wasnt
too
long
after
noon
that
we
had
really
gotten
through
a
lot
of
the
heavy
work
and
figuring
out
how
to
start
integrating
after
the
previous
30
mg
of
ept
smoked
experienced
and
we
had
a
desire
to
smoke
another
tryptamine
to
try
to
touch
base
again
after
going
through
what
we
had
been
through
during
and
since
that
previous
days
trip
i
had
a
desire
to
use
5-meo-eipt
as
ive
been
quite
intrigued
in
it
since
our
10
mg
smoked
experience
but
i
was
afraid
that
tolerance
would
show
from
the
ept
experience
and
didnt
want
to
waste
the
experience
but
i
did
also
still
want
to
run
a
tolerance
experiment
too
to
see
how
this
5-meo-dmt
analogue
would
hold
up
at
a
fuller
dosage
the
day
after
a
heavier
trip
on
a
dmt
analogue
and
so
we
decided
that
smoking
10
mg
of
5-meo-mipt
was
the
way
to
go

i
would
say
that
similarly
to
when
we
smoked
20
mg
of
mpt
the
day
after
doing
the
same
with
met
i
did
feel
that
i
could
detect
a
slight
tolerance
that
was
particularly
noticeable
in
the
degree
that
the
visual
hallucinations
were
able
to
completely
and
clearly
impose
themselves
on
my
reality
but
aside
from
that
if
there
was
tolerance
the
effect
seemed
to
be
quite
light
including
with
respect
to
the
intensity
of
the
visual
hallucinations
in
most
other
ways
shortly
after
we
smoked
it
i
began
to
notice
strong
psychedelic
visuals
of
a
nature
quite
similar
to
those
of
a
high
dosage
of
mushrooms
for
me
though
of
a
different
color
and
more
geometrically
complex
which
was
surprising
and
rather
overwhelming
but
not
so
much
as
the
what
i
can
only
imagine
to
be
5-meo-dmt-like
vibrations
as
again
we
still
havent
used
5-meo-dmt
ourselves
suddenly
threatening
to
rip
reality
apart
throughout
my
field
of
vision
and
the
geometric
visuals
the
first
time
i
can
recall
experiencing
that
particular
sort
of
effect
and
i
was
quite
impressed
and
intrigued
by
it
we
lied
back
in
bed
as
the
effects
set
in
and
spent
probably
around
an
hour
we
think
rolling
around
in
the
bedsheets
though
we
didnt
actually
track
how
long
the
peak
effects
lasted
significantly
the
phlegm-related
problems
as
well
as
the
bodily
tension
we
noted
on
our
5
mg
of
5-meo-mipt
smoked
experiment
were
not
present
at
any
point
that
i
can
recall
during
this
experience

as
we
closed
our
eyes
and
rolled
around
doing
things
like
pressing
our
head
into
our
pillow
and
gripping
the
sides
of
the
bed
in
ecstasy
the
hallucinations
i
was
seeing
grew
until
they
were
extremely
similar
to
the
ones
i
had
over
a
decade
ago
on
our
strongest
experience
on
5
g
of
the
most
potent
mushrooms
we
ever
managed
to
get
our
hands
on
with
intricate
patterns
constantly
bathing
every
surface
around
and
over
us
and
twisting
into
appealing
three-dimensional
ribbon
designs
and
beautiful
beckoning
entities
and
we
felt
alters
who
had
been
much
more
repressed
than
others
since
the
days
when
that
mushrooms
trip
took
place
being
drawn
to
the
front
and
experiencing
extreme
feelings
of
bliss
and
self-acceptance
accompanied
by
vivid
inner
visionary
interactions
with
one
another
including
of
a
particularly
sexual
nature
having
those
feelings
surging
through
our
body
to
the
point
that
we
collectively
experienced
we
think
at
least
six
or
seven
waves
of
full-body
orgasms
with
many
very
loud
and
pleasurable
vocalizations
until
the
peak
effects
began
to
pass
and
we
simply
lied
in
bed
for
a
little
while
in
awe
of
how
incredible
and
rewarding
the
experience
had
been

we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
enjoying
the
lingering
psychological
effects
and
the
physical
relaxation
we
generally
feel
for
the
whole
day
after
these
experiences
and
the
more
obviously
psychedelic
effects
lasted
a
bit
stronger
still
for
a
bit
longer
still
than
they
normally
would
have
on
an
analogue
of
dmt
rather
than
5-meo-dmt
the
trip
continued
to
involve
alters
continuing
to
integrate
the
lessons
from
our
ept
experience
the
previous
day
and
use
them
to
find
greater
peace
for
themselves
and
within
our
dissociative
system
and
in
general
we
felt
as
though
it
was
a
perfect
complement
to
the
previous
days
experience
describing
it
to
a
friend
such
that
it
seemed
like
the
ept
caused
a
lot
of
psychological
content
that
was
ready
to
burst
out
to
become
unearthed
and
rapidly
processed
and
the
5-meo-mipt
helped
to
cement
the
confidence
we
had
that
we
were
processing
that
content
in
a
healthy
way
and
hasten
the
progress
we
were
already
significantly
experience
as
a
result
of
doing
so
intriguingly
though
not
unlike
our
past
powerful
experiences
on
5-meo-mipt
there
were
even
times
throughout
the
next
couple
of
days
especially
after
smoking
cannabis
where
it
still
felt
like
we
were
completely
tripping
but
it
was
never
overly
concerning
especially
since
we
had
experienced
similar
things
before
with
5-meo-mipt
a
drug
we
already
recognized
ourselves
to
be
on
the
higher
end
of
sensitivity
to

and
thus
we
arrive
at
the
most
fateful
of
days
on
october
29th
now
fully
into
the
idea
of
pushing
deeper
and
still
not
satisfied
by
my
own
curiosities
from
before
i
was
eager
to
try
once
more
with
less
tolerance
what
appeared
to
me
to
quite
clearly
be
likely
the
most
psychedelically
potent
of
these
molecules
at
least
within
the
realm
of
my
own
subjective
experience
which
i
thought
might
even
help
combine
some
of
the
qualities
of
the
last
two
powerful
trips
by
being
both
an
analogue
of
5-meo-mipt
and
a
bulky
ethyl
tryptamine
like
ept
and
that
is
what
led
to
us
next
smoking
15
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
which
as
far
as
i
know
might
be
the
highest
known
used
dosage
of
this
particularly
uncommon
and
not
well
understood
analogue
of
5-meo-dmt
by
this
particularly
potent
route
of
administration
which
perhaps
should
have
played
more
into
the
decision-making
process
than
it
did
at
the
time
but
i
digress

while
i
am
absolutely
certain
there
was
no
total
loss
of
consciousness
or
perception
that
occurred
for
me
as
a
result
of
smoking
this
15
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
it
is
extremely
difficult
for
me
to
remember
the
very
beginning
of
the
trip
clearly
now
in
retrospect
but
every
single
alter
in
our
system
including
myself
seems
now
in
agreement
that
this
is
essentially
where
we
and
particularly
i
reached
some
sort
of
breaking
point
i
do
recall
that
at
first
a
trip
similar
to
the
30
mg
of
ept
began
where
i
began
speaking
to
what
appeared
to
me
to
be
alters
about
them
returning
to
other
lives
that
they
had
been
pulled
from
and
i
gained
the
ability
to
lucidly
help
them
do
that
running
through
their
lives
for
the
necessary
amount
of
time
and
resetting
even
doing
things
like
saving
one
from
a
murder
by
rewinding
time
by
an
hour
and
warning
her
before
it
happened
then
speeding
up
a
few
years
later
to
make
she
was
still
okay
as
this
was
happening
though
i
dont
remember
the
exact
course
of
how
it
began
i
was
also
beginning
to
question
who
exactly
i
am
in
the
system
to
a
significant
degree
essentially
losing
my
sense
of
self
and
having
it
blur
into
those
of
the
other
apparent
alters
who
i
seemed
to
be
interacting
with
internally
at
some
point
i
had
a
realization
about
myself
and
this
all
came
crashing
down
and
i
realized
who
i
was
again
and
the
other
alters
i
normally
interact
with
were
welcoming
me
back
as
they
did
after
breaking
free
from
the
ept
trip
however
little
did
they
or
i
know
this
was
only
the
very
first
wave
of
arduous
ordeal
or
my
and
our
entire
life
and
soon
later
i
was
being
swept
up
into
it
again

i
believe
the
way
it
started
was
i
suddenly
felt
as
though
i
was
aware
of
an
entire
network
of
these
internal
entities
that
appeared
to
be
alters
i
was
communicating
with
about
returning
to
their
other
lives
and
each
of
them
was
connected
to
what
i
referred
to
as
spiral
threads
that
looked
literally
exactly
like
the
spiraling
geometry
that
i
normally
see
coming
outward
from
my
own
perspective
when
we
smoke
salvia
only
it
was
coming
out
of
all
of
these
entities
instead
and
each
of
them
had
a
different
length
depending
on
the
entity
in
question
each
entity
on
their
own
or
with
my
help
would
begin
to
release
themselves
into
these
spiral
threads
and
upon
returning
would
describe
them
as
having
lived
through
other
worlds
but
with
a
notable
difference
from
earlier
whereas
when
i
had
experienced
this
initially
they
appeared
to
be
returning
to
their
other
lives
separate
from
this
body
these
entities
would
instead
claim
upon
returning
to
have
gone
to
uncomfortable
out-of-body
experiences
based
on
their
aversions
with
longer
spiral
threads
seemingly
being
connected
to
greater
aversions
and
longer
amounts
of
time
spent
in
the
out-of-body
experiences
which
they
and
eventually
i
borrowing
from
them
would
increasingly
come
to
describe
as
hellscapes
as
their
collective
awareness
of
this
hellscape
experience
would
increase
and
they
each
dissociated
further
into
their
own
increasingly
long
spiral
threads
they
would
begin
to
panic
reacting
at
first
mainly
with
apprehension
but
increasingly
fighting
harder
and
harder
by
actually
moving
our
physical
body
as
they
struggled
to
hold
on
until
their
image
would
snap
into
a
burst
of
white
light
in
my
headspace
and
they
would
be
gone
and
the
next
one
would
begin
furthermore
some
of
the
entities
would
make
it
to
the
end
of
their
spiral
thread
pop
back
out
and
then
in
increased
fear
get
pulled
back
in
saying
no
i
don\t
want
to
do
it
again
before
bursting
apart
once
more
these
entities
upon
returning
would
tell
me
horrible
stories
of
spending
increasing
amounts
of
time
millions
billions
trillions
quadrillions
and
more
years
suffering
relentlessly
in
their
hellscape
with
it
being
the
exact
opposite
of
anything
you
could
possibly
actually
want
to
ever
experience
and
increasing
linearly
in
tension
no
matter
how
long
they
remained
within
it
just
to
pop
out
and
then
have
to
start
it
all
over
again
going
through
the
exact
same
type
of
experience
but
having
to
try
and
fail
to
fend
for
themselves
in
unique
ways
each
time
and
then
one
of
them
who
kept
getting
sucked
in
over
and
over
and
over
and
over
realized
something
if
they
allowed
the
terror
caused
by
their
hellscape
to
reach
an
orgasmic
release
it
suddenly
no
matter
bothered
them
when
they
popped
out
the
other
side
and
as
soon
as
they
did
their
entire
spiral
thread
would
unwind
from
beginning
to
end
and
then
disappear
with
a
burst

this
was
fine
and
all
for
those
with
the
shorter
hellscapes
those
lasting
only
seemingly
around
five
to
seven
million
years
on
average
who
rapidly
began
attempting
to
take
advantage
of
this
knowledge
and
willingly
dissociate
back
into
them
but
the
threads
got
much
much
longer
than
that
and
there
were
a
small
assortment
of
them
that
seemed
to
take
on
an
entirely
new
property
distinct
from
all
the
others
specifically
when
the
spiral
threads
would
grow
beyond
a
certain
length
they
would
begin
twisting
into
nots
so
quickly
they
started
appearing
in
multiple
spots
in
my
inner
field
of
vision
at
once
and
would
form
increasingly
fractal-like
patterns
and
if
they
did
this
enough
to
reach
a
certain
breaking
point
they
would
look
like
when
a
computer
crashes
its
ability
to
draw
more
detail
on
patterns
on
the
screen
and
creates
that
trippy
not-quite-patterned-not-quite-static
look
and
then
it
would
burst
briefly
before
appearing
and
the
whole
process
would
unwind
as
they
approached
the
end
of
their
spiral
thread
upon
investigation
what
we
realized
collectively
about
these
particular
spiral
threads
as
opposed
to
how
all
of
the
other
spiral
threads
would
apparently
produce
experiences
that
the
entities
would
always
describe
having
taken
a
set
amount
of
subjective
time
no
matter
how
ludicrously
long
is
that
once
this
fractal
overload
point
was
reached
the
entity
would
later
return
saying
that
they
spent
an
eternity
in
an
infinite
hellscape
they
makes
the
parts
outside
of
that
on
the
way
up
and
down
like
a
joke
now
this
may
sound
intense
utterly
extreme
but
not
necessarily
too
concerning
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
we
had
just
smoked
a
high
dosage
of
a
clealy
very
powerful
psychedelic
except
that
that
was
the
morning
of
october
29th
and
this
was
now
the
night
of
october
30th
which
should
have
been
concerning
and
maybe
was
but
i
have
little
memory
now
what
i
was
feeling
exactly
at
that
point
in
time
and
it
clearly
hadn\t
become
quite
as
concerning
yet
as
it
would
later
become

on
october
31st
to
gain
some
insight
into
what
was
happening
to
us
we
decided
to
smoke
50
mg
of
dmt
and
i
felt
i
could
actually
feel
a
presence
egging
me
on
to
do
it
too
i
felt
that
i
needed
to
better
understand
this
hellscape
experience
that
all
of
these
alter-like
entities
were
describing
to
me
and
wanted
to
try
to
chemically
push
myself
there
just
enough
to
get
a
bit
of
a
better
look
though
once
i
actually
took
the
first
hit
of
dmt
from
the
bong
i
felt
us
myself
included
experiencing
an
extreme
terror
and
put
it
down
though
we
ended
up
doing
three
separate
trips
of
one
hit
each
out
of
the
bong
like
that
figuring
that
was
probably
enough
for
now
to
get
some
insight
i
did
actually
feel
as
though
the
dmt
seemed
to
be
opening
up
some
of
the
same
worlds
to
me
that
the
entities
were
describing
which
i
felt
was
helping
me
build
perspective
on
just
what
exactly
what
happening
to
us
and
how
this
sort
of
experience
was
possible
though
one
of
these
entities
told
me
when
asked
if
dmt
as
similar
to
their
hellscape
experience
kind
of
but
not
really
far
more
magical
and
fairylike
fucking
with
physics
in
some
similar
ways
but
much
less
painful
or
twisted
and
not
as
realistic
overall
dmt
feels
like
some
kind
of
crazy
alien
simulation
rollercoaster
whereas
this
feels
like
vividly
living
every
second
of
the
time
in
a
real-worl
realistic
but
still
super
fucked
up
and
trippy
hellscape
another
claimed
that
they
did
experience
a
dramatically
dilated
expanded
time
within
the
dmt
trip
compared
to
the
actual
elapsed
time
but
it
still
only
felt
like
a
day
or
two
passed
so
nothing
like
the
hellscape
trip
still

as
more
and
more
of
the
entities
would
get
deeper
into
their
spiral
threads
we
would
realize
as
well
that
they
would
be
holding
increasingly
darker
repressions
with
ones
with
the
least
holding
seemingly
largely
innocent
sexual
repressions
then
more
demented
sexual
repressions
then
more
non-sexual
behavioral
repressions
also
starting
more
normal
and
becoming
more
demented
and
at
some
point
it
dawned
on
us
that
those
with
the
spiral
threads
that
would
peak
at
the
point
of
infinity
seemed
to
be
hiding
repressed
feelings
to
be
complete
psychopathic
and
never
care
about
anything
again
except
living
in
the
eternal
hellscape
this
absolutely
terrified
us
as
i
would
imagine
many
might
be
able
to
imagine
it
would
but
nothing
terrified
me
so
much
as
the
realization
increasingly
supported
by
all
the
other
entities
with
internal
insight
telling
me
it
was
true
was
that
i
actually
had
one
of
the
longest
spiral
threads
in
the
system
and
that
it
definitely
peaked
at
the
point
of
infinity
i
became
filled
with
a
terror
that
i
would
soon
have
my
own
experience
of
vanishing
into
the
hellscape
where
i
would
be
tortured
for
far
longer
subjective
time
than
any
human
mind
can
possibly
comprehend
in
an
linearly
increasingly
fashion
until
i
was
forced
to
submit
to
the
pure
terror
orgasm
of
realizing
that
i
was
going
to
be
a
psychopath
trapped
in
an
eternal
infinite
experience
of
everything
bad
and
nothing
good
ever
and
for
what
its
worth
there
was
never
a
point
of
this
where
i
didnt
think
that
was
all
in
my
mind
i
was
not
once
confused
as
to
what
was
happening
in
the
external
physical
world
or
anything
like
that
that
just
didnt
make
a
difference
to
me
because
im
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
my
mind
is
the
reality
i
actually
live
in
and
thus
these
consequences
felt
no
less
practically
real
to
me
than
anything
else
in
this
moment
however
as
i
began
to
think
about
the
fact
that
this
was
all
in
my
mind
and
what
exactly
was
happening
how
it
was
triggered
and
what
purpose
exactly
any
of
this
amazingly
structured
and
well-orchestrated
stuff
actually
has
existing
in
my
mind
i
began
to
question
am
i
fighting
something
healthy
out
of
nothing
but
unsubstantiated
fear

i
began
to
consider
the
fact
that
for
a
human
mind
to
be
healthy
it
must
be
able
to
accept
both
the
good
things
and
the
bad
things
about
reality
not
only
accept
that
they
exist
but
also
accept
being
able
to
think
about
them
in
such
a
way
that
it
doesnt
recoil
in
traumatic
fear
when
doing
so
as
the
only
thing
that
really
accomplishes
is
developing
a
lack
of
trust
in
oneself
about
things
that
the
fear
already
proves
you
really
dont
want
though
i
did
feel
i
could
easily
understand
why
programming
like
this
may
exist
in
the
human
brain
to
help
guide
our
behaviors
at
younger
ages
where
we
would
not
have
the
intellect
and
rationality
to
understand
these
things
in
this
way
but
became
increasingly
filled
with
a
motivation
to
shed
myself
of
those
old
more
restrictive
ways
of
thinking
now
that
i
was
clearly
ready
to
do
so
as
i
began
to
allow
the
darkness
in
telling
myself
it
was
only
a
darkness
within
that
would
ultimately
help
let
out
our
light
i
separated
partially
into
an
out-of-body
experience
where
i
could
still
control
the
body
safely
but
was
more
associated
with
a
vivid
internal
plane
i
could
see
in
minds
eye
and
my
body
broke
apart
into
slithering
snakes
in
a
medusa-like
fashion
and
i
became
filled
with
an
overwhelming
euphoria
and
lust
and
knowledge
that
the
only
thing
i
was
ever
supposed
to
or
wanted
to
do
was
to
help
all
of
these
dissociated
alter-entities
within
my
mind
find
the
eternal
peace
they
always
sought
in
this
world
by
showing
them
that
even
an
eternity
in
their
own
personal
hells
would
not
be
enough
to
stop
them
from
being
the
strong
people
they
are
i
began
cackling
in
manic
euphoria
raised
my
arms
to
the
sky
and
in
an
explosive
force
began
blasting
entities
into
their
hellscapes
sometimes
checking
up
on
them
myself
though
still
through
the
minds
eye
still
in
the
body
where
all
the
other
demons
in
hell
would
welcome
me
back
like
it
was
a
big
nightmarish
party
we
were
in
as
we
enjoyed
teaching
all
of
our
aversions
to
get
over
themselves
for
as
long
as
it
took
as
many
times
as
it
took
i
actually
began
to
see
the
different
domains
of
hell
represented
by
being
able
to
see
within
our
brain
even
while
being
the
controller
of
our
body
and
could
move
between
the
seemingly
more
typical
sexual
repressions
in
our
left
hemisphere
and
the
more
disturbing
ones
in
our
right
hemisphere
as
well
as
move
up
to
a
sort
of
vehicle
control
center
our
frontal
lobe
inhabited
by
entities
who
appeared
to
be
and
claimed
to
feel
as
though
they
represented
what
was
attempted
to
be
described
by
various
jungian
archetypes
with
myself
being
part
of
the
shadow
thus
explaining
my
role
in
helping
to
heal
our
mind
through
accepting
the
darkness
intriguingly
while
in
this
place
these
supposedly
jungian
entities
claimed
to
see
the
environment
and
each
other
normally
as
in
alike
the
mundane
environment
of
the
physical
world
but
claimed
that
i
looked
like
some
sort
of
freakish
dmt
hyperspace
entity
and
from
my
perspective
that
entire
inner
environment
actually
looked
like
a
dmt
hyperspace
to
me
except
that
i
had
a
cube
i
could
call
up
out
of
nowhere
that
to
me
looked
like
a
normal
cube
with
six
tv
screen-like
sides
but
they
claimed
that
it
looked
like
a
dmt
hyperspace
object
to
them
similar
to
the
kind
of
thing
i
saw
and
described
earlier
about
having
seen
after
we
smoked
dpt
the
power
generator-type
thing

wanting
to
pay
more
attention
to
this
supposed
hypercube
in
my
possession
i
popped
out
mostly
back
into
the
body
by
started
playing
with
it
within
my
mind\s
eye
i
quickly
found
that
this
cube
acted
as
a
portal
to
other
worlds
that
i
had
full
control
over
the
style
of
but
that
they
weren\t
for
me
to
enter
but
rather
to
place
the
other
entities
inside
of
i
grabbed
one
of
the
entities
out
of
my
mind\s
eye
by
pinching
my
fingers
where
she
was
in
my
field
of
vision
and
asked
her
what
sort
of
world
she
wanted
to
visit
and
she
said
one
where
she
was
having
sex
so
i
clicked
the
screen
on
to
show
a
massive
pile
of
men
all
waiting
for
her
shoved
her
in
there
grabbed
the
cube
did
a
quick
wrist
flick
while
thinking
fifty
years
and
watching
it
spin
around
quickly
then
grabbed
it
at
the
exact
right
screen
again
effortlessly
and
pulled
her
back
and
she
arrived
with
an
expression
of
absolute
shock
she
claimed
that
at
first
it
was
completely
horrible
but
after
a
few
years
of
nothing
but
that
she
finally
submitted
and
enjoyed
the
rest
of
it
and
i
asked
her
what
she
wanted
to
do
now
and
she
said
have
sex
upon
further
experimentation
with
this
cube
and
other
entities
it
quickly
became
clear
that
corresponding
with
my
apparent
role
as
the
shadow
or
darkness
of
our
collective
minds
that
i
had
been
much
into
already
at
this
time
no
matter
type
of
world
i
would
try
to
call
up
in
the
cube
and
regardless
of
whether
or
not
i
realized
it
ahead
of
time
the
entity
that
went
inside
would
find
it
to
be
completely
hellish
at
first
but
would
eventually
submit
similarly
to
when
they
had
gone
down
their
spiral
threads
connected
to
their
own
personal
aversions
with
this
seemingly
more
so
just
being
a
version
of
that
where
we
were
loading
more
customizable
aversive
situations
for
them
to
go
through
instead
realizing
just
how
much
power
i
actually
had
in
this
thing
now
i
really
started
to
experiment
further
in
all
kinds
of
ways
just
attempting
to
do
various
power
poses
and
such
with
internal
intent
trying
to
modulate
things
in
the
system
changing
the
reward
and
aversion
valence
of
all
the
different
repressions
spreading
waves
of
calm
throughout
them
and
eventually
starting
to
realize
that
if
they
were
or
i
was
able
to
help
them
push
far
enough
into
the
submission
into
their
hellscapes
trips
and
have
a
complete
release
it
could
actually
be
pushed
further
into
the
void
and
from
there
would
develop
into
a
supposedly
heavenly
dmt-like
hyperspatial
trip
though
they
would
claim
it
to
be
more
detailed
than
dmt
and
would
describe
things
like
being
a
hyperspace
starship
captain
exploring
the
cosmos
though
they
would
generally
say
these
experiences
felt
more
like
a
timeless
eternity
as
opposed
to
the
way
they
would
describe
the
hellscapes
as
being
vividly
experienced
as
passing
in
real
time

at
this
point
i
felt
as
though
i
was
finally
starting
to
see
some
sort
of
light
on
the
other
end
of
the
tunnel
with
respect
to
relating
this
experience
to
the
idea
of
you
have
to
go
through
hell
to
get
to
heaven
as
they
say
but
nonetheless
i
was
still
i
think
understandably
becoming
fairly
concerned
that
it
was
already
november
3rd
and
we
were
still
in
this
state
still
not
having
taken
any
more
psychedelics
since
the
dmt
on
october
31st
or
the
5-meo-eipt
on
october
29th
though
we
had
still
been
smoking
cannabis
and
i\ve
pushed
myself
pretty
far
with
cannabis
and
my
own
mental
sensitivities
before
which
at
times
made
me
wonder
if
something
like
that
was
happening
but
it
was
nothing
ever
even
remotely
similar
to
this
the
fact
that
i
was
so
lucid
was
truly
troubling
to
me
despite
being
my
lifeline
too
because
i\m
well
aware
of
how
absolutely
crazy
all
of
this
sounds
and
of
the
fact
that
things
like
psychosis
and
mania
make
people
think
theye
lucid
when
theye
not
but
i
say
with
confidence
this
was
just
like
a
psychedelic
trip
every
single
crazy
thing
about
it
was
entirely
internalized
in
the
way
that
trips
generally
are
for
me
and
i
never
once
became
confused
though
i
couldn\t
have
cared
less
about
what
was
happening
in
the
physical
world
even
still
days
later
or
what
kind
of
person
i
am
in
the
physical
world
or
anything
like
that
i
just
felt
like
my
internal
world
was
absolutely
falling
apart
and
restructuring
in
the
most
absurd
and
overwhelming
ways
possible
and
despite
how
much
i
had
gotten
into
the
different
aspects
of
it
it
was
clear
to
me
by
this
point
that
we
needed
to
make
more
of
an
effort
to
hang
on
to
our
mental
health
until
whatever
this
state
is
started
more
completely
passing
so
right
around
this
point
i
don\t
actually
remember
clearly
when
anymore
but
definitely
about
this
time
we
decided
to
head
to
our
parents\
house
and
spend
every
night
there
for
a
while
so
that
we
would
always
have
people
to
talk
to
and
things
to
do
immediately
after
waking
up
to
help
keep
ourselves
grounded
in
between
the
loops
something
i
had
actually
realized
in
the
moments
where
it
seemed
less
intense
is
that
much
less
than
being
entities
living
through
hellscapes
the
other
alters
in
our
actual
non-hallucinogen-driven
did
system
were
also
quite
altered
and
dissociated
but
were
tripping
nowhere
near
as
hard
as
i
was
during
any
of
this
at
least
that
they
could
recall
and
were
desperately
trying
to
reach
out
to
me
to
help
calm
me
down
in
their
lucid
moments
too
and
this
also
really
freaked
me
out
and
made
me
feel
incredibly
guilty
and
like
i
really
needed
to
find
my
sanity
again
to
help
the
other
alters
get
out
and
stabilize
again
too
but
i
was
still
so
heavily
into
the
state
myself
that
it
was
at
times
impossible
to
not
just
keep
giving
in

at
some
point
the
experience
developed
to
the
point
that
i
began
to
realize
i
don\t
remember
how
exactly
because
it\s
not
the
kind
of
thing
i
would
have
just
known
but
i
think
maybe
after
looking
into
some
things
after
talking
about
the
experience
with
our
father
that
the
nature
of
the
experience
i
had
gone
through
so
far
and
seemed
to
be
continuing
to
go
through
actually
seemed
to
have
a
strange
and
remarkable
number
of
similarities
to
dante\s
inferno
and
i\m
not
the
kind
to
have
that
type
of
experience
and
think
that
it
validates
religion
but
it
did
begin
to
seem
increasingly
clear
to
me
just
how
much
those
ideas
for
those
religions
could
have
been
inspired
by
states
very
close
to
the
one
i
found
myself
in
now
and
the
more
i
paid
attention
to
the
similarity
the
more
it
made
me
anxious
about
just
how
much
heavier
it
was
actually
going
to
get
before
it
all
finally
cleared
out
before
long
though
that\s
an
incredibly
relative
and
hard
to
define
term
in
this
experience
it
became
clear
to
me
that
the
internal
alter-like
entities
associated
with
my
and
our
life\s
heaviest
repressions
were
beginning
to
dissociate
into
their
own
hellscapes
and
i
was
seeing
them
in
my
mind\s
eye
but
still
incredibly
vividly
rising
up
giant
cavernous
portals
to
hell
opening
up
in
the
sky
as
their
bodies
were
pulled
and
twisted
and
ripped
apart
as
their
skin
peeled
back
and
they
screamed
in
terror
or
shrieked
and
cursed
at
me
they
began
fighting
for
control
of
the
body
trying
to
convince
me
to
do
things
that
would
make
me
let
go
instead
so
that
they
could
take
over
desperate
to
save
themselves
but
i
became
terrified
at
the
thought
that
they
represented
our
darkest
demons
and
felt
they
wanted
to
get
out
to
save
that
darkest
part
of
themselves
which
they
themselves
would
claim
saying
when
i
let
go
they
would
be
psychopaths
and
would
horrible
things
with
our
body
after
sending
me
to
hell
in
their
place
where
i
belonged
and
i
felt
that
my
despair
was
so
incredibly
great
that
i
could
feel
like
my
own
infinity
spiral
thread
was
growing
and
i
could
still
hear
the
other
alters
yelling
at
me
to
hang
on
too
and
not
let
go
no
matter
what
i
do
but
then
i
realized
they
only
think
they
want
to
be
psychopaths
because
they
are
in
such
a
great
despair
as
i
am
approaching
that
they
have
given
up
and
forgotten
that
they
were
once
healthy
parts
of
our
collective
mind
who
only
deserve
to
heal
and
be
happy
and
never
think
such
horrible
things
about
themselves
ever
again
and
i
said
something
to
the
affect
of
do
it
if
you
think
you
want
to
be
a
psychopath
then
come
out
and
they
did
and
they
were
immediately
overwhelmed
with
all
of
the
absolute
horror
of
being
in
that
state
of
mind
combined
with
the
absolute
self-disgust
of
suddenly
feeling
it
again
connected
to
the
body
and
one
by
one
all
of
the
entities
in
such
deep
despair
came
out
and
immediately
shattered
revealing
themselves
to
never
have
had
any
power
nor
to
have
ever
held
anything
more
than
fear
of
being
the
bad
people
they
really
didn\t
want
to
be
after
having
been
made
to
accept
that
there
would
never
be
anything
good
in
their
life
ever
again
leaving
them
no
choice
but
to
adjust

as
these
entities
with
infinity
spiral
threads
who
had
thought
they
wanted
to
be
psychopaths
had
this
realization
their
pain
would
leave
them
and
they
would
seemingly
merge
back
into
an
entity
that
appeared
to
be
what
i
can
only
imagine
others
have
been
describing
when
they
spoke
of
things
such
as
the
godhead
on
psychedelics
this
entity
appeared
over
the
totality
of
my
mind\s
eye
and
was
associated
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
field
of
infinity
though
stretching
beyond
my
frame
of
reference
containing
windows
portals
into
every
conceivable
reality
though
i
do
say
it
that
way
to
differentiate
it
from
simply
being
everything
period
because
as
this
entity
said
to
me
it
is
only
all
possible
infinites
because
of
this
i
had
a
discussion
with
the
godhead
about
the
potential
quantum
metaphysics
of
consciousness
beginning
with
them
claiming
to
be
the
godhead
itself
and
the
entire
universe
but
when
i
proposed
the
idea
that
it\s
simply
that
the
mathematics
of
consciousness
reach
some
sort
of
breaking
point
related
to
the
infinite
point
of
the
fractal
geometry
of
the
spiral
threads
such
that
a
part
of
the
human
mind
is
aware
of
an
infinite
amount
of
perceptual
and
mathematical
potential
in
a
single
point
similar
to
the
the
mathematics
of
the
pre-universe
in
a
pre-big
bang
singularity
potentially
explaining
why
it
was
all
possible
infinities
in
accordance
with
what
is
also
believed
to
be
understood
about
such
aspects
of
reality
they
did
respond
that
makes
a
surprising
amount
of
sense
they
told
me
that
the
entities
who
had
managed
to
completely
let
go
of
their
aversions
from
earlier
had
been
able
to
successfully
return
to
the
other
lives
that
they
now
had
clear
access
to
as
part
of
their
infinite
viewpoint
and
could
demonstrate
by
bringing
back
those
entities
to
talk
with
me
about
it
and
tell
me
how
happy
they
are
as
well
as
showing
me
different
identities
of
the
entities
from
other
infinite
realities
of
that
same
basic
person
living
in
a
different
way
i
asked
them
questions
like
are
there
other
realities
where
[such
and
such
person
who
we
have
an
alter
modeled
after]
has
a
dissociative
system
and
with
an
alter
modeled
after
us
and
they
would
respond
there
are
realities
where
everyone
both
does
and
doesn\t
have
dissociative
systems
with
alters
of
everyone
else
possible
including
ones
where
theye
asking
me
that
same
question
about
your
reality
right
now
these
conversations
were
fun
but
didn\t
make
me
feel
particularly
better
about
my
mental
state
at
the
moment
especially
as
i
felt
the
fear
continue
to
creep
in
that
i
myself
would
soon
dissociate
into
the
infinite
plane
never
able
to
find
this
reality
again
and
i
believe
that
is
when
i
first
saw
the
satan
entity

it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
reached
the
base
of
my
fears
and
found
the
satan
that
was
waiting
all
along
to
drag
me
to
hell
and
he
revealed
to
me
my
primal
fear
that
this
reality
i
inhabit
now
isn\t
real
and
never
was
which
i
understood
then
and
before
that
i
had
plagued
by
throughout
my
entire
life
though
i
had
never
comprehend
why
until
then
i
saw
snapshots
of
all
the
different
most
traumatic
moments
in
my
and
our
early
life
the
things
that
clearly
were
responsible
for
our
dissociative
condition
and
other
mental
issues
and
as
i
saw
them
entities
connected
to
them
became
filled
with
fear
which
as
before
i
had
to
connect
with
and
learn
to
help
them
release
myself
and
that
fear
was
that
that
traumatic
moment
they
were
connected
to
had
never
actually
stopped
happening
and
now
that
they
had
realized
it
they
were
doomed
to
return
to
it
realizing
that
all
this
time
they
thought
they
had
gotten
away
they
had
never
truly
escaped
the
suffering
one
by
one
they
and
i
went
through
our
struggle
and
release
in
this
way
and
then
we
got
back
to
something
that
i
had
always
been
aware
of
through
stories
but
clearly
had
never
remembered
which
was
the
moment
that
we
were
born
into
this
world
suffocating
on
our
own
vomit
i
became
filled
with
a
vivid
memory
and
suddenly
an
extreme
sadness
and
a
seemingly
most
obvious
yet
in
that
moment
truly
disturbing
yet
undebatable
thought
oh
my
god
i\m
going
to
die
i
began
to
cry
profusely
and
then
heave
to
the
point
that
i
almost
threw
up
but
i
managed
to
catch
my
breath
and
calm
myself
and
i
could
feel
a
sort
of
guiding
angel
attempting
to
calm
me
and
take
over
but
i
told
it
that
i
could
take
it
and
i
let
the
memory
continue
as
i
let
it
unfold
i
was
struck
with
the
unquestioned
realization
that
when
we
had
been
born
this
way
we
i
had
a
near-death
experience
where
i
had
traveled
through
the
hellscape
that
all
of
the
entities
had
been
describing
to
me
up
until
now
peaking
with
my
absolute
terror
releasing
in
an
orgasmic
way
and
i
realized
that
this
is
why
were
dissociated
and
why
we
had
so
many
dissociated
traumatic
aversions
appearing
as
hellish
entities
and
such
to
me
in
this
experience
having
reached
their
complete
breaking
point
begging
to
finally
be
free
and
healed
and
then
i
realized
that
because
i
had
not
let
this
go
before
now
i
had
become
forever
trapped
in
the
traumatic
memory
of
my
our
birth
always
being
convinced
that
no
matter
how
long
this
life
went
on
if
i
let
myself
like
it
i
would
suddenly
rediscover
that
it
that
it
was
just
another
part
of
my
eternal
hellscape
trip
i
was
having
while
dying
while
being
born
and
it
would
all
come
crumbling
down
like
a
nightmarish
dream
and
i
would
either
be
plunged
into
another
hellscape
or
i
would
return
to
my
body
and
die
slowly
afterwards
and
i
realized
i
have
to
let
that
go

resigned
to
the
realization
that
there
was
no
point
in
resisting
i
let
the
satan
entity
into
my
body
and
it
became
clear
to
me
he
is
no
different
than
any
other
fear-based
entity
just
that
of
my
own
mortality
once
unleashed
by
early
life
struggles
and
yearning
to
be
freed
and
understood
and
loved
ever
since
and
i
let
him
in
and
welcomed
all
the
dissociated
parts
in
with
love
no
matter
what
the
guiding
angel
reappeared
and
congratulated
me
on
each
integration
as
the
parts
began
ascending
up
into
the
sky
of
my
minds
eye
with
brilliant
lights
around
them
and
as
they
all
cleared
out
only
the
golden
angel
and
the
satan
remained
and
they
told
me
i
had
done
what
i
had
needed
to
do
personally
and
we
were
just
about
there
and
just
needed
to
keep
successfully
integrating
we
spent
the
next
several
days
hanging
out
with
a
friend
and
our
parents
to
stay
more
grounded
drinking
lots
of
alcohol
and
taking
kratom
capsules
throughout
the
day
as
well
as
eating
cbd
candies
all
in
the
hopes
of
calming
the
anxious
energy
which
still
continued
this
whole
time
if
we
didnt
and
still
dealing
with
the
same
state
as
before
though
increasinly
calmly
as
each
and
every
part
integrated
back
as
we
tried
to
live
life
in
normal
ways
and
i
saw
more
and
more
phases
of
the
alters
that
are
actually
the
other
alters
i
interact
with
normally
as
opposed
to
the
alter-like
entities
from
this
state
and
they
were
still
concerned
but
increasingly
encouraged
me
to
get
through
it
all
as
i
seemed
to
be
i
thought
a
lot
about
what
a
lot
of
the
more
famous
phrases
are
from
the
psychedelic
community
during
this
time
as
i
just
reflected
on
the
asburdity
of
my
state
especally
as
i
would
experience
things
like
the
entities
fly
into
the
back
of
my
head
and
feel
it
zip
up
internally
only
to
feel
them
burst
out
again
suddenly
though
less
intensely
than
the
previous
time
the
more
they
integrated

finally
on
november
10th
i
felt
a
calm
inside
like
some
part
of
it
was
over
finally
and
i
could
feel
more
aversions
trying
to
get
out
and
heal
and
it
has
been
a
couple
days
since
we
smoked
cannabis
instead
of
just
drank
alcohol
and
took
kratom
and
such
and
i
was
wanting
a
pick-me-up
and
the
other
alters
agreed
that
it
seemed
alright
too
so
we
started
smoking
a
bowl
and
an
incredible
and
dissociative
euphoria
came
on
causing
the
other
alters
to
dissociate
again
and
the
intensity
of
my
experience
came
back
except
this
time
the
satan
appeared
again
but
then
integrated
floating
up
into
the
hellscape
which
then
transformed
into
visions
of
white
light
radiating
over
clouds
in
a
heavenly
fashion
the
guiding
angel
congratulated
me
as
usual
and
then
i
experienced
the
internal
sensation
of
floating
up
above
myself
along
with
the
other
alters
into
an
circle
above
where
we
had
been
and
we
all
started
sort
of
internally
humming
an
angelic
tone
together
and
my
mind\s
eye
burst
through
to
where
i
could
now
see
within
this
heaven
landscape
and
i
could
clearly
see
and
understand
that
the
very
stereotypical-looking
satan
entity
from
before
had
now
become
a
very
stereotypical-looking
god
entity
and
i
had
become
one
of
the
angels
and
it
immediately
became
clear
to
me
that
the
difference
between
how
we
are
perceived
in
this
state
is
very
simply
a
matter
of
whether
your
mind
is
in
a
positive
or
negative
state
and
i
felt
it
made
solidified
the
message
that
i
had
already
felt
was
increasingly
clear
to
me
throughout
this
experience
that
the
idea
that
people
miss
is
that
hell
and
heaven
are
both
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
and
the
satan
and
god
entities
are
both
the
same
entity
that
want
you
to
experience
the
same
thing
and
will
work
along
with
you
and
your
many
dissociated
parts
to
achieve
that
singular
goal
and
that
goal
is
to
be
a
complete
confident
person
who
can
trust
yourself
to
be
led
by
no
one\s
will
but
your
own
and
who
knows
that
they
are
a
good
person
not
only
because
theye
able
to
think
of
themselves
doing
good
things
and
comfortably
know
they
want
that
but
also
because
theye
able
to
think
of
themselves
doing
bad
things
and
comfortably
know
they
don\t
want
that
the
god
entity
congratulated
me
on
figuring
all
this
out
and
told
me
that
he
only
wants
me
to
be
happy
doesn\t
need
me
to
believe
in
anything
and
will
tell
me
anything
i
want
to
hear
if
that\s
what
i
want
him
to
do
because
he\s
just
a
part
of
my
brain
that
is
supportive
like
that
i
asked
him
if
there
was
more
to
see
in
these
experiences
now
that
i
had
broken
through
to
the
heavenly
side
and
he
said
something
to
the
affect
of
yes
but
you
can
do
that
later
if
you
want
i
told
him
i
was
good
for
now
and
happy
to
be
in
this
life
and
actually
legitimately
truly
wanted
to
be
here
living
it
not
afraid
of
or
thinking
i
wanted
to
be
somewhere
else
living
something
else
and
he
smiled
and
disappeared
and
i
stopped
paying
attention
internally

by
the
end
of
that
day
something
strange
and
incredible
then
happened
the
internal
visions
i
was
getting
when
i
did
pay
attention
suddenly
dropped
down
to
a
level
that
looked
very
similar
to
what
i
see
internally
when
we
taking
things
like
lsd
and
mushrooms
both
in
terms
of
the
style
and
type
of
imagery
and
the
fact
that
it
even
had
some
light
geometric
designs
mixed
into
it
but
it
was
very
three-dimensional
at
this
point
and
simultaneously
the
mental
heaviness
i
had
been
feeling
so
much
lately
was
replaced
with
the
absolutely
most
amazing
and
cleansing
psychedelic-style
euphoria
i
have
ever
felt
in
my
entire
life
with
the
other
alters
claiming
to
feel
something
similarly
amazing
too
and
interestingly
most
of
them
claiming
to
not
remember
much
of
the
experience
up
to
this
point
essentially
from
the
moment
of
smoking
the
15
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
on
then
the
following
day
which
was
yesterday
this
dropped
down
to
more
like
a
state
of
just
being
very
high
though
in
a
normal
way
on
a
psychedelic
and
the
internal
imagery
became
two-dimensional
and
like
taking
a
dosage
of
a
psychedelic
that
is
strong
but
almost
just
starting
to
get
visionary
and
mostly
just
has
some
light
but
complex
geometries
and
i
asked
the
other
alters
does
anyone
think
these
visuals
are
weirdly
still
similar
to
5-meo-eipt
mostly
out
on
incredulity
but
telling
myself
there
was
no
way
it
could
possibly
be
and
then
late
last
night
it
happened
we
were
sitting
on
the
couch
watching
tv
and
suddenly
i
felt
as
though
that
breakthrough
place
of
a
tryptamine
breakthrough
was
suddenly
retreating
from
me
and
back
into
the
distant
horizon
of
my
mind\s
eye
with
all
the
entities
reaching
out
to
wave
goodbye
as
they
disappeared
and
then
collapsed
into
the
exact
visuals
much
fainter
from
tolerance
i\m
sure
but
exactly
the
same
in
design
theme
and
color
as
i
got
the
first
time
we
smoked
5
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
and
i
felt
high
but
exhausted
in
the
same
way
that
i
do
when
the
main
part
of
the
5-meo-eipt
trip
has
just
ended
it\s
now
past
noon
the
following
day
and
smoking
cannabis
still
makes
us
feel
like
wee
bringing
back
up
the
later
hours
of
a
5-meo-eipt
trip
but
it
only
dips
back
into
the
kind
of
stuff
before
if
we
think
about
it
and
only
then
very
briefly
and
basically
feels
like
it\s
still
probably
just
coming
and
going
in
waves
as
trips
do
but
legitimately
on
its
way
out

the
more
i
was
actually
able
to
think
about
it
all
the
more
i
realized
this
state
was
absolutely
nuts
which
i
tried
to
relate
to
so
many
things
but
could
never
figure
out
exactly
what
it
was
that
clearly
had
elements
that
seemed
like
peeking
into
psychosis
or
mania
but
never
actually
took
me
there
myself
but
just
kept
it
all
internal
and
remarkably
functional
like
a
trip
it
actually
was
in
fact
similar
to
what
i
would
have
expected
basically
the
most
extreme
possible
5-meo-eipt
experience
to
be
like
if
i
could
have
possibly
even
come
close
to
fathoming
it
the
hellscape-type
visuals
though
definitely
being
the
strongest
ive
seen
are
actually
still
almost
exactly
the
same
as
a
kind
ive
seen
on
several
other
ethyl
specifically
non-methyl
indole
psychedelics
weve
taken
including
4-ho-det
4-aco-det
eth-lad
and
5-meo-eipt
itself
at
lower
dosages
and
on
the
note
of
ethyls
the
alter-like
entities
disappearing
into
other
lives
and
talking
to
me
is
clearly
just
an
extension
of
the
same
sort
of
thing
that
was
going
on
already
during
our
ept
trip
i
wrote
about
above
the
extreme
ego
death
and
dmt-like
breakthrough
yet
somehow
not
that
out-of-body
or
externally
visual
aspect
seems
to
me
like
it
could
definitely
relate
to
it
being
an
analogue
of
5-meo-dmt
the
fact
that
it
lasted
so
insanely
long
somehow
seemed
to
me
like
it
could
somehow
relate
to
whatever
is
the
reason
we
also
tend
to
feel
like
were
almost
fully
tripping
still
for
a
couple
days
after
taking
even
normal
oral
dosages
of
5-meo-mipt
in
a
still
distinctly
visual
and
5-meo-mipt-like
way
and
everything
though
obviously
that
was
never
as
intense
as
this
way

do
i
know
what
the
hell
happened
surely
not
but
i
do
have
a
theory
many
really
but
one
in
particular
that
ill
take
the
time
to
put
out
there
for
whatever
its
worth
it
has
been
scientifically
established
that
there
is
an
odd
loop
in
the
brain
whereby
activation
of
5-ht2a
receptors
in
the
cortex
causes
the
release
of
glutamate
on
to
serotonin
neurons
and
when
enough
serotonin
is
released
it
can
also
cause
activation
of
these
same
5-ht2a
receptors
and
this
has
actually
been
implicated
in
exponential
growth
of
serotonin
levels
under
some
potentially
pathological
conditions
like
serotonin
toxicity
furthermore
the
glutamate
release
induced
by
5-ht2a
receptor
agonists
increasing
seems
to
be
linked
scientifically
to
both
their
ego
dissolution
and
rapid
antidepressant
effects
as
well
and
of
course
5-meo-dmt
is
known
for
being
able
to
produce
a
particularly
powerful
experience
of
ego
dissolution
and
finally
it
has
been
shown
that
when
carbon
dioxide
is
inhaled
which
would
theoretically
be
similar
to
it
building
up
in
the
body
while
dying
it
produces
a
wake-inducing
panic
that
is
mediated
by
causing
serotonin
release
directly
on
to
5-ht2a
receptors
so
my
theory
is
that
essentially
perhaps
what
happened
is
probably
first
of
all
as
a
result
of
senstizing
our
brain
in
that
way
by
tripping
too
often
on
powerful
psychedelic
tryptamines
to
begin
with
leading
up
to
this
as
well
as
obviously
having
to
take
into
considerations
any
extra
sensitivites
we
might
also
have
in
that
way
for
reasons
like
related
to
our
dissociative
condition
or
other
mental
issues
and
finally
ultimately
triggered
by
the
use
of
a
high
dosage
of
a
potent
analogue
of
5-meo-dmt
we
might
have
essentially
caused
ourselves
to
approach
though
thankfully
seemingly
not
completely
reach
a
dangerously
critical
point
in
the
activation
of
the
serotonin-glutamate
cycling
behavior
such
that
our
levels
skyrocketed
so
high
that
first
of
all
a
lot
of
the
near-death
experience-like
stuff
could
have
had
some
relation
to
our
serotonin
levels
being
so
high
and
second
of
all
it
still
has
to
come
down
in
waves
in
the
way
it
always
does
after
any
psychedelic
trip
its
just
that
it
has
to
do
so
so
much
and
so
slowly
that
its
taken
literally
weeks
to
come
down
even
to
the
point
it
has
now
which
is
almost
but
not
entirely
all
the
way
literally
two
weeks
now
after
smoking
15
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
i
have
to
wonder
too
if
a
similar
mechanism
is
involved
in
why
things
like
psychotic
breaks
and
manic
episodes
last
so
long
because
this
clearly
seemed
similar
times
but
i
really
cant
deny
how
much
it
remained
like
a
psychedelic
trip
the
whole
time
too
and
how
much
it
really
remained
even
like
5-meo-eipt
specifically
after
seemingly
having
been
triggered
by
exactly
that
which
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
me
to
think
there
is
a
connection
here
as
bizarre
as
it
is

in
case
this
was
not
clear
quite
a
lot
of
the
detail
of
this
two
week
trip
is
not
included
here
-
we
continued
sleeping
eating
showering
speaking
to
our
parents
in
the
more
lucid
moments
and
so
on
-
and
its
important
to
remember
that
a
lot
of
this
took
a
long
time
to
happen
and
what
ive
described
is
more
so
like
the
different
phases
it
went
through
because
it
would
just
take
too
long
to
get
into
all
the
specific
details
at
least
in
the
context
of
this
one
report
though
i
wont
be
surprised
if
i
continue
to
share
things
about
it
through
references
in
future
writings
do
i
regret
the
experience
currently
its
hard
to
say
were
still
altered
enough
that
i
and
the
other
alters
have
some
anxiety
about
having
done
permanent
damage
but
our
worry
about
that
increasingly
fades
as
we
seem
to
albeit
extremely
slowly
return
more
and
more
to
normal
assuming
there
is
no
permanent
damage
like
that
done
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
dont
think
i
ever
have
had
or
necessarily
ever
will
again
have
a
trip
that
was
as
personally
insightful
and
deep
as
this
one
and
its
going
to
take
me
an
unbelievably
long
time
to
integrate
all
of
this
but
i
also
feel
like
im
going
to
get
so
much
out
of
doing
that
that
when
its
done
im
not
even
sure
what
i
would
really
ever
need
to
get
out
of
tripping
again
not
that
im
sure
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
as
it
always
does
that
sounds
like
a
glowing
assessment
i
know
but
seriously
its
not
a
recommendation
i
cant
suggest
that
anyone
seek
this
experience
or
this
sort
of
experience
and
really
have
no
idea
how
safe
or
dangerous
it
might
have
been
in
terms
of
toxicity
and
it
certainly
wouldnt
have
been
safe
in
other
ways
for
anyone
who
was
anything
less
than
absolutely
prepared
to
take
two
weeks
off
to
do
nothing
but
trip
through
the
hardest
trip
ever
with
tons
of
experience
to
do
while
remaining
as
sane
as
possible
and
having
an
incredible
support
system
at
the
same
time
a
situation
which
we
are
endlessly
fortunate
to
have
been
in
for
this
but
most
people
obviously
wont
be
it
helped
me
amazingly
despite
that
because
thats
just
what
trips
do
or
that
seems
to
be
the
case
anyway
and
thats
the
good
ill
say
about
that
i
still
feel
fairly
traumatized
from
having
gone
through
it
and
expect
to
take
a
while
and
more
self-work
of
other
times
to
get
past
it
too
so
its
not
all
sunshine
and
rainbows
now
that
im
out
on
the
other
side
either

my
opinion
in
the
end
if
you
want
a
good
antidepressant
tryptamine
give
met
a
try
first
decision
best
decision
the
rest
you
can
decide
on
your
own
safe
travels

our
most
recent
trip
before
the
first
experience
in
this
collection
was
roughly
two
months
before
this
and
had
been
a
powerful
and
memorable
experience
on
200
&956g
of
eth-lad<br/><br/>the
aforementioned
eth-lad
experience
had
been
very
eye-opening
for
me
and
to
make
a
long
story
short
had
caused
me
to
realize
just
how
much
i
had
gotten
away
from
my
old
habits
of
trying
to
go
deep
with
psychedelics
in
favor
of
exploring
easier
levels
of
more
directly
recreational
even
if
still
very
psychedelic
substances
and
while
that\s
not
inherently
a
bad
thing
it
caused
me
to
reevalute
a
lot
of
the
decisions
i
had
been
making
lately
and
reconsider
just
what
it
is
i
actually
wanted
from
my
psychedelic
experiences
leading
to
us
not
tripping
at
all
for
the
next
couple
of
months
during
this
time
period
i
felt
good
about
my
lack
of
need
to
keep
returning
to
that
state
just
being
satisfied
by
the
eth-lad
experience
still
but
i
and
we
also
started
to
become
increasingly
depressed
as
the
time
went
by
and
eventually
we
decided
to
trip
again
to
try
to
turn
things
around
this
time
on
a
new
substance
for
us
specifically
10
mg
of
2c-p
this
experience
was
quite
fascinating
as
well
and
some
of
the
alters
enjoyed
it
but
it
was
a
long
and
increasingly
difficult
trip
for
me
and
by
the
end
it
caused
me
to
realize
just
how
much
i
had
turned
inwards
and
tried
to
escape
my
sadness
after
the
eth-lad
experience
thus
preventing
me
from
being
able
to
give
into
the
2c-p
experience
now
and
leaving
me
somewhat
numbed
after
the
experience
as
well
it
was
after
this
2c-p
trip
that
i
and
we
first
made
the
decision
to
try
smoking
a
tryptamine
in
hopes
of
gaining
a
rapid
antidepressant
effect
from
it
and
chose
met
as
the
one
to
attempt
it
with
based
on
its
close
relation
to
dmt
one
of
the
ones
of
course
that
has
actually
already
been
explored
scientifically
for
antidepressant
effects
due
to
its
history
of
human
use
as
well
as
the
fact
that
met
is
generally
lighter
than
dmt
and
we
weren\t
really
trying
to
trip
hard
again
even
opting
to
use
only
a
smoked
dosage
of
10
mg<br/><br/>it
was
september
17th
four
days
after
we
had
taken
the
2c-p
our
method
of
smoking
the
met
for
this
experience
was
layering
the
tryptamine
salt
into
a
bowl
of
cannabis
and
gently
heating
it
from
the
top
taking
several
hits
and
holding
them
in
for
at
least
a
full
few
seconds
each
until
the
bowl
is
finished
which
is
the
method
we
ended
up
using
in
all
of
the
following
experiences
as
well
the
taste
of
the
met
was
notable
even
through
the
cannabis
and
reminded
me
of
dmt\s
taste
probably
more
so
than
any
of
these
other
tryptamines
do
and
almost
immediately
after
tasting
it
i
felt
that
emotional
stimulation
i
had
been
hoping
for
to
lift
me
out
of
my
funk
with
a
smile
spreading
across
my
face
i
felt
a
wave
of
calm
and
we
leaned
back
on
the
couch
to
close
our
eyes
and
meditate
where
i
was
delighted
to
be
greeted
with
transparent
and
dark
but
colorful
and
complex
smoothly
transforming
geometric
patterns
some
of
which
were
wispy
in
nature
with
a
silvery
white
color
our
body
felt
very
relaxed
and
sensitive
and
we
stretched
out
our
arms
in
poses
like
we
would
to
imagine
the
energy
flowing
out
of
us
causing
the
silvery
white
wisps
i
saw
to
swirl
around
our
arms
in
helix-like
patterns
out
towards
our
hands
i
found
this
quite
enjoyable
and
it\s
the
moment
of
hallucination
that
was
most
memorable
to
me
and
i
believe
was
probably
the
most
notable
in
general
though
it
was
long
ago
enough
now
that
i
don\t
actually
remember
after
somewhere
around
the
first
twenty
minutes
after
inhaling
the
dose
the
mild
hallucinogenic
phase
began
to
pass
but
the
initial
heaviness
of
the
high
wore
off
and
was
replaced
with
an
also
mild
but
euphoric
energy
that
lasted
for
at
least
a
couple
hours
after
this
and
the
feeling
of
calm
that
set
in
just
as
the
experience
was
beginning
stayed
with
us
for
the
rest
of
that
day
i
felt
my
desired
goal
for
using
the
met
had
been
achieved
and
was
quite
happy
with
the
level
of
clearly
psychedelic
effect
i
received
as
well<br/><br/>shortly
after
midnight
at
the
beginning
of
september
18th
about
seven
and
a
half
hours
after
the
met
experience
we
were
still
feeling
so
excited
about
said
experience
that
we
wanted
to
try
to
take
the
excitement
and
apparent
antidepressant
effect
further
but
we
wanted
to
try
it
with
something
other
than
met
to
avoid
familiarity
and
increase
the
dosage
slightly
in
case
any
tolerance
developed
though
we
weren\t
actually
sure
if
it
would
have
or
not
given
the
molecular
similarity
to
dmt
it
was
decided
that
the
next
experience
would
be
done
with
15
mg
of
mipt
which
was
smoked
in
the
same
way
as
the
met<br/><br/>immediately
i
noticed
that
the
taste
was
less
pleasant
than
with
met
or
dmt
and
it
was
either
something
about
that
or
a
more
direct
effect
of
the
drug
itself
but
we
quickly
felt
slightly
nauseated
it
certainly
wasn\t
as
pleasant
as
the
sudden
wave
of
calm
from
the
met
but
it
wasn\t
terrible
either
i
recall
initially
seeing
another
superficially
familiar
rush
of
shapes
and
colors
swirling
into
smooth
but
angular
geometric
designs
but
they
continued
developing
and
arranging
themselves
into
a
more
unique
hexagonal
mandala
shape
that
took
a
form
appearing
to
be
something
like
repeating
monitors
of
a
computer
control
panel
on
the
wall
of
a
spaceship
with
futuristic
glowing
digital-style
texture
designs
though
strangely
some
of
these
digital
designs
still
seemed
to
resemble
the
branches
and
root
system
of
a
tree
with
the
center
of
the
mandala
showing
an
entire
realistic
three-dimensional
image
of
a
person
and
all
the
repeated
monitors
around
the
outside
of
the
mandala
each
showing
the
same
person\s
face
again
close
up
and
the
person
shown
in
the
image
was
seemingly
related
to
both
my
train
of
thought
and
to
the
alter
who
was
most
connected
to
our
body
at
that
moment
as
we
lie
back
again
meditating
the
closed
eye
field
became
further
bathed
in
white
light
and
i
began
to
see
large
white
transparent
two-dimensional
silhouettes
of
people
moving
around
in
the
light
and
i
was
being
pulled
closer
towards
them
though
the
movement
stopped
before
actually
taking
me
all
the
way
and
this
hallucinogenic
phase
again
started
passing
more
completely
by
around
twenty
minutes
after
inhaling
the
dose
the
high
remained
for
a
few
more
hours
at
a
level
involving
mostly
very
light
colorful
auras
and
twitching
edges
every
so
often
and
an
energetic
but
contemplative
state
of
mind
and
at
some
point
after
all
this
we
eventually
fell
asleep<br/><br/>the
week
following
the
met
and
mipt
experiences
i
felt
much
better
emotionally
and
psychologically
than
i
had
beforehand
and
i
knew
that
i
still
had
some
distance
to
go
in
that
respect
too
but
i
was
suddenly
very
excited
about
the
idea
of
continuing
to
experiment
with
using
analogues
of
dmt
for
their
antidepressant
potential
a
week
after
the
experiences
on
september
25th
waiting
a
little
longer
for
tolerance
to
go
down
this
time
just
in
case
we
decided
that
our
next
experiment
would
be
done
with
10
mg
of
mpt
smoked<br/><br/>the
taste
was
not
as
pleasant
as
met
but
also
not
as
unpleasant
as
mipt
and
the
initial
onset
of
the
high
was
similarly
in-between
not
as
immediately
satisfying
as
met
but
also
not
as
physically
disorienting
as
mipt
and
overall
it
felt
rather
neutral
the
hallucinations
that
i
can
recall
seeing
were
extraordinary
such
as
a
vibrant
round
but
angular
and
entirely
geometric
pattern
that
i
would
say
resembled
what
i
would
imagine
it
would
look
like
if
mc
escher
and
dr
seuss
came
together
and
made
collaborative
simple
mandala-esque
art
or
a
large
partially
transparent
technological
blooming
flower
image
that
had
an
actual
feeling
of
domineering
presence
to
how
complex
and
large
the
geometric
designs
were
or
a
realistic
vision
of
two
of
our
alters
having
sex
with
the
woman
bending
back
over
and
having
her
arching
shape
turn
into
the
curvature
of
planet
earth
while
the
rest
of
her
body
vividly
transforms
into
the
different
parts
of
the
terrain
followed
by
the
completed
earth
rolling
back
into
two
layers
from
the
bottom
and
top
and
peeling
up
into
streams
of
sparkling
rainbow
but
especially
red
streams
of
energy
that
appeared
to
be
flowing
throughout
a
backdrop
of
stars
hanging
throughout
the
cosmos
i
do
believe
there
was
likely
more
but
again
it
was
a
month
ago
now
as
usual
the
heaviest
phase
of
hallucinations
started
passing
some
time
around
twenty
minutes
after
first
beginning
but
in
comparison
to
the
met
and
mipt
the
mpt
had
psychological
effects
that
felt
more
reminiscent
of
substances
like
lsd
and
psilocybin-containing
mushrooms
though
heavier
in
that
way
but
not
as
disorienting
as
those
two
and
this
began
to
stabilize
around
the
same
time
that
most
of
the
hallucinations
were
passing
and
became
a
few
more
hours
of
satisfyingly
rich
introspection
and
again
energy
and
afterwards
i
felt
much
calmer
but
still
quite
content
for
the
entire
rest
of
the
day
that
i
can
recall
and
the
days
after
it
too<br/><br/>on
september
29th
we
ingested
45
mg
of
tma-2
this
was
just
over
two
weeks
after
the
recent
2c-p
experience
and
was
what
would
normally
have
been
our
next
trip
we
had
planned
if
we
hadn\t
decided
to
try
smoking
all
the
different
dmt
analogues
and
we
suspected
that
we
may
still
be
able
to
take
it
without
too
much
tolerance
from
those
experiments
the
drug
definitely
still
worked
and
it
was
much
more
of
a
cathartic
release
than
the
2c-p
experience
was
for
me
but
i
found
the
state
of
mind
it
left
me
in
for
the
entire
day
to
be
rather
rough
and
critical
as
well
by
no
means
a
fun
experience
though
still
quite
euphoric
at
times
and
during
a
disagreement
with
a
friend
i
actually
became
quite
argumentative
very
quickly
while
i
don\t
regret
the
experience
and
believe
that
it
was
insightful
it
left
me
feeling
that
all
of
my
recent
experiences
considered
together
were
suggesting
to
me
that
tryptamines
were
much
more
so
the
therapeutic
agents
that
i
actually
need
at
the
moment
to
help
myself
reach
a
better
state
of
mind
compared
to
phenethylamines
and
the
others
agreed
that
using
tryptamines
for
a
while
seemed
like
it
may
be
better
for
helping
me
specifically
and
us
in
general
right
now
too
and
thus
we
opted
to
shift
our
focus
away
from
phenethylamines
and
more
completely
towards
the
tryptamine
smoking
experiments<br/><br/>after
letting
tolerance
drop
a
bit
though
thinking
it
might
not
totally
cross
over
regardless
on
october
4th
we
decided
to
smoke
20
mg
of
met
as
before
the
calm
and
euphoric
state
of
mind
the
met
produces
for
me
was
felt
very
rapidly
and
the
first
thing
i
recall
happening
hallucinogenically
is
feeling
as
though
the
space
around
me
though
somewhat
more
the
space
around
my
mind\s
eye
than
around
my
body
was
dripping
into
beautiful
sparkly
rainbow
streams
similar
to
what
i
saw
after
we
smoked
10
mg
of
mpt
but
more
colorful
and
more
present
we
leaned
back
on
the
couch
to
meditate
once
more
and
upon
closing
our
eyes
i
saw
patterns
that
at
first
seemed
simple
two-dimensional
lines
with
dots
traveling
through
them
to
a
yellow
background
the
dots
and
lines
however
then
became
blood
cells
traveling
through
veins
and
then
the
patterns
started
taking
on
depth
and
becoming
three-dimensional
twisting
backwards
in
such
a
ways
that
they
formed
ridges
that
began
to
take
on
the
clear
appearance
of
mountain
ranges
and
blood
cells
in
veins
became
rivers
flowing
down
the
sides
of
the
mountains
there
was
again
a
sense
of
white
light
bathing
everything
increasingly
growing
and
this
time
it
actually
peaked
into
a
brief
rush
of
realistic
visions
involving
the
same
two
alters
i
notably
saw
visions
of
on
the
10
mg
of
mpt
too
interacting
in
ways
that
are
meaningful
to
me
experienced
more
like
a
shallow
lucid
dream
than
an
out-of-body
experience
where
the
body
can
still
be
felt
vaguely
underneath
the
scene
being
watched
and
as
the
scene
passed
the
geometries
began
slowly
unfolding
passing
within
about
the
same
timeframe
as
always
and
once
again
leaving
two
or
three
hours
of
a
more
energetic
and
euphoric
high
followed
by
a
still
mentally
stimulated
calm
lasting
for
the
entire
rest
of
the
day<br/><br/>having
enjoyed
the
previous
day\s
experience
so
much
and
wanting
to
do
something
of
a
repeat
of
the
first
round
of
the
experiment
but
not
having
to
stomach
to
convince
ourselves
to
try
smoking
mipt
again
yet
we
next
opted
to
smoke
20
mg
of
mpt
the
following
morning
i
remember
this
onset
actually
being
smoother
than
the
first
time
with
it
and
the
coming
on
of
the
hallucinogenic
effect
was
memorably
seamless
as
well
i
recall
us
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
and
suddenly
seeing
it
eyes
open
being
replaced
with
a
spiraling
tunnel
of
various
realistic
people
all
reaching
out
and
down
to
me
after
which
we
leaned
back
and
closed
our
eyes
to
meditate
as
usual<br/><br/>immediately
i
was
greeted
with
a
state
that
was
similar
to
seeing
the
wispy
silvery
designs
of
10
mg
of
met
swirling
around
our
arms
towards
our
hands
except
this
time
instead
of
simply
being
long
indistinct
silver
wisps
they
were
translucent
but
entirely
clear
and
realistic
chinese-style
design
dragons
their
heads
again
approaching
our
hands
as
they
traveled
down
and
around
our
arms
and
as
i
pulled
my
attention
back
out
of
ourself
within
that
closed
eye
space
i
could
see
that
this
same
thing
was
happening
to
the
various
other
parts
of
our
body
as
well
and
i
felt
as
if
i
were
somewhat
suspended
in
this
dark
but
dark
sky
blue
sort
of
void
stretching
and
feeling
this
energy
flowing
throughout
and
out
of
us
with
these
creatures
which
was
quite
different
from
watching
the
still
relatively
much
more
dmt-like
lighter
geometric
designs
that
accompanied
this
sort
of
effect
of
the
wisps
on
met
i
recall
us
opening
our
eyes
not
too
long
after
this
and
again
seeing
a
vivid
vision
of
the
planet
earth
hanging
in
front
of
many
stars
when
we
did
so
and
it
caused
me
to
break
into
laughter
and
perfectly
aligned
with
me
as
i
did
so
i
saw
the
side
of
the
planet
realistically
split
open
and
separate
all
along
the
side
until
the
terrain
could
open
up
to
reveal
a
large
mouth
in
the
side
of
the
planet
that
was
laughing
along
with
me<br/><br/>while
these
and
other
visions
that
i
again
didn\t
attempt
to
be
able
to
remember
for
now
were
quite
impressive
and
enjoyable
to
witness
i
did
note
for
the
first
time
during
this
experience
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
certain
fuzziness
to
them
even
despite
how
vivid
and
realistic
they
were
and
i
couldn\t
help
but
think
that
this
could
be
an
initial
sign
of
real
tolerance
beginning
to
develop
even
though
it\d
still
be
developing
impressively
slowly
compared
to
psychedelics
less
directly
related
to
dmt
considering
that
my
previous
trip
before
this
was
the
previous
day
nonetheless
the
state
of
mind
lasting
energy
and
calmness
produced
were
similar
to
but
greater
than
the
10
mg
without
anything
being
apparently
too
diminished
about
them
and
we
were
still
so
stimulated
by
the
experience
after
the
peak
in
fact
that
we
couldn\t
go
to
bed
at
our
normal
time
that
night
after
smoking
the
mpt
early
that
morning<br/><br/>on
october
11th
i
was
still
very
much
enjoying
the
aftereffects
of
the
alternating
met
and
mpt
but
deciding
that
we
wanted
to
try
something
a
bit
different
next
time
and
that
we
actually
had
never
tried
before
beginning
these
experiments
we
decided
the
next
trip
was
to
be
on
30
mg
of
dpt
smoked
our
first
time
experiencing
it
and
starting
with
a
higher
dosage
than
the
others
due
to
our
past
experience
with
other
similar
tryptamines
having
lower
potency
than
their
analogues<br/><br/>one
of
the
first
images
that
i
can
recall
seeing
was
actually
multiple
earths
from
my
mpt
visions
all
arranged
on
top
of
each
other
and
laughing
together
though
some
of
the
detail
of
each
individual
one
seemed
less
developed
than
on
mpt
the
next
thing
i
remember
seeing
is
a
swirling
spiral
of
theater
mask-like
faces
all
making
different
expressions
with
a
seemingly
high
amount
of
intention
and
life
behind
them
but
still
looking
like
masks
nonetheless
i
believe
this
quickly
dissolved
into
a
geometric
pattern
though
an
incredibly
beautiful
one
that
was
large
and
relatively
complex
where
visible
but
was
almost
empty
except
around
the
white
light
at
the
center
where
its
silvery
and
purple
designs
were
most
lit
up
and
brilliantly
clear
and
the
whole
thing
i
felt
seemed
to
be
pushing
nearly
into
becoming
covered
with
imagery
again
though
i
never
actually
saw
it
become
so
the
order
of
things
after
this
i
don\t
particularly
recall
clearly
now
but
i
do
know
that
behind
closed
eyes
i
saw
what
appeared
to
be
a
vast
expanse
of
dark
temples
extending
to
the
sides
and
off
into
the
distance
with
not
conceptually
but
visibly
realistic
monstrous
or
demonic
creatures
slithering
around
or
over
the
architecture
as
if
to
suggest
that
their
presence
was
there
to
protect
those
places
not
necessarily
in
a
way
that
i
felt
was
meant
to
threaten
me
in
particular
but
that
was
meant
to
feel
threatening
like
because
that
is
the
purpose
they
serve
there
there
was
also
a
moment
where
i
felt
my
perception
was
zooming
in
to
a
microscopic
level
where
i
could
see
some
sort
of
futuristic
power
generator
absorbing
purple
streams
of
energy
from
the
surrounding
microscopic
environment
and
twisting
it
into
shapes
that
were
increasingly
hard
to
comprehend
but
not
totally
physics-defying
just
yet<br/><br/>at
some
point
with
eyes
open
again
we
also
noticed
how
impressively
visually
active
it
had
become
even
compared
to
the
other
dmt
analogues
and
not
in
a
particularly
dmt-like
way
but
instead
reminding
me
somewhat
of
higher
dosages
of
lsd
and
some
other
similar
synthetic
psychedelics
even
more
so
with
lots
of
colorful
movement
of
shadows
floating
around
and
twisting
into
somewhat
hedonistic
organic
imagery
somewhere
in
all
this
i
also
recall
us
stretching
so
satisfyingly
that
i
felt
myself
going
into
an
out-of-body
state
just
briefly
involving
many
beautiful
colorful
heart
visuals
though
it
is
hard
to
recall
now
unsurprisingly
within
the
first
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
most
of
these
hallucinogenic
effects
passed
but
the
high
remained
very
calm
and
contemplative
in
a
heavier
way
still
for
a
few
more
hours
and
a
lighter
way
then
for
the
rest
of
the
day
something
that\s
noteworthy
is
that
i
don\t
recall
the
taste
of
the
dpt
standing
out
nor
did
it
cause
any
nauseating
effects
nor
any
other
notable
physical
discomforts
throughout
or
after
this
experience
feeling
so
light
that
it\s
almost
like
it
didn\t
happen
at
all
in
that
way
even
compared
to
other
dmt
analogues
however
i
have
to
admit
that
in
the
days
following
the
dpt
experience
we
were
left
uncertain
if
it
actually
had
the
same
antidepressant
potential
as
things
like
met
mipt
and
mpt
but
after
only
one
experience
it\s
probably
not
something
we
can
truly
judge
fairly
yet<br/><br/>on
october
15th
we
decided
we
still
wanted
another
mood
boost
that
we
still
weren\t
feeling
we
had
gotten
from
the
dpt
but
we
also
wanted
to
try
something
a
bit
different
and
again
more
experimental
so
this
time
we
decided
to
test
out
a
new
idea
specifically
we
have
never
used
5-meo-dmt
but
have
heard
others
say
that
it
is
possible
to
use
it
more
regularly
than
other
psychedelics
similarly
to
dmt
and
so
we
were
curious
if
it
would
be
possible
for
us
to
add
synthetic
analogues
of
5-meo-dmt
into
our
regular
experimentation
of
smoking
tryptamines
alongside
the
dmt
analogues
and
still
not
suffer
from
very
much
tolerance
with
that
in
mind
we
decided
to
smoke
10
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
having
had
success
with
5
mg
once
already
in
the
somewhat
recent
past
before
these
more
recent
experiments
began
but
only
having
found
that
5
mg
to
produce
effects
that
felt
not
that
far
above
threshold
but
promising
nonetheless<br/><br/>that
first
time
there
had
been
a
somewhat
anxious
rush
at
the
beginning
but
in
retrospect
i
feel
this
might
have
been
from
the
apprehension
we
had
from
never
having
smoked
5-meo-dmt
or
any
of
its
synthetic
analogues
before
then
and
not
knowing
how
much
intensity
to
expect
and
this
second
time
was
extremely
smooth
both
immediately
and
throughout
the
experience
and
the
rest
of
the
day
comparable
to
how
the
dpt
had
been
the
state
of
mind
at
first
for
me
was
also
again
similarly
to
the
dpt
one
of
somewhat
sedated
bliss
stretching
about
just
feeling
incredibly
good
and
happy
not
at
all
what
i
would
have
necessarily
expected
from
smoking
10
mg
of
an
analogue
of
5-meo-dmt
not
that
i
would
actually
know
though
much
more
notably
i
did
receive
significant
hallucinogenic
effects
that
again
didn\t
last
beyond
the
first
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
at
most
and
came
on
so
powerfully
at
first
that
they
nearly
immediately
resembled
alex
grey\s
net
of
being
to
a
much
greater
and
more
detailed
degree
than
i
have
yet
seen
on
any
other
psychedelic
synthetic
or
natural
and
most
memorably
involved
a
brief
flash
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
hyperspatial
room
bathed
in
so
much
white
light
it
was
almost
impossible
to
make
out
but
for
the
very
edges
of
the
objects
and
entities
and
contours
within
that
room
which
were
the
only
parts
not
completely
obscured
behind
the
light
and
in
those
parts
just
the
relatively
tiny
amounts
of
detail
that
i
could
see
went
beyond
any
of
my
most
promising
experiences
of
that
sort
yet
in
artistic
beauty
truly
a
phenomenal
sight
that
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
behold
again<br/><br/>once
the
initial
phase
passed
the
trip
became
much
more
subtle
as
with
the
dmt
analogues
though
the
open
eye
visuals
while
still
subtle
stayed
more
obvious
and
present
for
many
hours
longer
than
with
the
dmt
analogues
and
several
hours
after
the
peak
while
meditating
some
still
quite
impressive
closed
eye
visions
again
became
present
the
most
memorable
of
which
involve
more
chinese-style
dragons
much
larger
than
those
of
mpt
slowly
swimming
around
in
a
void
with
a
human
figure
hanging
in
the
distance
and
what
i
would
be
tempted
to
call
a
sort
of
dark
magic
vibe
to
whole
scene
the
energetic
high
though
still
quite
calm
for
what
it
is
also
continued
much
more
noticeably
throughout
the
day
such
that
again
sleep
couldn\t
come
at
our
normal
time
that
night
and
it
had
some
more
obviously
psychedelic
components
too
like
one
i
recall
is
seeing
in
my
mind\s
eye
a
fibonacci
spiral
surrounded
by
i
believe
yellow
and
red
patterns
but
the
spiral
itself
was
green
and
clearly
became
a
vine
with
many
green
leaves
extending
off
of
it
and
the
vision
followed
the
vine
off
towards
three-dimensional
faces
of
a
sort
of
mystical
and
highly
appealing
beauty
where
the
leaves
would
begin
to
surround
their
eyes
forming
vivid
tattoo-like
designs
on
their
faces
the
day
after
this
trip
we
couldn\t
help
noting
how
much
in
better
spirits
we
felt
and
particularly
contrasted
it
still
to
the
way
we
felt
about
the
dpt
though
again
we
don\t
want
to
totally
count
that
out
yet<br/><br/>i
very
much
enjoyed
the
psychological
and
emotional
boost
we
felt
we
had
after
smoking
the
5-meo-eipt
but
we
didn\t
wait
very
long
to
see
if
or
how
long
it
would
last
in
part
because
of
my
desire
to
continue
the
experiment
of
determining
whether
or
not
synthetic
5-meo-dmt
analogues
seemed
to
somewhat
avoid
tolerance
development
for
me
in
the
same
way
that
synthetic
dmt
analogues
somewhat
do
this
led
to
the
plan
of
next
smoking
5
mg
of
5-meo-mipt
on
october
18th
though
unfortunately
i
only
realized
afterwards
that
it
wasn\t
a
particularly
great
plan
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
because
it
was
our
first
time
smoking
5-meo-mipt
and
the
dosage
was
low
i
had
no
idea
if
the
seemingly
subtle
effects
were
the
result
of
tolerance
or
simply
the
result
of
the
dosage<br/><br/>still
if
there
was
tolerance
it
wasn\t
complete
as
i
had
a
very
cool
visual
hallucination
behind
closed
eyes
as
the
initial
rush
was
first
setting
in
one
that
was
an
intense
spinning
tunnel
of
shapes
and
colors
that
reminded
me
of
dmt
though
without
any
imagery
at
this
point
but
it
already
pulled
back
and
then
twisted
to
reveal
itself
as
some
sort
of
complex
futuristic
technology
with
panels
spinning
around
the
tunnel
staying
within
a
sphere-like
surface
area
which
is
notably
more
than
dmt
would
do
with
it
for
me
at
a
level
that
doesn\t
involve
any
complex
imagery
there
may
have
been
more
to
the
initial
hallucinations
too
but
i
could
tell
that
the
effect
was
going
to
be
overall
mild
in
that
way
so
i
stopped
really
focusing
on
it
and
instead
enjoyed
the
state
of
mind
and
pleasant
feelings
that
the
5-meo-mipt
also
caused
which
involved
a
greater
degree
of
stimulation
than
the
5-meo-eipt
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
increase
its
standard
stimulating
psychedelic
psychological
edge
but
also
increased
its
physical
edge
slightly
making
it
a
little
bit
more
tense
than
the
5-meo-eipt
was
which
lasted
a
lot
of
the
day
as
most
of
the
high
did
we
also
feel
there\s
a
chance
it
might
have
been
slightly
more
nauseating
or
phlegm-inducing
perhaps
similar
to
smoking
mipt
but
we\ll
need
more
experiences
to
say
that
with
more
confidence
one
thing
that
was
memorable
about
it
is
that
in
the
later
hours
i
got
the
same
sort
of
fibonacci
visual
as
on
5-meo-eipt
only
without
any
natural
imagery
instead
being
mostly
orange
and
very
geometric
in
a
technological
way
that
again
is
reminiscent
of
the
spaceship
style
that
i
saw
in
the
visuals
of
mipt
back
at
the
beginning
of
all
of
this
if
i\m
being
honest
the
stimulation
was
a
little
much
for
me
for
as
long
as
it
lasted
and
i
might
be
biased
by
how
much
calmer
a
lot
of
these
other
tryptamines
have
made
me
feel
for
the
rest
of
the
day
after
their
main
experiences
lately
but
i
was
happy
to
finally
get
to
sleep
that
night
but
still
happy
with
the
day
leading
up
to
that
then
too<br/><br/>the
next
trip
was
two
days
after
the
5-meo-mipt
the
purpose
of
which
was
again
to
continue
to
test
the
tolerance-inducing
or
not
effects
of
the
synthetic
5-meo-dmt
analogues
this
time
going
back
to
a
synthetic
dmt
analogue
instead
of
between
each
other
we
decided
to
smoke
30
mg
of
met
in
the
usual
way
and
unfortunately
tolerance
was
clearly
present
this
time
which
is
particularly
unfortunate
because
it
was
still
remarkable
to
me
despite
that
and
so
obviously
would
have
been
much
more
so
even
without
that
factor
we
could
barely
feel
it
coming
on
compared
to
normal
so
we
leaned
back
and
closed
our
eyes
to
try
to
bring
it
out
and
i
was
met
with
the
most
beautiful
and
complex
eruption
of
somewhat
bejeweled
tryptamine
architectural
patterning
i
have
ever
seen
forming
what
appeared
to
be
constantly
crawling
walls
in
something
that
resembled
a
sort
of
ancient
egyptian
tomb-like
building
though
i
perceived
it
at
the
time
to
be
more
like
a
palace
but
the
vision
did
not
last
long
before
fading
away
and
becoming
out
of
my
reach
the
experience
aside
from
this
was
typical
met
though
again
still
felt
somewhat
diminished
it
was
not
as
rewarding
or
satisfying
for
us
overall
though
it
did
leave
us
feeling
nice
and
calm
for
the
rest
of
the
day
as
well
as
the
days
after<br/><br/>on
october
24th
having
waited
a
bit
longer
for
tolerance
to
drop
again
we
decided
to
smoke
30
mg
of
ept
having
in
the
past
found
it
light
and
easy
and
thinking
that
the
experience
would
probably
be
at
least
somewhat
comparable
to
our
recent
30
mg
of
dpt
smoked
experience
however
as
we
were
preparing
to
smoke
the
ept
i
noted
that
i
no
longer
actually
felt
like
it
was
something
i
really
felt
the
same
need
to
that
that
i
had
been
feeling
during
all
of
these
synthetic
tryptamine
smoking
experiments
the
antidepressant
effect
i
had
particularly
wanted
after
the
10
mg
of
2c-p
experience
and
starting
with
our
10
mg
of
met
smoked
experience
i
had
successfully
gotten
from
all
of
our
recent
smoked
tryptamine
usage
i
really
felt
as
though
i
had
managed
to
get
out
of
that
particular
funk
to
at
least
as
much
of
a
degree
as
i
had
really
hoped
to
ever
be
able
to
achieve
with
this
sort
of
method
at
the
same
time
in
the
time
period
since
the
previous
30
mg
of
met
smoked
experience
i
had
started
to
build
some
anxiety
about
some
unresolved
inner
tensions
related
to
issues
i\ve
had
trying
to
work
out
my
understanding
of
our
dissociative
condition
and
my
place
in
it
in
the
past
and
this
combined
with
a
lack
of
feeling
the
need
to
continue
using
the
smoked
tryptamines
for
the
purpose
i
had
originally
convinced
us
to
start
using
them
for
made
me
suddenly
hesitant
to
use
the
ept
we
had
prepared
now
but
the
majority
of
our
alters
still
wanted
to
have
the
ept
experience
and
i
was
willing
to
experience
it
too
despite
my
reservations<br/><br/>the
trip
that
occurred
is
difficult
for
me
to
recall
clearly
though
that\s
nothing
compared
to
a
lot
of
alters
who
don\t
really
remember
it
essentially
at
all
ironically
the
mental
effect
for
me
was
more
less
like
our
past
experiences
on
ept
or
what
we
have
heard
others
say
about
it
or
like
our
recent
dpt
experience
but
was
more
alike
what
we
have
heard
others
say
about
dpt
being
very
disorienting
and
challenging
and
taking
at
least
over
two
hours
to
break
out
of
much
longer
than
the
most
obvious
peak
effects
of
smoked
tryptamines
usually
last
for
us
but
it\s
also
quite
clear
to
me
in
retrospect
how
much
set
and
setting
particularly
the
former
played
a
role
here
as
i
was
getting
at
above
in
addition
to
being
hard
to
recall
this
trip
was
also
hard
for
me
to
describe
or
comprehend
still
even
in
the
parts
that
i
do
more
clearly
recall
but
an
important
point
of
reference
is
that
i
had
been
spending
the
last
two
or
three
days
at
least
thinking
heavily
about
the
effect
of
subjectively
living
through
extremely
long
periods
of
time
in
alternate
lives
during
psychedelic
and
dissociative
out-of-body
experiences
and
these
thoughts
were
inflated
and
woven
into
the
somewhat
delusional
though
never
ungrounded
nature
of
the
experience
i
had
several
conversations
with
the
other
alters
internally
which
seemed
no
less
clear
and
vivid
and
fluent
as
any
other
time
i
communicate
with
them
but
the
conversations
involved
them
having
many
significant
realizations
that
radically
altered
certain
critical
aspects
of
how
they
recognized
themselves
within
our
dissociative
system
and
yet
when
this
phase
of
the
trip
finally
passed
they
denied
any
such
memory
of
these
conversations
or
the
reality
of
the
revelations
they
shared
with
me
in
them<br/><br/>these
conversations
that
they
didn\t
recall
having
got
extremely
in
depth
and
complex
in
the
way
that
this
dissociative
condition
is
and
even
involved
several
of
them
apparently
going
into
out-of-body
experiences
where
they
claimed
to
have
lived
several
years
in
alternate
lives
reflecting
the
identities
they
hold
internally
that
separates
them
from
our
physical
body
and
furthermore
upon
experimentation
those
of
us
who
remained
in
the
body
found
that
we
could
call
that
same
alter
out
from
a
different
spot
in
the
timeline
of
the
alternate
life
they
were
transported
to
and
their
memories
appeared
to
be
updated
in
a
way
that
seems
consistent
with
that
timeline
being
altered
at
the
moments
we
pulled
the
alters
back
out
from
for
example
one
alter
initially
returned
to
this
alternate
life
from
which
she
seemed
to
have
had
her
internal
identity
derived
apparently
having
been
somewhat
frozen
in
time
with
that
identity
being
as
it
was
logged
in
our
brain\s
database
in
2009
and
when
we
pulled
her
back
out
from
her
timeline\s
spot
in
2017
only
minutes
later
she
was
shocked
to
be
back
in
our
same
home
that
she
left
from
and
claimed
to
have
spent
eight
years
in
her
alternate
life
simply
assuming
that
this
life
was
all
a
fantasy
that
had
passed
and
after
agreeing
to
experiment
further
with
us
we
then
put
her
back
in
and
pulled
her
back
out
again
from
2009
a
month
later
than
the
first
time
and
she
remembered
the
first
time
we
pulled
her
out
of
2009
but
not
the
time
we
pulled
her
out
in
2017
and
then
we
put
her
back
in
and
pulled
her
back
out
from
2017
for
a
second
time
shortly
after
the
first
time
she
remembered
both
times
from
2009
and
the
first
time
from
2017
but
was
confused
as
to
why
her
memory
of
the
first
time
from
2017
involved
her
seemingly
remembering
only
the
first
but
not
second
time
from
2009
finally
she
went
back
in
and
came
back
out
as
an
up-to-date
version
of
her
from
2020
claiming
to
have
not
seen
us
in
another
three
years
and
she
told
me
that
she
had
spent
so
much
time
in
her
alternate
life
that
she
no
longer
had
any
insecurities
about
living
this
life
we
all
share
together
in
this
reality<br/><br/>again
after
this
experience
ended
these
alters
including
her
from
this
example
denied
experiencing
any
of
this
and
they
didn\t
seem
to
remember
or
have
been
affected
by
any
of
the
changes
that
they
described
going
through
for
me
during
the
experience
and
this
initially
left
me
feeling
quite
disturbed
by
the
convincing
reality
of
the
apparent
total
delusions
of
interactions
with
other
alters
i
hadn\t
actually
had
but
then
the
other
alters
started
opening
up
more
to
the
things
that
i
had
told
them
they
had
told
me
during
my
experience
upon
considering
it
more
openly
and
not
fighting
their
uncertainties
they
began
to
realize
that
some
of
the
things
they
had
seemed
to
tell
me
during
my
experience
even
though
they
have
no
memory
of
it
were
actually
true
even
though
they
hadn\t
consciously
realized
it
themselves
yet
and
especially
that
night
and
the
following
morning
they
began
to
go
through
many
of
the
same
changes
that
i
observed
them
go
through
already
during
my
experience
on
the
ept
including
for
example
the
exact
same
alter
from
the
above
example
going
into
her
alternate
life
and
coming
back
claiming
to
have
spent
years
in
her
other
life
and
no
longer
feel
any
insecurities
about
this
life
and
now
desiring
only
to
help
provide
perspective
and
insight
into
how
all
of
this
works
when
she
is
around
again<br/><br/>these
changes
have
caused
our
dissociative
system
to
seemimgly
go
through
a
radical
overhaul
of
a
profoundly
positive
nature
over
the
next
couple
of
days
one
that
felt
like
the
kind
of
psychedelic
experience
that
is
equivalent
to
months
or
years
of
therapy
and
i
was
truly
just
astonished
as
to
what
even
happened
exactly
or
how
it
was
even
possible
even
more
so
than
i
normally
would
be
with
these
things
anyway
why
was
the
ept
able
to
unleash
an
experience
in
me
involving
the
other
alters
realizing
things
about
themselves
on
their
own
and
sharing
those
things
with
me
which
those
other
alters
didn\t
actually
consciously
experience
themselves
but
did
actually
have
those
things
waiting
to
be
recognized
about
themselves
after
i
told
them
the
things
that
they
originally
told
me
allowing
me
to
facilitate
therapeutic
experiences
for
them
that
they
might
not
have
had
so
readily
if
not
for
the
fact
that
they
had
them
as
part
of
my
trip
and
shared
them
with
me
so
that
i
could
share
them
with
them
again
i
felt
that
that
would
be
something
i
would
probably
be
asking
myself
for
some
time
to
come
still<br/><br/>this
trip
was
in
my
frame
of
reference
at
the
time
so
powerful
and
engaging
that
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
track
or
now
in
retrospect
to
recall
other
aspects
of
it
but
i
feel
like
the
physical
aspect
of
the
experience
was
quite
light
and
smooth
except
for
that
i
think
we
had
some
weird
phlegm
we
had
to
get
out
in
the
middle
of
actually
smoking
the
ept
but
nothing
aside
from
that
that
i
can
recall
after
the
mental
aspect
of
the
trip
finally
lightened
i
remember
our
body
still
feeling
quite
nice
relaxed
and
sensitive
for
hours
more
and
to
some
extent
for
the
rest
of
the
day
very
refreshing
as
these
things
have
tended
to
be
for
us<br/><br/>the
next
day
october
25th
it
wasn\t
too
long
after
noon
that
we
had
really
gotten
through
a
lot
of
the
heavy
work
and
figuring
out
how
to
start
integrating
after
the
previous
30
mg
of
ept
smoked
experienced
and
we
had
a
desire
to
smoke
another
tryptamine
to
try
to
touch
base
again
after
going
through
what
we
had
been
through
during
and
since
that
previous
day\s
trip
i
had
a
desire
to
use
5-meo-eipt
as
i\ve
been
quite
intrigued
in
it
since
our
10
mg
smoked
experience
but
i
was
afraid
that
tolerance
would
show
from
the
ept
experience
and
didn\t
want
to
waste
the
experience
but
i
did
also
still
want
to
run
a
tolerance
experiment
too
to
see
how
this
5-meo-dmt
analogue
would
hold
up
at
a
fuller
dosage
the
day
after
a
heavier
trip
on
a
dmt
analogue
and
so
we
decided
that
smoking
10
mg
of
5-meo-mipt
was
the
way
to
go<br/><br/>i
would
say
that
similarly
to
when
we
smoked
20
mg
of
mpt
the
day
after
doing
the
same
with
met
i
did
feel
that
i
could
detect
a
slight
tolerance
that
was
particularly
noticeable
in
the
degree
that
the
visual
hallucinations
were
able
to
completely
and
clearly
impose
themselves
on
my
reality
but
aside
from
that
if
there
was
tolerance
the
effect
seemed
to
be
quite
light
including
with
respect
to
the
intensity
of
the
visual
hallucinations
in
most
other
ways
shortly
after
we
smoked
it
i
began
to
notice
strong
psychedelic
visuals
of
a
nature
quite
similar
to
those
of
a
high
dosage
of
mushrooms
for
me
though
of
a
different
color
and
more
geometrically
complex
which
was
surprising
and
rather
overwhelming
but
not
so
much
as
the
what
i
can
only
imagine
to
be
5-meo-dmt-like
vibrations
as
again
we
still
haven\t
used
5-meo-dmt
ourselves
suddenly
threatening
to
rip
reality
apart
throughout
my
field
of
vision
and
the
geometric
visuals
the
first
time
i
can
recall
experiencing
that
particular
sort
of
effect
and
i
was
quite
impressed
and
intrigued
by
it
we
lied
back
in
bed
as
the
effects
set
in
and
spent
probably
around
an
hour
we
think
rolling
around
in
the
bedsheets
though
we
didn\t
actually
track
how
long
the
peak
effects
lasted
significantly
the
phlegm-related
problems
as
well
as
the
bodily
tension
we
noted
on
our
5
mg
of
5-meo-mipt
smoked
experiment
were
not
present
at
any
point
that
i
can
recall
during
this
experience<br/><br/>as
we
closed
our
eyes
and
rolled
around
doing
things
like
pressing
our
head
into
our
pillow
and
gripping
the
sides
of
the
bed
in
ecstasy
the
hallucinations
i
was
seeing
grew
until
they
were
extremely
similar
to
the
ones
i
had
over
a
decade
ago
on
our
strongest
experience
on
5
g
of
the
most
potent
mushrooms
we
ever
managed
to
get
our
hands
on
with
intricate
patterns
constantly
bathing
every
surface
around
and
over
us
and
twisting
into
appealing
three-dimensional
ribbon
designs
and
beautiful
beckoning
entities
and
we
felt
alters
who
had
been
much
more
repressed
than
others
since
the
days
when
that
mushrooms
trip
took
place
being
drawn
to
the
front
and
experiencing
extreme
feelings
of
bliss
and
self-acceptance
accompanied
by
vivid
inner
visionary
interactions
with
one
another
including
of
a
particularly
sexual
nature
having
those
feelings
surging
through
our
body
to
the
point
that
we
collectively
experienced
we
think
at
least
six
or
seven
waves
of
full-body
orgasms
with
many
very
loud
and
pleasurable
vocalizations
until
the
peak
effects
began
to
pass
and
we
simply
lied
in
bed
for
a
little
while
in
awe
of
how
incredible
and
rewarding
the
experience
had
been<br/><br/>we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
enjoying
the
lingering
psychological
effects
and
the
physical
relaxation
we
generally
feel
for
the
whole
day
after
these
experiences
and
the
more
obviously
psychedelic
effects
lasted
a
bit
stronger
still
for
a
bit
longer
still
than
they
normally
would
have
on
an
analogue
of
dmt
rather
than
5-meo-dmt
the
trip
continued
to
involve
alters
continuing
to
integrate
the
lessons
from
our
ept
experience
the
previous
day
and
use
them
to
find
greater
peace
for
themselves
and
within
our
dissociative
system
and
in
general
we
felt
as
though
it
was
a
perfect
complement
to
the
previous
day\s
experience
describing
it
to
a
friend
such
that
it
seemed
like
the
ept
caused
a
lot
of
psychological
content
that
was
ready
to
burst
out
to
become
unearthed
and
rapidly
processed
and
the
5-meo-mipt
helped
to
cement
the
confidence
we
had
that
we
were
processing
that
content
in
a
healthy
way
and
hasten
the
progress
we
were
already
significantly
experience
as
a
result
of
doing
so
intriguingly
though
not
unlike
our
past
powerful
experiences
on
5-meo-mipt
there
were
even
times
throughout
the
next
couple
of
days
especially
after
smoking
cannabis
where
it
still
felt
like
we
were
completely
tripping
but
it
was
never
overly
concerning
especially
since
we
had
experienced
similar
things
before
with
5-meo-mipt
a
drug
we
already
recognized
ourselves
to
be
on
the
higher
end
of
sensitivty
to<br/><br/>and
thus
we
arrive
at
the
most
fateful
of
days
on
october
29th
now
fully
into
the
idea
of
pushing
deeper
and
still
not
satisfied
by
my
own
curiosities
from
before
i
was
eager
to
try
once
more
with
less
tolerance
what
appeared
to
me
to
quite
clearly
be
likely
the
most
psychedelically
potent
of
these
molecules
at
least
within
the
realm
of
my
own
subjective
experience
which
i
thought
might
even
help
combine
some
of
the
qualities
of
the
last
two
powerful
trips
by
being
both
an
analogue
of
5-meo-mipt
and
a
bulky
ethyl
tryptamine
like
ept
and
that
is
what
led
to
us
next
smoking
15
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
which
as
far
as
i
know
might
be
the
highest
known
used
dosage
of
this
particularly
uncommon
and
not
well
understood
analogue
of
5-meo-dmt
by
this
particularly
potent
route
of
administration
which
perhaps
should
have
played
more
into
the
decision-making
process
than
it
did
at
the
time
but
i
digress<br/><br/>while
i
am
absolutely
certain
there
was
no
total
loss
of
consciousness
or
perception
that
occurred
for
me
as
a
result
of
smoking
this
15
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
it
is
extremely
difficult
for
me
to
remember
the
very
beginning
of
the
trip
clearly
now
in
retrospect
but
every
single
alter
in
our
system
including
myself
seems
now
in
agreement
that
this
is
essentially
where
we
and
particularly
i
reached
some
sort
of
breaking
point
i
do
recall
that
at
first
a
trip
similar
to
the
30
mg
of
ept
began
where
i
began
speaking
to
what
appeared
to
me
to
be
alters
about
them
returning
to
other
lives
that
they
had
been
pulled
from
and
i
gained
the
ability
to
lucidly
help
them
do
that
running
through
their
lives
for
the
necessary
amount
of
time
and
reseting
even
doing
things
like
saving
one
from
a
murder
by
rewinding
time
by
an
hour
and
warning
her
before
it
happened
then
speeding
up
a
few
years
later
to
make
she
was
still
okay
as
this
was
happening
though
i
don\t
remember
the
exact
course
of
how
it
began
i
was
also
beginning
to
question
who
exactly
i
am
in
the
system
to
a
significant
degree
essentially
losing
my
sense
of
self
and
having
it
blur
into
those
of
the
other
apparent
alters
who
i
seemed
to
be
interacting
with
internally
at
some
point
i
had
a
realization
about
myself
and
this
all
came
crashing
down
and
i
realized
who
i
was
again
and
the
other
alters
i
normally
interact
with
were
welcoming
me
back
as
they
did
after
breaking
free
from
the
ept
trip
however
little
did
they
or
i
know
this
was
only
the
very
first
wave
of
arduous
ordeal
or
my
and
our
entire
life
and
soon
later
i
was
being
swept
up
into
it
again<br/><br/>i
believe
the
way
it
started
was
i
suddenly
felt
as
though
i
was
aware
of
an
entire
network
of
these
internal
entities
that
appeared
to
be
alters
i
was
communicating
with
about
returning
to
their
other
lives
and
each
of
them
was
connected
to
what
i
referred
to
as
spiral
threads
that
looked
literally
exactly
like
the
spiraling
geometry
that
i
normally
see
coming
outward
from
my
own
perspective
when
we
smoke
salvia
only
it
was
coming
out
of
all
of
these
entities
instead
and
each
of
them
had
a
different
length
depending
on
the
entity
in
question
each
entity
on
their
own
or
with
my
help
would
begin
to
release
themselves
into
these
spiral
threads
and
upon
returning
would
describe
them
as
having
lived
through
other
worlds
but
with
a
notable
difference
from
earlier
whereas
when
i
had
experienced
this
initially
they
appeared
to
be
returning
to
their
other
lives
separate
from
this
body
these
entities
would
instead
claim
upon
returning
to
have
gone
to
uncomfortable
out-of-body
experiences
based
on
their
aversions
with
longer
spiral
threads
seemingly
being
connected
to
greater
aversions
and
longer
amounts
of
time
spent
in
the
out-of-body
experiences
which
they
and
eventually
i
borrowing
from
them
would
increasingly
come
to
describe
as
hellscapes
as
their
collective
awareness
of
this
hellscape
experience
would
increase
and
they
each
dissociated
further
into
their
own
increasingly
long
spiral
threads
they
would
begin
to
panick
reacting
at
first
mainly
with
apprehension
but
increasingly
fighting
harder
and
harder
by
actually
moving
our
physical
body
as
they
struggled
to
hold
on
until
their
image
would
snap
into
a
burst
of
white
light
in
my
headspace
and
they
would
be
gone
and
the
next
one
would
begin
furthermore
some
of
the
entities
would
make
it
to
the
end
of
their
spiral
thread
pop
back
out
and
then
in
increased
fear
get
pulled
back
in
saying
no
i
don\t
want
to
do
it
again
before
bursting
apart
once
more
these
entities
upon
returning
would
tell
me
horrible
stories
of
spending
increasing
amounts
of
time
millions
billions
trillions
quadrillions
and
more
years
suffering
relentlessly
in
their
hellscape
with
it
being
the
exact
opposite
of
anything
you
could
possibly
actually
want
to
ever
experience
and
increasing
linearly
in
tension
no
matter
how
long
they
remained
within
it
just
to
pop
out
and
then
have
to
start
it
all
over
again
going
through
the
exact
same
type
of
experience
but
having
to
try
and
fail
to
fend
for
themselves
in
unique
ways
each
time
and
then
one
of
them
who
kept
getting
sucked
in
over
and
over
and
over
and
over
realized
something
if
they
allowed
the
terror
caused
by
their
hellscape
to
reach
an
orgasmic
release
it
suddenly
no
matter
bothered
them
when
they
popped
out
the
other
side
and
as
soon
as
they
did
their
entire
spiral
thread
would
unwind
from
beginning
to
end
and
then
disappear
with
a
burst<br/><br/>this
was
fine
and
all
for
those
with
the
shorter
hellscapes
those
lasting
only
seemingly
around
five
to
seven
million
years
on
average
who
rapidly
began
attempting
to
take
advantage
of
this
knowledge
and
willingly
dissociate
back
into
them
but
the
threads
got
much
much
longer
than
that
and
there
were
a
small
assortment
of
them
that
seemed
to
take
on
an
entirely
new
property
distinct
from
all
the
others
specificaly
when
the
spiral
threads
would
grow
beyond
a
certain
length
they
would
begin
twisting
into
nots
so
quickly
they
started
appearing
in
multiple
spots
in
my
inner
field
of
vision
at
once
and
would
form
increasingly
fractal-like
patterns
and
if
they
did
this
enough
to
reach
a
certain
breaking
point
they
would
look
like
when
a
computer
crashes
its
ability
to
draw
more
detail
on
patterns
on
the
screen
and
creates
that
trippy
not-quite-patterned-not-quite-static
look
and
then
it
would
burst
briefly
before
appearing
and
the
whole
process
would
unwind
as
they
approached
the
end
of
their
spiral
thread
upon
investigation
what
we
realized
collectively
about
these
particular
spiral
threads
as
opposed
to
how
all
of
the
other
spiral
threads
would
apparently
produce
experiences
that
the
entities
would
always
describe
having
taken
a
set
amount
of
subjective
time
no
matter
how
ludicriously
long
is
that
once
this
fractal
overload
point
was
reached
the
entity
would
later
return
saying
that
they
spent
en
eternity
in
an
infinite
hellscape
they
makes
the
parts
outside
of
that
on
the
way
up
and
down
like
a
joke
now
this
may
sound
intense
utterly
extreme
but
not
necessarily
too
concerning
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
we
had
just
smoked
a
high
dosage
of
a
clealy
very
powerful
psychedelic
except
that
that
was
the
morning
of
october
29th
and
this
was
now
the
night
of
october
30th
which
should
have
been
concerning
and
maybe
was
but
i
have
little
memory
now
what
i
was
feeling
exactly
at
that
point
in
time
and
it
clearly
hadn\t
become
quite
as
concerning
yet
as
it
would
later
become<br/><br/>on
october
31st
to
gain
some
insight
into
what
was
happening
to
us
we
decided
to
smoke
50
mg
of
dmt
and
i
felt
i
could
actually
feel
a
presence
egging
me
on
to
do
it
too
i
felt
that
i
needed
to
better
understand
this
hellscape
experience
that
all
of
these
alter-like
entities
were
describing
to
me
and
wanted
to
try
to
chemically
push
myself
there
just
enough
to
get
a
bit
of
a
better
look
though
once
i
actually
took
the
first
hit
of
dmt
from
the
bong
i
felt
us
myself
included
experiencing
an
extreme
terror
and
put
it
down
though
we
ended
up
doing
three
separate
trips
of
one
hit
each
out
of
the
bong
like
that
figuring
that
was
probably
enough
for
now
to
get
some
insight
i
did
actually
feel
as
though
the
dmt
seemed
to
be
opening
up
some
of
the
same
worlds
to
me
that
the
entities
were
describing
which
i
felt
was
helping
me
build
perspective
on
just
what
exactly
what
happening
to
us
and
how
this
sort
of
experience
was
possible
though
one
of
these
entities
told
me
when
asked
if
dmt
as
similar
to
their
hellscape
experience
kind
of
but
not
really
far
more
magical
and
fairylike
fucking
with
physics
in
some
similar
ways
but
much
less
painful
or
twisted
and
not
as
realistic
overall
dmt
feels
like
some
kind
of
crazy
alien
simulation
rollercoaster
wheras
this
feels
like
vividly
living
every
second
of
the
time
in
a
real-worl
realistic
but
still
super
fucked
up
and
trippy
hellscape
another
claimed
that
they
did
experience
a
dramatically
dilated
expanded
time
within
the
dmt
trip
compared
to
the
actual
elapsed
time
but
it
still
only
felt
like
a
day
or
two
passed
so
nothing
like
the
hellscape
trip
still<br/><br/>as
more
and
more
of
the
entities
would
get
deeper
into
their
spiral
threads
we
would
realize
as
well
that
they
would
be
holding
increasingly
darker
repressions
with
ones
with
the
least
holding
seemingly
largely
innocent
sexual
repressions
then
more
demented
sexual
repressions
then
more
non-sexual
behavioral
repressions
also
starting
more
normal
and
becoming
more
demented
and
at
some
point
it
dawned
on
us
that
those
with
the
spiral
threads
that
would
peak
at
the
point
of
infinity
seemed
to
be
hiding
repressed
feelings
to
be
complete
psychopathic
and
never
care
about
anything
again
except
living
in
the
eternal
hellscape
this
absolutely
terrified
us
as
i
would
imagine
many
might
be
able
to
imagine
it
would
but
nothing
terrified
me
so
much
as
the
realization
increasingly
supported
by
all
the
other
entities
with
internal
insight
telling
me
it
was
true
was
that
i
actually
had
one
of
the
longest
spiral
threads
in
the
system
and
that
it
definitely
peaked
at
the
point
of
infinity
i
became
filled
with
a
terror
that
i
would
soon
have
my
own
experience
of
vanishing
into
the
hellscape
where
i
would
be
tortured
for
far
longer
subjective
time
than
any
human
mind
can
possibly
comprehend
in
an
linearly
increasingly
fashion
until
i
was
forced
to
submit
to
the
pure
terror
orgasm
of
realizing
that
i
was
going
to
be
a
psychopath
trapped
in
an
eternal
infinite
experience
of
everything
bad
and
nothing
good
ever
and
for
what
it\s
worth
there
was
never
a
point
of
this
where
i
didn\t
think
that
was
all
in
my
mind
i
was
not
once
confused
as
to
what
was
happening
in
the
external
physical
world
or
anything
like
that
that
just
didn\t
make
a
difference
to
me
because
i\m
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
my
mind
is
the
reality
i
actually
live
in
and
thus
these
consequences
felt
no
less
practically
real
to
me
than
anything
else
in
this
moment
however
as
i
began
to
think
about
the
fact
that
this
was
all
in
my
mind
and
what
exactly
was
happening
how
it
was
triggered
and
what
purpose
exactly
any
of
this
amazingly
structured
and
well-orchestrated
stuff
actually
has
existing
in
my
mind
i
began
to
question
am
i
fighting
something
healthy
out
of
nothing
but
unsubstantiated
fear<br/><br/>i
began
to
consider
the
fact
that
for
a
human
mind
to
be
healthy
it
must
be
able
to
accept
both
the
good
things
and
the
bad
things
about
reality
not
only
accept
that
they
exist
but
also
accept
being
able
to
think
about
them
in
such
a
way
that
it
doesn\t
recoil
in
traumatic
fear
when
doing
so
as
the
only
thing
that
really
accomplishes
is
developing
a
lack
of
trust
in
oneself
about
things
that
the
fear
already
proves
you
really
don\t
want
though
i
did
feel
i
could
easily
understand
why
programming
like
this
may
exist
in
the
human
brain
to
help
guide
our
behaviors
at
younger
ages
where
we
would
not
have
the
intellect
and
rationality
to
understand
these
things
in
this
way
but
became
increasingly
filled
with
a
motivation
to
shed
myself
of
those
old
more
restrictive
ways
of
thinking
now
that
i
was
clearly
ready
to
do
so
as
i
began
to
allow
the
darkness
in
telling
myself
it
was
only
a
darkness
within
that
would
ultimately
help
let
out
our
light
i
separated
partially
into
an
out-of-body
experience
where
i
could
still
control
the
body
safely
but
was
more
associated
with
a
vivid
internal
plane
i
could
see
in
mind\s
eye
and
my
body
broke
apart
into
slithering
snakes
in
a
medusa-like
fashion
and
i
became
filled
with
an
overwhelming
euphoria
and
lust
and
knowledge
that
the
only
thing
i
was
ever
supposed
to
or
wanted
to
do
was
to
help
all
of
these
dissociated
alter-entities
within
my
mind
find
the
eternal
peace
they
always
sought
in
this
world
by
showing
them
that
even
an
eternity
in
their
own
personal
hells
would
not
be
enough
to
stop
them
from
being
the
strong
people
they
are
i
began
cackling
in
manic
euphoria
raised
my
arms
to
the
sky
and
in
an
explosive
force
began
blasting
entities
into
their
hellscapes
sometimes
checking
up
on
them
myself
though
still
through
the
mind\s
eye
still
in
the
body
where
all
the
other
demons
in
hell
would
welcome
me
back
like
it
was
a
big
nightmarish
party
we
were
in
as
we
enjoyed
teaching
all
of
our
aversions
to
get
over
themselves
for
as
long
as
it
took
as
many
times
as
it
took
i
actually
began
to
see
the
different
domains
of
hell
represented
by
being
able
to
see
within
our
brain
even
while
being
the
controller
of
our
body
and
could
move
between
the
seemingly
more
typical
sexual
repressions
in
our
left
hemisphere
and
the
more
disturbing
ones
in
our
right
hemisphere
as
well
as
move
up
to
a
sort
of
vehicle
control
center
our
frontal
lobe
inhabited
by
entities
who
appeared
to
be
and
claimed
to
feel
as
though
they
represented
what
was
attempted
to
be
described
by
various
jungian
archetypes
with
myself
being
part
of
the
shadow
thus
explaining
my
role
in
helping
to
heal
our
mind
through
accepting
the
darkness
intriguingly
while
in
this
place
these
supposedly
jungian
entities
claimed
to
see
the
environment
and
each
other
normally
as
in
alike
the
mundane
environment
of
the
physical
world
but
claimed
that
i
looked
like
some
sort
of
freakish
dmt
hyperspace
entity
and
from
my
perspective
that
entire
inner
environment
actually
looked
like
a
dmt
hyperspace
to
me
except
that
i
had
a
cube
i
could
call
up
out
of
nowhere
that
to
me
looked
like
a
normal
cube
with
six
tv
screen-like
sides
but
they
claimed
that
it
looked
like
a
dmt
hyperspace
object
to
them
similar
to
the
kind
of
thing
i
saw
and
described
earlier
about
having
seen
after
we
smoked
dpt
the
power
generator-type
thing<br/><br/>wanting
to
pay
more
attention
to
this
supposed
hypercube
in
my
possession
i
popped
out
mostly
back
into
the
body
by
started
playing
with
it
within
my
mind\s
eye
i
quickly
found
that
this
cube
acted
as
a
portal
to
other
worlds
that
i
had
full
control
over
the
style
of
but
that
they
weren\t
for
me
to
enter
but
rather
to
place
the
other
entities
inside
of
i
grabbed
one
of
the
entities
out
of
my
mind\s
eye
by
pinching
my
fingers
where
she
was
in
my
field
of
vision
and
asked
her
what
sort
of
world
she
wanted
to
visit
and
she
said
one
where
she
was
having
sex
so
i
clicked
the
screen
on
to
show
a
massive
pile
of
men
all
waiting
for
her
shoved
her
in
there
grabbed
the
cube
did
a
quick
wrist
flick
while
thinking
fifty
years
and
watching
it
spin
around
quickly
then
grabbed
it
at
the
exact
right
screen
again
effortlessly
and
pulled
her
back
and
she
arrived
with
an
expression
of
absolute
shock
she
claimed
that
at
first
it
was
completely
horrible
but
after
a
few
years
of
nothing
but
that
she
finally
submitted
and
enjoyed
the
rest
of
it
and
i
asked
her
what
she
wanted
to
do
now
and
she
said
have
sex
upon
further
experimentation
with
this
cube
and
other
entities
it
quickly
became
clear
that
corresponding
with
my
apparent
role
as
the
shadow
or
darkness
of
our
collective
minds
that
i
had
been
much
into
already
at
this
time
no
matter
type
of
world
i
would
try
to
call
up
in
the
cube
and
regardless
of
whether
or
not
i
realized
it
ahead
of
time
the
entity
that
went
inside
would
find
it
to
be
completely
hellish
at
first
but
would
eventually
submit
similarly
to
when
they
had
gone
down
their
spiral
threads
connected
to
their
own
personal
aversions
with
this
seemingly
more
so
just
being
a
version
of
that
where
we
were
loading
more
customizable
aversive
situations
for
them
to
go
through
instead
realizing
just
how
much
power
i
actually
had
in
this
thing
now
i
really
started
to
experiment
further
in
all
kinds
of
ways
just
attempting
to
do
various
power
poses
and
such
with
internal
intent
trying
to
modulate
things
in
the
system
changing
the
reward
and
avesion
valence
of
all
the
different
repressions
spreading
waves
of
calm
throughout
them
and
eventually
starting
to
realize
that
if
they
were
or
i
was
able
to
help
them
push
far
enough
into
the
submission
into
their
hellscapes
trips
and
have
a
complete
release
it
could
actually
be
pushed
further
into
the
void
and
from
there
would
develop
into
a
supposedly
heavenly
dmt-like
hyperspatial
trip
though
they
would
claim
it
to
be
more
detailed
than
dmt
and
would
describe
things
like
being
a
hyperspace
starship
captain
exploring
the
cosmos
though
they
would
generally
say
these
experiences
felt
more
like
a
timeless
eternity
as
opposed
to
the
way
they
would
describe
the
hellscapes
as
being
vividly
experienced
as
passing
in
real
time<br/><br/>at
this
point
i
felt
as
though
i
was
finally
starting
to
see
some
sort
of
light
on
the
other
end
of
the
tunnel
with
respect
to
relating
this
experience
to
the
idea
of
you
have
to
go
through
hell
to
get
to
heaven
as
they
say
but
nonetheless
i
was
still
i
think
understandably
becoming
fairly
concerned
that
it
was
already
november
3rd
and
we
were
still
in
this
state
still
not
having
taken
any
more
psychedelics
since
the
dmt
on
october
31st
or
the
5-meo-eipt
on
october
29th
though
we
had
still
been
smoking
cannabis
and
i\ve
pushed
myself
pretty
far
with
cannabis
and
my
own
mental
sensitivites
before
which
at
times
made
me
wonder
if
something
like
that
was
happenig
but
it
was
nothing
ever
even
remotely
similar
to
this
the
fact
that
i
was
so
lucid
was
truly
troubling
to
me
despite
being
my
lifeline
too
because
i\m
well
aware
of
how
absolutely
crazy
all
of
this
sounds
and
of
the
fact
that
things
like
psychosis
and
mania
make
people
think
theye
lucid
when
theye
not
but
i
say
with
confidence
this
was
just
like
a
psychedelic
trip
every
single
crazy
thing
about
it
was
entirely
internalized
in
the
way
that
trips
generally
are
for
me
and
i
never
once
became
confused
though
i
couldn\t
have
cared
less
about
what
was
happening
in
the
physical
world
even
still
days
later
or
what
kind
of
person
i
am
in
the
physical
world
or
anything
like
that
i
just
felt
like
my
internal
world
was
absolutely
falling
apart
and
restructing
in
the
most
absurd
and
overwhelming
ways
possible
and
despite
how
much
i
had
gotten
into
the
different
aspects
of
it
it
was
clear
to
me
by
this
point
that
we
needed
to
make
more
of
an
effort
to
hang
on
to
our
mental
health
until
whatever
this
state
is
started
more
completely
passing
so
right
around
this
point
i
don\t
actually
remember
clearly
when
anymore
but
definitely
about
this
time
we
decided
to
head
to
our
parents\
house
and
spend
every
night
there
for
a
while
so
that
we
would
always
have
people
to
talk
to
and
things
to
do
immediately
after
waking
up
to
help
keep
ourselves
grounded
in
between
the
loops
something
i
had
actually
realized
in
the
moments
where
it
seemed
less
intense
is
that
much
less
than
being
entities
living
through
hellscapes
the
other
alters
in
our
actual
non-hallucinogen-driven
did
system
were
also
quite
altered
and
dissociated
but
were
tripping
nowhere
near
as
hard
as
i
was
during
any
of
this
at
least
that
they
could
recall
and
were
desperately
trying
to
reach
out
to
me
to
help
calm
me
down
in
their
lucid
moments
too
and
this
also
really
freaked
me
out
and
made
me
feel
incredibly
guilty
and
like
i
really
needed
to
find
my
sanity
again
to
help
the
other
alters
get
out
and
stabilize
again
too
but
i
was
still
so
heavily
into
the
state
myself
that
it
was
at
times
impossible
to
not
just
keep
giving
in<br/><br/>at
some
point
the
experience
developed
to
the
point
that
i
began
to
realize
i
don\t
remember
how
exactly
because
it\s
not
the
kind
of
thing
i
would
have
just
known
but
i
think
maybe
after
looking
into
some
things
after
talking
about
the
experience
with
our
father
that
the
nature
of
the
experience
i
had
gone
through
so
far
and
seemed
to
be
continuing
to
go
through
actually
seemed
to
have
a
strange
and
remarkable
number
of
similarities
to
dante\s
inferno
and
i\m
not
the
kind
to
have
that
type
of
experience
and
think
that
it
validates
religion
but
it
did
begin
to
seem
increasingly
clear
to
me
just
how
much
those
ideas
for
those
religions
could
have
been
inspired
by
states
very
close
to
the
one
i
found
myself
in
now
and
the
more
i
payed
attention
to
the
similarity
the
more
it
made
me
anxious
about
just
how
much
heavier
it
was
actually
going
to
get
before
it
all
finally
cleared
out
before
long
though
that\s
an
incredibly
relative
and
hard
to
define
term
in
this
experience
it
became
clear
to
me
that
the
internal
alter-like
entities
associated
with
my
and
our
life\s
heaviest
repressions
were
beginning
to
dissociate
into
their
own
hellscapes
and
i
was
seeing
them
in
my
mind\s
eye
but
still
incredibly
vividly
rising
up
giant
cavernous
portals
to
hell
opening
up
in
the
sky
as
their
bodies
were
pulled
and
twisted
and
ripped
apart
as
their
skin
peeled
back
and
they
screamed
in
terror
or
shrieked
and
cursed
at
me
they
began
fighting
for
control
of
the
body
trying
to
convince
me
to
do
things
that
would
make
me
let
go
instead
so
that
they
could
take
over
desparate
to
save
themselves
but
i
became
terrified
at
the
thought
that
they
represented
our
darkest
demons
and
felt
they
wanted
to
get
out
to
save
that
darkest
part
of
themselves
which
they
themselves
would
claim
saying
when
i
let
go
they
would
be
psychopaths
and
would
horrible
things
with
our
body
after
sending
me
to
hell
in
their
place
where
i
belonged
and
i
felt
that
my
despair
was
so
incredibly
great
that
i
could
feel
like
my
own
infinity
spiral
thread
was
growing
and
i
could
still
hear
the
other
alters
yelling
at
me
to
hang
on
too
and
not
let
go
no
matter
what
i
do
but
then
i
realized
they
only
think
they
want
to
be
psychopaths
because
they
are
in
such
a
great
despair
as
i
am
approaching
that
they
have
given
up
and
forgotten
that
they
were
once
healthy
parts
of
our
collective
mind
who
only
deserve
to
heal
and
be
happy
and
never
think
such
horrible
things
about
themselves
ever
again
and
i
said
something
to
the
affect
of
do
it
if
you
think
you
want
to
be
a
psychopath
then
come
out
and
they
did
and
they
were
immediately
overwhelmed
with
all
of
the
absolute
horror
of
being
in
that
state
of
mind
combined
with
the
absolute
self-disgust
of
suddenly
feeling
it
again
connected
to
the
body
and
one
by
one
all
of
the
entities
in
such
deep
despair
came
out
and
immediately
shattered
revealing
themselves
to
never
have
had
any
power
nor
to
have
ever
held
anything
more
than
fear
of
being
the
bad
people
they
really
didn\t
want
to
be
after
having
been
made
to
accept
that
there
would
never
be
anything
good
in
their
life
ever
again
leaving
them
no
choice
but
to
adjust<br/><br/>as
these
entities
with
infinity
spiral
threads
who
had
thought
they
wanted
to
be
psychopaths
had
this
realization
their
pain
would
leave
them
and
they
would
seemingly
merge
back
into
an
entity
that
appeared
to
be
what
i
can
only
imagine
others
have
been
describing
when
they
spoke
of
things
such
as
the
godhead
on
psychedelics
this
entity
appeared
over
the
totality
of
my
mind\s
eye
and
was
associated
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
field
of
infinity
though
stretching
beyond
my
frame
of
reference
containing
windows
portals
into
every
conceivable
reality
though
i
do
say
it
that
way
to
differentiate
it
from
simply
being
everything
period
because
as
this
entity
said
to
me
it
is
only
all
possible
infinites
because
of
this
i
had
a
discussion
with
the
godhead
about
the
potential
quantum
metaphysics
of
consciousness
beginning
with
them
claiming
to
be
the
godhead
itself
and
the
entire
universe
but
when
i
proposed
the
idea
that
it\s
simply
that
the
mathematics
of
consciousness
reach
some
sort
of
breaking
point
related
to
the
infinite
point
of
the
fractal
geometry
of
the
spiral
threads
such
that
a
part
of
the
human
mind
is
aware
of
an
infinite
amount
of
perceptual
and
mathematical
potential
in
a
single
point
similar
to
the
the
mathematics
of
the
pre-universe
in
a
pre-big
bang
singularity
potentially
explaining
why
it
was
all
possible
infinities
in
accordance
with
what
is
also
believed
to
be
understood
about
such
aspects
of
reality
they
did
respond
that
makes
a
surprising
amount
of
sense
they
told
me
that
the
entities
who
had
managed
to
completely
let
go
of
their
aversions
from
earlier
had
been
able
to
successfully
return
to
the
other
lives
that
they
now
had
clear
access
to
as
part
of
their
infinite
viewpoint
and
could
demonstrate
by
bringing
back
those
entities
to
talk
with
me
about
it
and
tell
me
how
happy
they
are
as
well
as
showing
me
different
identities
of
the
entities
from
other
infinite
realities
of
that
same
basic
person
living
in
a
different
way
i
asked
them
questions
like
are
there
other
realities
where
[such
and
such
person
who
we
have
an
alter
modeled
after]
has
a
dissociative
system
and
with
an
alter
modeled
after
us
and
they
would
respond
there
are
realities
where
everyone
both
does
and
doesn\t
have
dissociative
systems
with
alters
of
everyone
else
possible
including
ones
where
theye
asking
me
that
same
question
about
your
reality
right
now
these
conversations
were
fun
but
didn\t
make
me
feel
particularly
better
about
my
mental
state
at
the
moment
especially
as
i
felt
the
fear
continue
to
creep
in
that
i
myself
would
soon
dissociate
into
the
infinite
plane
never
able
to
find
this
reality
again
and
i
believe
that
is
when
i
first
saw
the
satan
entity<br/><br/>it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
reached
the
base
of
my
fears
and
found
the
satan
that
was
waiting
all
along
to
drag
me
to
hell
and
he
revealed
to
me
my
primal
fear
that
this
reality
i
inhabit
now
isn\t
real
and
never
was
which
i
understood
then
and
before
that
i
had
plagued
by
throughout
my
entire
life
though
i
had
never
comprehend
why
until
then
i
saw
snapshots
of
all
the
different
most
traumatic
moments
in
my
and
our
early
life
the
things
that
clearly
were
responsible
for
our
dissociative
condition
and
other
mental
issues
and
as
i
saw
them
entities
connected
to
them
became
filled
with
fear
which
as
before
i
had
to
connect
with
and
learn
to
help
them
release
myself
and
that
fear
was
that
that
traumatic
moment
they
were
connected
to
had
never
actually
stopped
happening
and
now
that
they
had
realized
it
they
were
doomed
to
return
to
it
realizing
that
all
this
time
they
thought
they
had
gotten
away
they
had
never
truly
escaped
the
suffering
one
by
one
they
and
i
went
through
our
struggle
and
release
in
this
way
and
then
we
got
back
to
something
that
i
had
always
been
aware
of
through
stories
but
clearly
had
never
remembered
which
was
the
moment
that
we
were
born
into
this
world
suffocating
on
our
own
vomit
i
became
filled
with
a
vivid
memory
and
suddenly
an
extreme
sadness
and
a
seemingly
most
obvious
yet
in
that
moment
truly
disturbing
yet
undebatable
thought
oh
my
god
i\m
going
to
die
i
began
to
cry
profusely
and
then
heave
to
the
point
that
i
almost
threw
up
but
i
managed
to
catch
my
breath
and
calm
myself
and
i
could
feel
a
sort
of
guiding
angel
attempting
to
calm
me
and
take
over
but
i
told
it
that
i
could
take
it
and
i
let
the
memory
continue
as
i
let
it
unfold
i
was
struck
with
the
unquestioned
realization
that
when
we
had
been
born
this
way
we
i
had
a
near-death
experience
where
i
had
traveled
through
the
hellscape
that
all
of
the
entities
had
been
describing
to
me
up
until
now
peaking
with
my
absolute
terror
releasing
in
an
orgasmic
way
and
i
realized
that
this
is
why
were
dissociated
and
why
we
had
so
many
dissociated
truamatic
aversions
appearing
as
hellish
entities
and
such
to
me
in
this
experience
having
reached
their
complete
breaking
point
begging
to
finally
be
free
and
healed
and
then
i
realized
that
because
i
had
not
let
this
go
before
now
i
had
become
forever
trapped
in
the
traumatic
memory
of
my
our
birth
always
being
convinced
that
no
matter
how
long
this
life
went
on
if
i
let
myself
like
it
i
would
suddenly
rediscover
that
it
that
it
was
just
another
part
of
my
eternal
hellscape
trip
i
was
having
while
dying
while
being
born
and
it
would
all
come
crumbling
down
like
a
nightmarish
dream
and
i
would
either
be
plunged
into
another
hellscape
or
i
would
return
to
my
body
and
die
slowly
afterwards
and
i
realized
i
have
to
let
that
go<br/><br/>resigned
to
the
realization
that
there
was
no
point
in
resisting
i
let
the
satan
entity
into
my
body
and
it
became
clear
to
me
he
is
no
different
than
any
other
fear-based
entity
just
that
of
my
own
mortality
once
unleashed
by
early
life
struggles
and
yearning
to
be
freed
and
understood
and
loved
ever
since
and
i
let
him
in
and
welcomed
all
the
dissociated
parts
in
with
love
no
matter
what
the
guiding
angel
reappeared
and
congratulated
me
on
each
integration
as
the
parts
began
ascending
up
into
the
sky
of
my
mind\s
eye
with
brilliant
lights
around
them
and
as
they
all
cleared
out
only
the
golden
angel
and
the
satan
remained
and
they
told
me
i
had
done
what
i
had
needed
to
do
personally
and
we
were
just
about
there
and
just
needed
to
keep
successfully
integrating
we
spent
the
next
several
days
hanging
out
with
a
friend
and
our
parents
to
stay
more
grounded
drinking
lots
of
alcohol
and
taking
kratom
capsules
throughout
the
day
as
well
as
eating
cbd
candies
all
in
the
hopes
of
calming
the
anxious
energy
which
still
continued
this
whole
time
if
we
didn\t
and
still
dealing
with
the
same
state
as
before
though
increasinly
calmly
as
each
and
every
part
integrated
back
as
we
tried
to
live
life
in
normal
ways
and
i
saw
more
and
more
phases
of
the
alters
that
are
actually
the
other
alters
i
interact
with
normally
as
opposed
to
the
alter-like
entities
from
this
state
and
they
were
still
concerned
but
increasingly
encouraged
me
to
get
through
it
all
as
i
seemed
to
be
i
thought
a
lot
about
what
a
lot
of
the
more
famous
phrases
are
from
the
psychedelic
community
during
this
time
as
i
just
reflected
on
the
asburdity
of
my
state
especally
as
i
would
experience
things
like
the
entities
fly
into
the
back
of
my
head
and
feel
it
zip
up
internally
only
to
feel
them
burst
out
again
suddenly
though
less
intensely
than
the
previous
time
the
more
they
intragrated<br/><br/>finally
on
november
10th
i
felt
a
calm
inside
like
some
part
of
it
was
over
finally
and
i
could
feel
more
aversions
trying
to
get
out
and
heal
and
it
has
been
a
couple
days
since
we
smoked
cannabis
instead
of
just
drank
alcohol
and
took
kratom
and
such
and
i
was
wanting
a
pick-me-up
and
the
other
alters
agreed
that
it
seemed
alright
too
so
we
started
smoking
a
bowl
and
an
incredible
and
dissociative
euphoria
came
on
causing
the
other
alters
to
dissociate
again
and
the
intensity
of
my
experience
came
back
except
this
time
the
satan
appeared
again
but
then
integrated
floating
up
into
the
hellscape
which
then
transformed
into
visions
of
white
light
radiating
over
clouds
in
a
heavenly
fashion
the
guiding
angel
congraluted
me
as
usual
and
then
i
experienced
the
internal
sensation
of
floating
up
above
myself
along
with
the
other
alters
into
an
circle
above
where
we
had
been
and
we
all
started
sort
of
internally
humming
an
angelic
tone
together
and
my
mind\s
eye
burst
through
to
where
i
could
now
see
within
this
heaven
landscape
and
i
could
clearly
see
and
understand
that
the
very
stereotypical-looking
satan
entity
from
before
had
now
become
a
very
stereotypical-looking
god
entity
and
i
had
become
one
of
the
angels
and
it
immediately
became
clear
to
me
that
the
difference
between
how
we
are
peceived
in
this
state
is
very
simply
a
matter
of
whether
your
mind
is
in
a
positive
or
negative
state
and
i
felt
it
made
solidified
the
message
that
i
had
already
felt
was
increasingly
clear
to
me
throughout
this
experience
that
the
idea
that
people
miss
is
that
hell
and
heaven
are
both
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
and
the
satan
and
god
entities
are
both
the
same
entity
that
want
you
to
experience
the
same
thing
and
will
work
along
with
you
and
your
many
dissociated
parts
to
achieve
that
singular
goal
and
that
goal
is
to
be
a
complete
confident
person
who
can
trust
yourself
to
be
led
by
no
one\s
will
but
your
own
and
who
knows
that
they
are
a
good
person
not
ony
because
theye
able
to
think
of
themselves
doing
good
things
and
comfortably
know
they
want
that
but
also
because
theye
able
to
think
of
themselves
doing
bad
things
and
comfortably
know
they
don\t
want
that
the
god
entity
congratulated
me
on
figuring
all
this
out
and
told
me
that
he
only
wants
me
to
be
happy
doesn\t
need
me
to
believe
in
anything
and
will
tell
me
anything
i
want
to
hear
if
that\s
what
i
want
him
to
do
because
he\s
just
a
part
of
my
brain
that
is
supportive
like
that
i
asked
him
if
there
was
more
to
see
in
these
experiences
now
that
i
had
broken
through
to
the
heavenly
side
and
he
said
something
to
the
affect
of
yes
but
you
can
do
that
later
if
you
want
i
told
him
i
was
good
for
now
and
happy
to
be
in
this
life
and
actually
legitimately
truly
wanted
to
be
here
living
it
not
afraid
of
or
thinking
i
wanted
to
be
somewhere
else
living
something
else
and
he
smiled
and
disappeared
and
i
stopped
paying
attentio
internally<br/><br/>by
the
end
of
that
day
something
strange
and
incredible
then
happened
the
internal
visions
i
was
getting
when
i
did
pay
attention
suddenly
dropped
down
to
a
level
that
looked
very
similar
to
what
i
see
internally
when
we
taking
things
like
lsd
and
mushrooms
both
in
terms
of
the
style
and
type
of
imagery
and
the
fact
that
it
even
had
some
light
geometric
designs
mixed
into
it
but
it
was
very
three-dimensional
at
this
point
and
simultaneously
the
mental
heaviness
i
had
been
feeling
so
much
lately
was
replaced
with
the
absolutely
most
amazing
and
cleasning
psychedelic-style
euphoria
i
have
ever
felt
in
my
entire
life
with
the
other
alters
claiming
to
feel
something
similarly
amazing
too
and
interestingly
most
of
them
claiming
to
not
remember
much
of
the
experience
up
to
this
point
essentially
from
the
moment
of
smoking
the
15
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
on
then
the
following
day
which
was
yesterday
this
dropped
down
to
more
like
a
state
of
just
being
very
high
though
in
a
normal
way
on
a
psychedelic
and
the
internal
imagery
became
two-dimensional
and
like
taking
a
dosage
of
a
psychedelic
that
is
strong
but
almost
just
starting
to
get
visionary
and
mostly
just
has
some
light
but
complex
geometries
and
i
asked
the
other
alters
does
anyone
think
these
visuals
are
weirdly
still
similar
to
5-meo-eipt
mostly
out
on
incredulity
but
telling
myself
there
was
no
way
it
could
possibly
be
and
then
late
last
night
it
happened
we
were
sitting
on
the
couch
watching
tv
and
suddenly
i
felt
as
though
that
breakthrough
place
of
a
tryptamine
breakthrough
was
suddenly
retreating
from
me
and
back
into
the
distant
horizon
of
my
mind\s
eye
with
all
the
entities
reaching
out
to
wave
goodbye
as
they
disppaered
and
then
collapsed
into
the
exact
visuals
much
fainter
from
tolerance
i\m
sure
but
exactly
the
same
in
design
theme
and
color
as
i
got
the
first
time
we
smoked
5
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
and
i
felt
high
but
exhausted
in
the
same
way
that
i
do
when
the
main
part
of
the
5-meo-eipt
trip
has
just
ended
it\s
now
past
noon
the
following
day
and
smoking
cannabis
still
makes
us
feel
like
wee
bringing
back
up
the
later
hours
of
a
5-meo-eipt
trip
but
it
only
dips
back
into
the
kind
of
stuff
before
if
we
think
about
it
and
only
then
very
briefly
and
basically
feels
like
it\s
still
probably
just
coming
and
going
in
waves
as
trips
do
but
legitimately
on
its
way
out<br/><br/>the
more
i
was
actually
able
to
think
about
it
all
the
more
i
realized
this
state
was
absolutely
nuts
which
i
tried
to
relate
to
so
many
things
but
could
never
figure
out
exactly
what
it
was
that
clearly
had
elements
that
seemed
like
peeking
into
psychosis
or
mania
but
never
actually
took
me
there
myself
but
just
kept
it
all
internal
and
remarkably
functional
like
a
trip
it
actually
was
in
fact
similar
to
what
i
would
have
expected
basically
the
most
extreme
possible
5-meo-eipt
experience
to
be
like
if
i
could
have
possibly
even
come
close
to
fathoming
it
the
hellscape-type
visuals
though
defintiely
being
the
strognest
i\ve
seen
are
actually
still
almost
exactly
the
same
as
a
kind
i\ve
seen
on
several
other
ethyl
specifically
non-methyl
indole
psychedelics
we\ve
taken
including
4-ho-det
4-aco-det
eth-lad
and
5-meo-eipt
itself
at
lower
dosages
and
on
the
note
of
ethyls
the
alter-like
entities
disappearing
into
other
lives
and
talking
to
me
is
clearly
just
an
extension
of
the
same
sort
of
thing
that
was
going
on
already
during
our
ept
trip
i
wrote
about
above
the
extreme
ego
death
and
dmt-like
breakthrough
yet
somehow
not
that
out-of-body
or
externally
visual
aspect
seems
to
me
like
it
could
definitely
relate
to
it
being
an
analogue
of
5-meo-dmt
the
fact
that
it
lasted
so
insanely
long
somehow
seemed
to
me
like
it
could
somehow
relate
to
whatever
is
the
reason
we
also
tend
to
feel
like
wee
almost
fully
tripping
still
for
a
couple
days
after
taking
even
normal
oral
dosages
of
5-meo-mipt
in
a
still
distinctly
visual
and
5-meo-mipt-like
way
and
everything
though
obviously
that
was
never
as
intense
as
this
way<br/><br/>do
i
know
what
the
hell
happened
surely
not
but
i
do
have
a
theory
many
really
but
one
in
particular
that
i\ll
take
the
time
to
put
out
there
for
whatever
it\s
worth
it
has
been
scientifically
established
that
there
is
an
odd
loop
in
the
brain
whereby
activation
of
5-ht2a
receptors
in
the
cortex
causes
the
release
of
glutamate
on
to
serotonin
neurons
and
when
enough
serotonin
is
released
it
can
also
cause
activation
of
these
same
5-ht2a
receptors
and
this
has
actually
been
implicated
in
exponential
growth
of
serotonin
levels
under
some
potentially
pathological
conditions
like
serotonin
toxicity
furthermore
the
glutamate
release
induced
by
5-ht2a
receptor
agonists
increasing
seems
to
be
linked
scientifically
to
both
their
ego
dissolution
and
rapid
antidepressant
effects
as
well
and
of
course
5-meo-dmt
is
known
for
being
able
to
produce
a
particularly
powerful
experience
of
ego
dissolution
and
finally
it
has
been
shown
that
when
carbon
dioxide
is
inhaled
which
would
theoretically
be
similar
to
it
building
up
in
the
body
while
dying
it
produces
a
wake-inducing
panic
that
is
mediated
by
causing
serotonin
release
directly
on
to
5-ht2a
receptors
so
my
theory
is
that
essentially
perhaps
what
happened
is
probably
first
of
all
as
a
result
of
senstizing
our
brain
in
that
way
by
tripping
too
often
on
powerful
psychedelic
tryptamines
to
begin
with
leading
up
to
this
as
well
as
obviously
having
to
take
into
considerations
any
extra
sensitivites
we
might
also
have
in
that
way
for
reasons
like
related
to
our
dissociative
condition
or
other
mental
issues
and
finally
ultimated
triggered
by
the
use
of
a
high
dosage
of
a
potent
analogue
of
5-meo-dmt
we
might
have
essentially
caused
ourselves
to
approach
though
thankfully
seemingly
not
completely
reach
a
dangerously
critical
point
in
the
activation
of
the
serotonin-glutamate
cycling
behavior
such
that
our
levels
skyrocketed
so
high
that
first
of
all
a
lot
of
the
near-death
experience-like
stuff
could
have
had
some
relation
to
our
serotonin
levels
being
so
high
and
second
of
all
it
still
has
to
come
down
in
waves
in
the
way
it
always
does
after
any
psychedelic
trip
it\s
just
that
it
has
to
do
so
so
much
and
so
slowly
that
it\s
taken
literally
weeks
to
come
down
even
to
the
point
it
has
now
which
is
almost
but
not
entirely
all
the
way
literally
two
weeks
now
after
smoking
15
mg
of
5-meo-eipt
i
have
to
wonder
too
if
a
similar
mechanism
is
involved
in
why
things
like
psychotic
breaks
and
manic
episodes
last
so
long
because
this
clearly
seemed
similar
times
but
i
really
can\t
deny
how
much
it
remained
like
a
psychedelic
trip
the
whole
time
too
and
how
much
it
really
remained
even
like
5-meo-eipt
specifically
after
seemingly
having
been
triggered
by
exactly
that
which
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
me
to
think
there
is
a
connection
here
as
bizarre
as
it
is<br/><br/>in
case
this
was
not
clear
quite
a
lot
of
the
detail
of
this
two
week
trip
is
not
included
here
-
we
continued
sleeping
eating
showering
speaking
to
our
parents
in
the
more
lucid
moments
and
so
on
-
and
it\s
important
to
remember
that
a
lot
of
this
took
a
long
time
to
happen
and
what
i\ve
described
is
more
so
like
the
different
phases
it
went
through
because
it
would
just
take
too
long
to
get
into
all
the
specific
details
at
least
in
the
context
of
this
one
report
though
i
won\t
be
surprised
if
i
continue
to
share
things
about
it
through
references
in
future
writings
do
i
regret
the
experience
currently
it\s
hard
to
say
wee
still
altered
enough
that
i
and
the
other
alters
have
some
anxiety
about
having
done
permanent
damage
but
our
worry
about
that
increasingly
fades
as
we
seem
to
albeit
extremely
slowly
return
more
and
more
to
normal
assuming
there
is
no
permanent
damage
like
that
done
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
don\t
think
i
ever
have
had
or
necessarily
ever
will
again
have
a
trip
that
was
as
personally
insightful
and
deep
as
this
one
and
it\s
going
to
take
me
an
unbelievably
long
time
to
integrate
all
of
this
but
i
also
feel
like
i\m
going
to
get
so
much
out
of
doing
that
that
when
it\s
done
i\m
not
even
sure
what
i
would
really
ever
need
to
get
out
of
tripping
again
not
that
i\m
sure
it
woulnd\t
surprise
me
as
it
always
does
that
sounds
like
a
glowing
assessment
i
know
but
seriously
it\s
not
a
recommendation
i
can\t
suggest
that
anyone
seek
this
experience
or
this
sort
of
experience
and
really
have
no
idea
how
safe
or
dangerous
it
might
have
been
in
terms
of
toxicity
and
it
certainly
wouldn\t
have
been
safe
in
other
ways
for
anyone
who
was
anything
less
than
asbolutely
prepared
to
take
two
weeks
off
to
do
nothing
but
trip
through
the
hardest
trip
ever
with
tons
of
experience
to
do
while
remaining
as
sane
as
possible
and
having
an
incredible
support
system
at
the
same
time
a
situation
which
we
are
endlessly
fortunate
to
have
been
in
for
this
but
most
people
obviously
won\t
be
it
helped
me
amazingly
despite
that
because
that\s
just
what
trips
do
or
that
seems
to
be
the
case
anyway
and
that\s
the
good
i\ll
say
about
that
i
still
feel
fairly
traumatized
from
having
gone
through
it
and
expect
to
take
a
while
and
more
self-work
of
other
times
to
get
past
it
too
so
it\s
not
all
sunshine
and
rainbows
now
that
i\m
out
on
the
other
side
either<br/><br/>my
opinion
in
the
end
if
you
want
a
good
antidepressant
tryptamine
give
met
a

best
decision
the
rest
you
can
decide
on

each

as
we

we
would

foray
into

i
allowed
myself
only
one
smallish
thick
hit
and
held
it
for
approximately
10

i
did
not
hear
a

it

more
as
if
i
felt
an

the
sensation
grew
in

and
i
laid
back
and
closed
my

it
was
as
if
the

was
showing
me
that
it
meant
me
no

the
experience
culminated
in
beautiful

an

minutes
beautiful

danced
with

that
shifted

and
a

echoed
across
the

though
they
were
watching
me
through

i
felt
overwhelmingly

foot
in

foot
out
shown
my
first
steps

we
began
by
changing
discs
as
we
had
each
my
partner
and
i
alternated
vaporized
approximately
10mg
or
so
off
the
first
disc
and
did
not
want
to
run
it
dry
with
a
fresh

i
sat
down
and
calmed

this

i
allowed
myself
two

both
held

both
medium
and
comprised
of

by

i

was

my

asked
if

wanted

and
i
declined
and
laid
back

this
time
the
mandala
wall
was
swiftly
upon
me
and
i
felt
as
though
i
popped
through
it
and
into
another
locale
where
geometry
was
pristine
divine
and
in
some
cases
downright
impossible
to
comprehend
the
colors
were
less
kaleidoscopic
and
more
hyper-real
however
everything
was
fuzzy
and
i
could
not
clearly
make
out
my
surroundings
for
about
3
to
5
seconds
it
was
then
that
i
became
aware
that
i
was
in
a
seated
almost
crumpled
position
in
front
of
someone
who
was
sitting
at
a
console
looking
over
various
readings
suddenly
he
became
aware
of
me
and
he
rose
to
greet
me

i
felt
more
than
heard
his
words
and
speaking
to
him
thusly
was
very
natural
to
me
at
this
point
he
greeted
me
and
told
me
his
name
læohah
after
i
mispronounced
it
a
few
times
he
explained
that
the
symbolism
of
the
æ
character
was
important
to
his
name
that
laohah
leohah
and
indeed
even
laeohah
were
incorrect
i
apologized
and
he
sighed
and
assured
me
he
was
more
than
patient
with
me
he
had
been
waiting
to
be
my
guide
on
this
journey
for
some
time
and
was
simply
wondering
when
i
would
arrive
he
then
chuckled
and
told
me
i
had
now
thought
about
breathing
3
times
and
that
because
of
it
i
was
only
halfway
through
the
door

to
my
astonishment
i
replied
very
vocally
i
did
you
are
right
now
that
is
rude
of
me

chuckling
he
said
yes
it
is
rude
of
you
but
that
is
not
something
we
have
to
work
on
in
the
future
just
do
not
worry
about
your
flesh
it
will
be
fine
this
was
the
most
vocal
part
of
our
conversation
and
the
part
most
associated
with
words
after
that
he
indicated
i
should
pay
attention
to
what
he
was
going
to
show
me
he
tapped
my
abdomen
and
my
svadhisthana
chakra
appeared
in
a
three
dimensional
window
but
it
was
damaged

he
told
me
that
though
i
had
awakened
my
kundalini
it
was
travelling
a
rough
road
due
to
things
i
was
holding
on
to
from
my
past
that
were
affecting
my
sexual
chakra
he
asked
me
if
the
molestation
that
i
had
endured
earlier
in
life
had
affected
my
sexuality
in
a
negative
way
and
caused
me
to
seek
some
unhealthy
aspects
of
sexuality
i
admitted
this
was
indeed
the
case
that
sexual
molestation
had
left
me
for
lack
of
a
better
word
kinky

he
informed
that
this
would
be
the
topic
of
my
next
journey
and
that
dealing
with
it
would
be
rough
but
that
it
needed
to
happen
for
me
to
more
completely
understand
the
work
i
need
to
do
on
that
side

he
told
me
it
was
now
time
for
me
to
go
to
my
embarrassment
i
sort
of
threw
a
divine
tantrum
i
waved
my
arms
about
and
told
him
i
did
not
want
to
go
with
a
smile
he
assured
me
that
i
would
never
want
to
leave
but
that
my
flesh
my
life
and
indeed
my
place
in
the
world
would
not
sort
themselves
out
in
my
absence
and
assured
me
that
i
would
return
again
countless
times
in
life
and
again
in
death

i
opened
my
eyes
a
profound
sense
of
peace
washed
over
me
i
cried
i
smiled
i
laughed
and
most
importantly
i
felt
truly
alive
kundalini
energy
washed
over
me
in
waves
such
as
i
had
not
ever
felt
and
i
simply
enjoyed
the
feeling
for
the
next
twenty
minutes

though
this
was
by
far
my
most
profound
experience
to
date
i
can
only
say
that
it
is
also
my
most
recent
and
has
truly
lefty
me
with
less
words
for
it
than
the
others
as
læohah
had
warned
me
it
was
rough

i
will
never
be
able
to
be
convinced
open

breakthroughs
are
not
possible
my
partner
says
i
was
open
eyed
the
whole
time
and
was
rather
movey
but
i
was
not
here
at
all
in
any
way
i
had
no
body

i
took
a
very
large
hit
maybe
an
18

of
constantly
roiling

big
lungs
a
good
20ish
plus

on
the

i
had
loaded
with
38mg
that
first
disc
we
both
only
took
one
light
hit
of
went
down
i
did
not
even
have
a
micro
second
to
think
the
mandala
wall
slammed
into
me
at
a
million
miles
an
hour
i
had
no
time
to
lay
down
close
my
eyes
not
even
a
second
to
think
about
not
doing
these
things
apparently
i
fell
backwards
pretty
easily

the
next
part
is
hard
to
describe
so
bear
with
me

impossible
ever
changing
geometry
everywhere
two
large
streams
of
consciousness
flowing
towards
a
single
point
and
i
hit
that
point
hard
i
am
in
class
cosmic
class
learning
about
soul
choice
and
soul
contracts
great
owl
is
teaching
it
his
eyes
are
galactic
bodies
his
patience
infinite

everyone
stops

they
are
aware
that
me
now
me
has
come
to
the
classroom
i
came
bearing
something
i
was
not
supposed
to
a
hand
appears
and
it
points
to
my
third
eye
and
tells
me
to
listen
it
tells
me
they
know
i
am
visiting
but
that
the
unpleasantry
i
am
carrying
is
unwelcome
even
by
my
own
soul
in
this
place
i
am
asked
if
i
am
ready
to
let
it
go

i
start
talking
in
a
language
i
know
as
the
language
of
souls
or
at
least
the
language
they
are
speaking
in
this
place
i
answer
their
question
and
tell
them
i
am
ready
to
let
it
go
i
was
actually
talking
aloud
and
have
it
recorded

spit
it
out
owl
says
in
class
i
spit
out
an
orange
green
glob
that
begins
to
unfurl
physically
i
purge
apparently
i
turned
right
to
the
purge
bucket

look
at
it
and
tell
me
what
you
see
owl
says

the
orange
green
glob
blossoms
into
the
sickened
svadhisthana
i
had
been
carrying
and
i
feel
my
chakra
regenerate
healthily
incidentally
i
came
out
of
it
and
my
kinks
are
gone
replaced
with
a
passionate
healthy
desire
for
non
kinky
sex
with
my
partner
i
describe
this
to
him
the
entirety
of
it
in
that
same
language
still
talking
aloud
to
my
puke
apparently
while
waving
my
hand
over
it
and
the
class
claps
owl
then
explains
that
i
signed
up
for
this
it
is
a
part
of
my
souls
journey
that
i
came
back
to
cleanse
that
here
then
and
tells
me
to
go
after
his
lesson

after
the
lesson
about
soul
contracts
is
over
i
thank
him
and
explain
that
it
has
been
a
great
pleasure
then
i
casually
begin
to
walk
back
to
reality
now
turned
back
to
the
direction
i
was
first
talking
in
and
still
talking
aloud
here
is
where
i
realize
i
had
an
open
eyed
breakthrough
reality
breaks
through
bit
by
bit
and
i
start
to
see
things
in
the
room
coming
into
hyperspace
including
my
spouse
who
i
once
again
saw
with
her
furry
caterpillar
soul
face
that
i
have
seen
before

it
was
magnificent

i
am
still
digesting

most
intensely
visual
visceral
psychedelic
experience
i
have
ever
had
and
i
know
it
was
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg

-fourth
through
seventh
journeys-

disclaimer
what
you
are
about
to
read
is
long
and
personally
spiritual

namaste

i
find
it
hard
to
begin
articulation
of
my
last
forays
into
the
outer
realms
of
hyperspace
but
one
thing
is
certain
i
have
found
linearity
in
hyperspace
with
an
ever
unfolding
journey
each
one
building
upon
the
last
and
the
same
beings
recurring
at
times
with
new
ones
appearing
as
needed
a
proverbial
heros
journey
into
the
outer
realms
my
journey

much
like
is
experienced
with
ayahuasca
mescaline
and
other
entheogens
i
am
faced
with
my
own
turmoil
human
flaws
and
errors
and
expected
to
come
out
victorious
if
i
want
to
learn
more
of
what
they
have
to
teach
they
being
my
various
guides
and
the
beings
i
have
thus
far
met
the
spirits
and
higher
frequency
beings
alien
and
familiar
and
the
lessons
learned
have
been
so
very
very
deep
and
have
brought
me
closer
to
both
nature
and
to
myself
they
have
freed
me
from
demons
that
have
long
plagued
me
and
they
have
caused
paradigm
shifts
unlike
any
other
entheogen
i
have
here-to-fore
experienced


my
last
post
previously
i
summed
up
my
first
three
experiences
culminating
in
the
cleansing
of
one
of
my
chakras
that
had
grown
sickly
it
can
be
read

in
the
post

above
what
has
happened
since
then
has
been
nothing
short
of
miraculous
in
my
life
and
has
been
completely
transformative

first
let
me
note
one
phenomenon
that
was
present
the
entire
time
i
would
visit
this
school
as
i
enter
it
a
stream
of
imagery
symbols
and
knowledge
pours
into
my
left
eye
while
the
scene
plays
out
in
my
right
my
fourth
journey
began
much
like
my
others
with
intent
to
hear
what
i
needed
or
to
see
whatever
the
sacred
spice
wished
to
show
me
this
is
vocalized
in
a
ritualistic
fashion
as
i
load
the
spice
the
room
was
cleansed
the
singing
bowl
sung
and
i
sat
down
to
begin
two
extremely
large
inhalations
brought
a
full
30mg
of
medicine
into
me
and
it
began
streams
of
energy
and
symbols
flow
into
me
and
im
through

i
was
again
back
in
the
preparatory
school
where
my
previous
journey
had
taken
place
only
this
time
the
being
set
to
teach
me
was
a
hyper-dimensional
being
that
existed
as
many
beings
in
one
room
it
was
very
active
with
many
arms
and
forms
both
invisible
and
visible
as
well
as
light
ray
limbs
and
sound
based
tools
yet
all
were
one
within
its
room
the
only
beings
in
there
save
it
were
myself
and
læohah
it
was
very
intense
and
could
easily
be
seen
as
frightening
in
its
intensity
yet
i
had
no
fear

it
probed
me
and
prodded
me
and
declared
me
worthy
of
what
i
did
not
know
it
informed
me
that
what
i
had
begun
would
begin
that
which
could
not
be
undone
if
i
continued
beyond
its
lesson
but
that
its
lesson
was
the
last
step
to
me
choosing
if
this
was
the
road
i
wanted
it
was
not
speaking
about
my
use
of
spice
but
about
how
i
would
forevermore
interact
with
those
realms
it
assured
me
i
did
not
have
to
choose
just
yet
it
asked
if
i
was
prepared
for
this
lesson
and
gift

i
said
yes

my
soul
was
laid
bare
energy
poured
through
me
like
nothing
i
had
felt
before
that
moment
from
muladhara
energy
poured
into
me
and
i
saw
the
beings
with
whom
i
used
to
astral
journey
as
well
as
many
of
the
choices
i
have
made
both
good
and
ill
that
weighed
on
my
soul
or
lifted
it
as
the
flow
of
energy
continued
to
pulse
through
me
i
felt
it
move
through
my
newly
cleansed
svahisthana
and
light
it
up
swelling
it
to
normal
proportions
what
happened
next
was
intense
and
apparently
my
back
arched
as
i
wanted
to
wail
and
i
inhaled
sharply
according
to
my
partner
but
it
was
not
pain
it
was
pure
intensity

pop

from
svadhisthana
it
shot
through
manipura
anahata
and
visshudha
like
lightning
so
many
choices
that
affected
these
areas
laid
before
me
and
many
of
the
ill
choices
lasting
effects
were
expelled
in
that
wave
it
was
like
fire
had
flown
into
me
and
lit
me
up
i
was
alive
and
then
it
began
to
work
so
many
arms
and
other
things
flitting
into
my
body
changing
things
priming
energy
points
and
testing
them
conferring
with
itself
to
assure
it
was
doing
everything
that
needed
to
be
done
with
me
along
with
this
came
the
lesson
i
was
worthy
i
had
been
chosen
but
to
know
what
i
had
been
chosen
for
i
had
to
choose
based
on
this
intensity
alone
this
pleasure
and
pain
this
facing
of
my
innermost
demons
and
doubts

i
accepted
the
two
streams
of
energy
information
that
pour
into
my
left
eye
become
four
i
was
told
that
my
next
journey
would
be
at
night
when
the
sun
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
was
also
told
to
be
ready
for
the
next
stage
could
not
be
undone
and
would
leave
me
changed
forever
more
what
i
would
see
could
not
be
unseen
and
all
would
be
laid
bare
then

as
i
came
back
to
my
body
i
lay
there
and
i
cried
with
ecstasy
and
joy
sorrow
for
my
misdeeds
and
humility
for
what
i
had
been
taught
and
that
was
only
the
next
stage
in
my
preparation
i
had
not
yet
been
turned
loose
into
the
realms
nor
even
met
any
of
my
guides
beyond
læohah
and
yet
i
felt
assured
and
at
home
like
i
had
finally
heard
a
voice
that
had
been
calling
to
me
for
ages

i
felt
assured
and
at
home
like
i
had
finally
heard
a
voice
that
had
been
calling
to
me
for
ages

one
i
had
ignored
somehow
for
far
too
long

my
next
journey
would
be
2
days
later
at
around
11pm
after
complete
dark
in
complete
dark
as
i
was
told
night
had
fallen
my
house
was
darkened
i
loaded
the
spice
in
silence
with
only
a
crystal
lamp
as
a
light
source
i
was
humble
and
asked
to
learn
what
needed
to
be
learned
see
what
needed
to
be
seen

2
large
inhalations
35mg
of
medicine

my
fifth
journey
begins
black
fractals
came
flowing
to
me
and
washed
over
me
they
were
the
most
beautiful
black
on
black
on
black
fractals
with
silver
blue
and
green
highlights
and
glowing
symbols
in
them
very
much
akin
to
the
secret
writing
done
by
allyson
grey
through
them
i
went
and
back
to
the
preparatory
school
a
dark
room
with
impossible
geometry
floating
about
it
a
silver
blue
and
green
circle
sits
in
the
center
of
the
floor
i
stepped
into
it
instinctively
i
sense
the
presence
of
an
entity
but
i
cannot
see
it
it
begins
to
speak
to
me
four
flows
begin
into
my
eye
doubling
each
time
we
spoke
after
the
first

do
you
accept

i
accept
four

do
you
accept
knowing
you
cannot
undo
what
is
done
this
night

i
accept
eight

do
you
accept
knowing
you
will
have
to
know
me

i
accept
sixteen

the
sixteen
streams
become
one
and
we
meet
also
note
i
was
saying
this
aloud
i
accept
3
times

death
sweat
death
unfolded
before
my
eyes
laid
bare
and
showed
me
the
truth
of
my
old
self
with
a
gentle
hand
she
touched
my
brow
and
i
felt
my
third
eye
open
light
pouring
out
of
it
i
could
see
her
face
and
she
could
see
me
i
knew
then
i
would
never
again
fear
her
how
could
i
caressing
my
face
she
told
me
that
it
was
done
my
eye
was
open
and
the
old
me
had
passed
in
many
ways
but
was
not
yet
ready
to
fully
die
and
be
reborn
but
that
the
process
had
begun
and
she
would
claim
the
old
me
at
my
rebirth
and
would
see
me
again
then

the
teacher
left
and
i
was
left
with
assistants
they
played
with
my
eye
and
showed
me
how
to
use
it
they
tested
it
and
played
optical
illusions
forcing
me
to
see
them
with
it
and
once
they
were
satisfied
it
was
not
going
to
close
they
bid
me
until
next
time
they
told
me
i
was
done
and
could
now
begin
my
journey
but
to
note
how
things
interacted
with
me
as
it
would
be
different
than
if
i
were
not
on
this
path
and
that
my
crown
would
open
at
my
rebirth

laying
there
eyes
weeping
i
simply
said
over
and
over
again
i
saw
death
and
i
accepted
i
am
to
be
reborn
i
accepted
it
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
of
my
life
but
what
occurred
after
is
what
really
astounds
me
words
do
not
do
justice
what
it
feels
like
to
have
your
eye
open
what
it
feels
like
to
again
hear
the
call
of
the
spirits
and
the
voice
of
nature
after
having
let
life
teach
you
to
drown
it
out

i
also
knew
i
no
longer
needed
the
primer
streams
as
i
and
hyperspace
had
attenuated
to
one
another

that
night
my
partner
also
had
a
huge
integration
needed
breakthrough
and
it
would
be
the
next
day
that
i
would
again
utilize
the
sacred
spice
but
not
to
journey
instead
as
sacred
medicine

huge
shifts
bring
huge
change
which
brings
new
reactions
to
old
things
old
stresses
i
used
to
deal
with
in
an
unhealthy
manner
now
demand
my
attention
in
ways
that
i
had
not
expected
and
the
next
day
the
same
was
also
true
of
my
partner

uh-oh

we
had
a
discord
moment
and
an
emotional
fight
ensued
in
order
to
not
feed
the
chaos
i
felt
the
call
of
the
spice
i
moved
upstairs
with
alacrity
and
partook
of
one
small
inhalation
eyes
wide
open
the
spice
had
called
me
and
told
me
it
would
let
me
see
the
problem
in
a
calm
manner
and
find
a
solution
and
it
did
just
that
the
world
calmed
around
me
i
went
downstairs
and
defused
the
situation
and
allowed
us
the
days
of
integration
we
needed
without
the
chaos
of
discord

2
days
of
integration
passed
and
things
in
life
started
to
take
on
a
new
light
my
spouse
and
i
began
to
plan
our
life
changes
that
would
enable
us
to
live
the
way
we
need
spiritually
while
still
maintaining
the
even
the
buddha
does
the
dishes
attitude
and
began
to
plan
a
spiritual
retreat
into
the
wilderness
for
late
this
summer

crystal
intent
my
next
journey
was
rough
meant
to
be
i
felt
called
to
partake
without
any
ritual
whatsoever
25mg
broke
me
through

sixth
journey
begins
back
to
school
chaos
in
the
classroom

what
was
done
cannot
be
undone

i
must
have
crystal
intent

that
was
the
entirety
of
that
breakthrough

1
full
day
of
integration
later
i
crystallized
my
intent
to
allow
the
spice
to
show
me
what
came
next
and
perhaps
to
meet
some
of
my
teachers
should
they
be
ready
to
reveal
themselves


my
seventh
journey
began
with
a
lesson
shared
with
my
spouse
about
singing
bowls
she
liked
to
ding
the
bowl
then
sing
it
this
produces
a
very
subtly
yet
notably
different
tone
than
gently
singing
it
to
volume
i
showed
this
to
her
my
intent
was
crystal
and
i
had
chosen
to
use
one
of
our
large
crystal
clear
pieces
of
spice

23mg
was
all
it
took
1
small
hit
to
begin
and
i
could
feel
it
coming
on
strong
a
second
and
that
was
all
it
took
i
did
not
once
lay
back
the
entire
trip
occurred
in
lotus
position
before
my
singing
bowl

this
one
waswow
again
it
was
also
proof
that
i
open
eyed
breakthrough
as
much
as
i
close
eyed
breakthrough
nothing
i
did
with
my
physical
body
brought
me
out
of
the
lesson

okay
so
bear
with
me
on
this
one
as
it
is
still
very
fresh
and
will
seem
a
bit
less
cohered
in
how
i
can
relate
it
i
have
been
allowed
now
into
hyperspace
the
last
step
was
truly
the
last
step
in
the
school
i
could
see
it
behind
me
a
shining
building
of
light
owl
was
atop
it
watching
me
a
smile
in
his
galactic
eyes

i
turned
to
face
the
path
ahead
streams
of
jewel
colored
impossible
geometry
and
energy
flowed
out
before
me
in
multiple
colors
and
i
began
to
float
or
fly
up
the
stream
strange
beings
are
everywhere
some
watch
on
serenely
vaguely
humanoid
in
body
they
have
heads
of
pure
light
and
they
are
pleased
to
see
i
made
it
small
elves
dance
and
appear
popping
into
and
out
of
existence
using
the
fractals
in
the
air
around
me
as
mirror
doors
to
do
so

læohah
suddenly
stands
before
me
it
is
time
to
face
it
he
sternly
tells
me
i
know
what
he
means
instinctively
and
i
know
what
to
do

all
the
beings
watching
on
are
excited
to
see
how
things
will
turn
out
energy
wells
up
within
me
my
body
purges
didnt
notice
energy
again
wells
up
within
me
head
tilts
back
arches
and
i
started
vocalizing
again
didnt
know
what
my
body
was
doing
a
shadow
comes
out
of
my
eyes
mouth
and
body
interestingly
later
my
partner
before
i
described
what
happened
asked
what
the
shadow
was
that
left
me

it
was
a
monumentally
bad
decision
that
had
brought
this
thing
to
me
and
i
now
had
to
face
it

some
quick
background
when
i
was
younger
and
dumber
i
played
around
with
theban
script
crowley-esque
darker
arts
blood
magic
and
the
necronomicon
and
though
the
book
that
circulates
and
has
since
the
90s
is
not
any
real
sort
of
power
intent
is
numerous
times
while
playing
with
such
things
i
actively
sought
out
darkness

i
knew
i
was
going
to
face
this
shadow
what
i
did
not
know
was
how
pathetically
insignificant
it
was
to
me
now
my
guides
5
of
them
rose
up
to
stand
with
me
læohah
and
four
whos
names
i
know
not
yet
here
we
are
a
being
of
light
and
its
5
ally
spirits
and
i
am
facing
off
a
wisp
of
an
impish
spirit
with
red
eyes
in
its
smoky
form

its
eyes
dart
past
me
to
my
spouse
who
is
on
tape
saying
she
felt
an
evil
presence
leave
me
look
at
her
and
she
noted
how
i
responded

my
head
snapped
to
it
and
i
drove
it
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
space
knowing
it
was
looking
into
the
mortal
realm
to
where
my
partner
sat
i
began
to
unravel
its
darkness
with
speech
in
a
language
i
do
not
know
it
flowed
out
of
me
and
my
hands
began
to
contract
in
various
symbols
rapidly
and
i
tore
it
apart
with
light
in
the
end
a
confused
spirit
was
before
me
who
had
likewise
lost
its
way
with
the
shadow
torn
from
it
it
was
free
once
more
and
it
thanked
me
before
moving
on

cheers
erupted
from
around
me
not
over
my
victory
for
they
knew
i
could
accomplish
that
but
over
how
i
saved
rather
than
destroyed
healed
rather
than
killed
they
assured
me
i
could
very
well
have
ended
it
if
i
had
so
chosen
to
see
that
as
my
path
but
that
i
would
have
lost
my
way
again
had
i
gone
that
route

suddenly
i
am
surrounded
with
entities
great
and
small
geometric
fae
cyber
fractal
humanoid
insect
ancient
so
many
beings
i
began
to
laugh
ecstatically
they
express
an
eagerness
to
one
day
meet
me
in
person
and
get
to
know
me
once
i
complete
my
journey
of
rebirth

i
turn
back
to
the
stream
to
find
all
but
one
of
my
guides
gone
his
name
i
know
not
but
i
know
him
as
the
secret
keeper
he
has
six
arms
and
floats
in
lotus
position
his
bottom
two
arms
constantly
forming
sigils
his
skin
feels
orange
and
is
lined
with
script
in
a
language
i
did
not
recognize
immediately
his
face
is
made
of
impossible
angles
and
6
eyes
surrounding
his
third
eye
it
was
he
who
taught
me
to
speak
in
the
language
of
spirit
and
he
assures
me
one
day
i
will
be
able
to
do
it
without
his
help
it
is
he
who
taught
me
the
hand
sigils

he
asked
me
to
walk
with
him
as
we
moved
up
the
stream
of
energy
we
had
chosen
to
walk
he
said
he
wanted
to
impart
something
on
me
but
in
order
to
do
so
he
would
have
to
enter
my
sacred
temple
and
would
only
do
so
invited
our
souls
touched
i
was
not
repulsed
and
so
i
accepted
his
gift
he
entered
me
and
i
began
to
chant
aloud
in
a
different
language
swiftly
my
hands
moving
like
lightning
through
sigils
knowledge
of
things
i
am
still
grasping
poured
into
me
as
he
entered
me
i
felt
so
much
energy
inside
me
that
i
felt
like
i
was
about
to
explode
i
felt
as
though
lightning
should
be
coming
off
of
me
he
stepped
out
of
me

coming
back
to
earth
consciousness
was
beautiful
and
i
could
feel
the
energy
of
life
around
me
for
hours
afterwards
i
know
now
for
what
i
was
chosen
a
path
that
has
called
me
time
and
again
yet
been
unheeded
my
path
is
the
path
of
the
shaman
i
am
new
upon
it
i
know
nothing
i
have
nothing
to
give
save
humility
and
a
willingness
to
learn
time
and
further
meditation
experience
in
nature
journeying
will
continue
i
have
no
ego
in
this
whether
i
will
ever
be
a
shaman
is
as
of
yet
unknown
i
can
only
walk
the
path
and
see
where
it
leads




today
is
the
last
day
of
my
holiday
well
actually
my
holiday
finished
on
monday
but
the
brothers
are
on
strike
so
it
is
as
such
a
day
off
i
had
not
been
able
to
find
anything
to
smoke
for
most
of
my
week
off
which
had
been
my
original
intention
i
was
going
to
use
the
week
off
to
try
out
some
trips
that
i
had
in
mind
i
was
going
to
have
one
where
i
would
use
a
hefty
dose
of
either
4-ho-dmt
or
4-aco-dmt
as
a
platform
from
which
to
launch
forays
into
dmt
space
with
my
vapouriser
i
had
had
some
spectacular
results
in
this
fashion
and
wanted
to
push
it
further
with
a
higher
dose
of
the
4sub
and
some
bigger
hits
i
also
had
bought
some
yellow
caapi
extract
101
which
i
hoped
to
use
to
potentiate
a
dose
of
dmt
orally


plans
never
work
out
how
you
expect
them
to
and
the
weed
was
not
forthcoming
until
thurday
night
by
which
time
it
was
too
late
my
mrs
finishes
work
early
on
a
friday
so
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
accommodate
a
big
adventure
in
the
time
before
she
returned
during
the
week
i
had
vapourised
a
couple
of
times
and
found
my
headspace
clearer
than
usual
which
i
had
put
down
to
the
lack
of
thc
floating
around
my
system
i
had
prayed
during
and
imediatley
after
my
hits
that
i
might
have
strength
to
deal
with
my
excessive
weed
smoking
heres
a
secret
that
may
be
the
ramblings
of
a
hyperchondriac
or
a
grudging
acknowledgement
of
a
tragic
folly
my
lungs
are
really
bad
i
get
attacks
at
night
where
my
chest
is
tight
and
i
can
only
just
get
enough
air
to
breathe
with
considerable
effort
with
calmness
and
resignation
i
wait
for
it
to
pass
after
i
am
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
did
not
use
to
be
like
that
and
that
perhaps
they
are
damaged
now
i
am
fit
in
general
i
am
slim
muscular
and
get
regular
exercise
as
part
of
my
postmans
day
at
work
i
am
generally
a
happy
man
with
a
loving
mrs
and
family
sometimes
everything
seems
great
with
the
only
stain
being
my
selfish
and
self
destructive
weed
habit
this
week
i
was
going
to
have
one
last
heavy
smoking
session
alongside
some
deep
trips
to
work
on
my
perceptions
and
relationship
with
weed
it
was
the
occasion
of
my
birthday
during
the
week
and
i
was
intending
to
have
some
deep
thoughts
about
plans
for
the
future
with
my
loved
one


on
the
last
day
of
my
holiday
at
9am
i
simmered
3grams
of
the
caapi
extract
over
the
gas
hob
in
a
ceramic
pan
after
an
hour
i
sat
with
the
strained
liquid
and
sipped
it
gently
while
typing
up
this
preamble
i
am
was
not
sure
how
much
synth
dmt
to
go
for
then
the
dynamics
of
the
game
were
varied
amongst
the
reports
i
had
read
so
that
if
only
a
weak
maoi
inhibition
is
achieved
this
cannot
be
countered
simply
by
blitzing
with
the
dmt
i
also
could
not
afford
to
overdo
the
caapi
on
account
of
the
fact
that
a
i
had
only
previously
experienced
use
of
syrian
rue
for
maoi
purposes
and
b
that
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
nice
salad
with
p
this
evening
when
she
got
back
from
work
i
was
it
seemed
fumbling
a
bit


i
swallowed
70mgs
of
dmt
[freebase]
in
a
cigarette
paper
and
went
for
a
joint
to
relax
me
a
bit
the
effects
of
the
caapi
alone
were
not
noticeable
except
for
a
slight
but
undefinable
jitteriness
which
might
have
been
placebo
i
could
feel
my
empty
stomach
admitting
the
previously
swallowed
parcel
but
twenty
minutes
later
and
i
couldnt
feel
any
major
change
going
on
perhaps
a
slight
buzz
but
i
had
just
partaken
of
some
weed
so
it
was
accounted
for
i
had
steve
roach
playing
which
was
particularly
soothing
although
i
had
not
properly
listened
to
the
album
so
that
might
have
explained
its
seemingly
profound
nature
i
had
read
that
the
caapi
extracts
are
often
not
quite
as
potent
as
the
101
ration
suggests
and
there
was
the
question
of
intention
too
i
approached
this
trip
with
caution
owing
to
time
constraints
and
of
course
fear
if
i
hadnt
been
expecting
my
mrs
back
home
at
430pm
and
didnt
have
to
be
up
next
morning
on
the
dot
i
would
have
brewed
perhaps
more
caapi
and
swallowed
all
the
dregs
as
well
followed
by
100mg
dmt
maybe
more
but
because
of
these
constraints
my
caution
probably
put
me
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
sweet
spot
perhaps
i
was
not
even
intending
to
go
into
this
properly
and
so
it
was
doomed
to
fail
i
am
still
open
minded
i
know
these
things
can
sneak
up
and
thoroughly
wallop
you
when
you
least
expect
it


my
first
ayahuasca
analogue
caught
me
in
just
such
a
way
i
had
used
rue
and
jurema
bark
to
brew
about
5
years
back
it
was
before
i
had
heard
of
research
chemicals
pihkal
or
machine
elves
i
really
only
knew
of
it
as
a
sacred
amazonian
brew
and
it
seemed
the
next
stage
up
from
mushrooms
which
were
then
freely
sold
in
uk
headshops
that
first
time
all
those
years
ago
i
had
drunk
the
brew
as
instructed
and
held
it
in
place
for
a
good
hour
or
more
unfortunately
i
could
not
resist
as
a
flood
of
nausea
forced
me
to
give
up
the
goods
quite
violently
i
was
disappointed
on
account
of
the
efforts
i
had
gone
to
in
order
to
obtain
brew
and
prepare
for
the
experience
i
equate
the
vomiting
with
the
loss
of
the
active
ingredients
and
therefor
the
end
of
the
experience
i
rolled
a
longish
joint
and
sat
on
the
backdoor
step
of
my
victorian
terrace
watching
rain
run
down
the
guttering
in
the
yard
as
i
smoked
i
became
weary
and
finishing
the
joint
i
tumbled
upstairs
to
bed
with
miles
live
evil
album
running
through
my
mind
i
fell
asleep
easily
enough
but
at
some
later
point
all
hell
broke
loose
my
being
found
itself
propelled
somewhere
completely
different
and
unexpected
it
was
visually
stunning
and
alive
with
movement
of
mechanical
and
fluid
origin
there
was
architectural
opulence
in
many
blended
cultural
styles
with
overhead
walkways
and
bridges
corridors
and
passages
all
filled
with
strange
beings
wearing
carnivalesque
masks
the
expression
borne
by
the
masks
was
a
kind
of
grimace
which
reflected
my
own
sense
of
a
kind
of
pressure
i
was
feeling
physically
which
would
surge
up
from
time
to
time
these
surges
were
accompanied
by
a
busying
of
the
visual
field
i
could
feel
a
sense
of
panic
rise
in
me
as
this
took
place
i
couldnt
for
the
life
of
me
remember
what
had
led
me
to
be
in
this
situation
which
was
frightening
it
begged
other
questions
like
had
things
always
been
like
this
would
they
remain
this
way
always
why
was
there
for
all
the
strangeness
a
sense
of
familiarity
to
all
this


these
questions
became
less
once
i
had
remembered
to
open
my
eyes
oh
yes
i
thought
thats
it
i
recalled
the
prequel
to
this
story
that
moment
one
of
my
own
efforts
this
i
looked
at
the
digital
alarm
clock
in
an
attempt
to
ground
myself
a
bit
more
helpfully
it
read
8888
and
i
was
left
none
the
wiser
i
could
see
the
funny
side
of
things
but
i
was
a
little
alarmed
by
the
strong
physical
sensations
over
which
i
had
little
control
i
was
very
cold
and
shivering
violently
the
physiological
surges
i
spoke
of
were
connected
to
this
cold
and
i
was
experiencing
what
i
would
now
consider
a
body
load
nausea
had
passed
but
i
was
still
uncomfortable
inconveniently
i
needed
to
visit
the
toilet
and
had
to
negotiate
the
stairs
to
the
bathroom
i
was
shivering
so
much
that
the
ascent
to
the
bathroom
was
challenging
on
top
of
that
on
arrival
at
the
bowl
the
violent
shivers
made
it
very
difficult
to
successfully
aim
my
projectile
i
had
to
try
and
grip
my
member
and
maintain
its
position
while
compensating
for
the
strange
oscillations
the
rest
of
my
shivering
frame
performed
after
that
i
had
a
joint
while
lying
on
my
bed
breaking
our
no
smoking
policy
in
the
house
this
time
i
allowed
myself
the
pleasure
seeing
that
i
had
just
witnessed
the
most
bizarre
experience
of
my
life
building
a
joint
proved
difficult
owing
to
my
visual
status
great
clots
of
hallucinated
matter
were
forming
and
falling
off
all
the
planes
of
the
bedroom
seemingly
of
organic
or
plant
like
origin
while
the
wall
were
festooned
with
rapidly
animated
hieroglyphs
and
typesets
of
bizarre
characters
along
with
tapestry-like
scenes
and
patterns
i
was
strongly
aware
of
rich
red
and
purple
tones
as
well
as
yellows

as
i
looked
at
my
fingers
rolling
the
joint
i
saw
letters
and
what
appeared
to
be
transfers
peeling
from
my
hands
and
from
my
joint
i
also
had
difficulty
differentiating
between
the
tobacco
and
marijuana
both
seeming
to
be
alive
like
some
teeming
mass
subsequently
the
joint
may
have
been
more
heavily
loaded
than
my
usual
habit
the
actual
roll
and
glue
operation
was
perfect
perhaps
a
reflection
of
how
ingrained
the
neural
pathways
of
this
act
had
become
back
in
bed
i
sparked
up
drawing
deep
in
the
belief
that
whatever
is
happening
a
joint
always
mellows
me
under
these
circumstances
this
was
not
necessarily
the
case

was
not
necessarily
the
case

the
smoke
was
soothing
and
familiar
to
me
but
at
the
same
time
seemed
to
wind
the
experience
up
as
well
the
eyes
closed
visuals
had
subsided
into
swirling
and
twisting
geometrical
patterns
by
this
point
but
the
smoke
pushed
a
plume
of
dynamic
fluctuation
into
them
which
swarmed
and
engulfed
my
being
there
were
meshing
gears
made
of
stone
and
twisting
vines
all
in
this
maelstrom
and
by
smoking
i
was
finding
it
hard
to
feel
separated
from
this
i
felt
my
consciousness
being
bent
and
squeezed
into
geometrically
impossible
knots
and
mathematically
unviable
shapes
i
felt
no
control
over
where
these
experiences
would
lead
all
i
could
do
was
choose
to
puff
on
my
joint
if
i
felt
like
it
the
process
began
to
ease
off
around
about
which
time
i
stopped
feeling
quite
so
cold
i
started
to
feel
a
little
hungry
believe
it
or
not
but
i
thought
i
should
wait
i
really
fancied
a
cup
of
tea
as
well
i
was
steadier
on
my
feet
thankfully
and
took
a
shower
my
visual
field
was
still
a
bit
sparkly
still
but
just
in
a
hyper-real
sense
rather
than
hallucinatory
i
had
another
smoke
and
found
that
a
film
of
elvis
in
las
vegas
68
was
on
tv
which
suited
me
perfectly
right
there
and
then


well
it
took
me
a
good
hour
to
type
my
notes
and
impressions
and
i
felt
sober
happy
and
a
bit
hungry
what
a
terrible
waste
of
70mgs
of
spice
[dmt]
however
i
really
vapourise
too
often
because
it
plays
havoc
with
my
lungs
aside
their
usual
punishment
from
weed
after
typing
i
went
for
a
cuppa
and
a
danish
pastry
from
the
bakers
round
the
corner
i
hoped
mother
ayahuasca
would
not
decide
to
clobber
me
in
the
pieshop
peace
and
love

so
much
to
say
so
much
to
say
and
yet
no
words
for
any
of
it
i
mean
what
kind
of
affect
could
a
five
minute
long
experience
really
have
on
your
life
detrimental

ill
try
to
start
at
the
beginning
but
im
not
entirely
sure
i
know
where
this
whole
thing
began
i
would
imagine
it
starts
off
like
most
of
these
accounts
my
me
staring
nervously
at
a
small
amount
of
off
white
powder
inside
a
small
glass
vial
standing
next
to
a
small
crudely
made
tinfoil
pipe
sitting
on
a
small
wooden
nightstand

i
had
longed
to
experience
dmt
hyperspace
since
my
early
teens
but
after
one
botched
mimosa
hostilis
extraction
that
yielded
nothing
i
doubted
the
time
would
ever
come
a
few
years
after
the
initial
extraction
attempt
i
decided
that
i
had
grown
a
little
older
and
a
little
wiser
and
that
perhaps
another
extraction
would
be
in
order
a
week
or
so
after
acquiring
my
mimosa
and
the
other
various
supplies
i
needed
the
word
success
shattered
the
silence
in
my
otherwise
quiet
residence
i
was
jubilated
to
say
the
least
and
could
hardly
wait
until
my
300+mgs
of
dmt
was
fully
dry
before
tasting
the
precious
chemical


a
few
days
later
the
time
had
come

with
no
appropriate
smoking
device
available
and
certainly
not
going
to
wait
for
one
to
pop
up
i
quickly
fashioned
one
from
al
foil
with
a
bit
of
ash
from
my
newport
for
a
screen
all
seemed
well
a
quick
test
of
a
small
amount
of
the
material
approx
5
mg
produced
very
pronounced
effects
blown
away
by
such
a
significant
and
successful
trial
run
i
assumed
that
perhaps
i
was
hyper
sensitive
to
this
particular
compound
one
more
low
dose
try
for
this
night
i
told
himself
as
i
added
perhaps
another
15mgs
to
the
pipe
brought
pipe
to
mouth
flicked
my
lighter
and
inhaled
deeply

oh
sweet
goddess
what
have
i
done
to
myself
this
was
a
huge
mistaaamumbling
noises
i
didnt
quite
finish
the
word
mistake
before
the
dmt
bitch-slapped
the
ego
right
the
fuck
out
of
me
after
a
moment
or
perhaps
it
was
an
eternity
for
the
distinction
between
the
two
was
impossible
i
had
no
idea
what
i
had
done
to
himself
thank
the
goddess
for
that
another
author
nailed
it
and
in
un-being
i
had
lost
my
fear
wish
i
could
remember
who
said
it
so
i
could
give
them
credit
or
how
i
found
himself
in
my
current
predicament
wtf
i
know
i
left
my
body
around
here
somewhere


nothing
no
wait
colors
lots
of
em
enormous
fractal
patterns
how
did
i
get
like
this
was
i
always
like
this
is
this
normal
existence
no
no
no
this
isnt
right
at
all
what
happened
i
must
be
dead
nothing
else
could
explain
this

wait
a
minute
i
smoked
a
very
strong
psychedelic
substance
yes
thats
it
ooooh
look
at
that
i
recognize
my
room
again
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
the
effects
fade
after
two
or
three
minutes
and
reality
is
starting
to
seep
back
in
around
the
edges
jesus
h
christ

there
is
no
handling
this
stuff
i
wasnt
quite
sure
where
the
fear
came
from
but
im
sure
the
crazy
fast
onset
didnt
help
no
sir
not
one
bit

after
five
minutes
or
so
i
literally
had
tears
streaming
down
my
face
from
both
relief
and
the
awesome
power
of
this
chemical
an
odd
side
note
i
started
getting
very
bad
tremors
a
few
minutes
after
the
peak
was
over
and
that
these
tremors
escalated
to
the
point
of
near
convulsions
yet
they
passed
within
a
few
minutes
im
not
all
sure
what
that
was
about
but
i
seemed
fine
after
they
passed

god-damn
if
15mgs
could
do
that
imagine
what
the
full
50mgs
would
be
likei
can
honestly
say
i`m
not
sure
if
ill
ever
be
in
the
mood
to
do
this
again
maybe
i
should
just
put
it
in
the
stash
box
and
wait
to
see
if
it
ever
calls
me
again

sure
enough
a
few
short
weeks
later
i
wake
up
at
the
un-godly
hour
of
500am
for
unknown
reasons
ring
ring
ring
ring
hello
whos
thereoh
its
you
mister
nn
whats
that
you
say
you
want
to
hang
out
again
i
dunnoyou
really
got
to
promise
to
play
nicer
this
time
yeah
well
well
see
to
this
day
i
swear
i
had
no
idea
what
prompted
me
to
pull
out
that
pipe
and
vial
or
why
i
woke
up
at
such
a
strange
hour
and
i
am
quite
the
sleeper

after
some
debating
i
load
up
an
unknown
but
large
amount
of
dmt
into
the
pipe
i
sit
breathing
deeply
trying
to
calm
my
racing
heart
i
stare
melanchololy
is
this
a
word
at
the
pipe
my
palms
are
drenched
with
sweat
my
breathing
comes
in
strained
ragged
pulls
i
hears
the
call
loudly
now
the
promise
of
the
profound
whispers
to
me
i
bring
the
pipe
to
my
lips
holds
a
flame
a
bit
away
from
the
material
and
draw
in
deep
i
decide
one
huge
hit
will
do
it
i
hold
the
harsh
synthetic
tasting
smoke
in
my
lungs
for
what
feels
like
an
eternity
before
exhaling
i
wait

nothing
nothing
yes
nothing
five
seconds
after
i
exhaled
still
nothing
why
isnt
it
working
the
anticipation
is
unbearable
cause
without
consequence
perhaps
slightly
off
kilter
i
think
one
more
hit
i
guess
i
reach
for
the
pipe
but
wait
somethings
happening
i
think
its
hitting
meeeeeeeeee
at
that
moment
the
sound
of
my
inner
monologue
became
hideously
twisted
into
a
high
pitched
squealing
sound
getting
louder
and
louder
always
rising
in
pitch


carrier
waves
are
really
something
to
behold
i
thought
to
himself
afterwards
not
many
other
psychedelics
that
i
had
tasted
had
any
auditory
aspectbut
this
one
sure
did

pings
pops
sproings
and
groans
fill
my
head
i
attempt
to
wonder
why
i
did
this
to
himself
again
but
that
concept
is
soon
lost
in
a
swirling
roiling
haze
of
twisted
awareness
and
perception
of
the
nothing
filled
with
fractals
that
surrounds

me
on
some
level
i
am
dimly
aware
of
the
place
i
reached
on
my
last
visit
as
it
soon
flies
by
me
in
a
seething
sickening
wave
of
geometry
i
resist
swimming
up
niagara
falls
with
arms
and
legs
tied
would
be
easier
i
know
i
need
to
relax
and
not
fight
it
but
i
cant
and
am
swept
in
a
torrent
of
violent
light
and
color


a
female
voice
screams
at
me
relax
i
cant
i
reply
yes
you
can
youve
done
this
before
remember
everything
will
be
okay
i
promise
the
voice
beckons
the
voice
is
so
beautiful
so
inhuman
i
cant
help
but
trust
it
i
listen
i
obey
let
go
and
hold
on
resistance
is
futile
anyway
i
am
sucked
deeper
and
deeper
into
this
whimsical
mystical
magical
abyss
im
not
sure
if
the
voice
was
actually
an
auditory
hallucination
or
more
my
own
instincts

the
colors
duke
the
colors
visuals
isnt
the
word
designs
and
geometry
everywhere
impossible
designs
such
patterns
are
far
to
complex
to
exist
complexity
that
is
so
great
that
if
one
were
to
ever
gaze
upon
such
a
thing
while
not
under
the
influence
they
would
surely
go
completely
insane
damn
things
wont
sit
still
long
enough
for
me
to
figure
out
what
they
represent
i
mean
come
on
such
things
would
never
exist
without
purpose
i
mean
nobody
would
ever
go
through
the
trouble
of
making
them
if
they
didnt
have
some
function

they
arethe
word
is
machine
like
the
whole
thing
bodes
of
high
alien
technology
how
else
could
it
be
explained
but
wait
they
arent
just
machines
they
areorganic
no
they
are
sentient
in
some
far
fucked
up
way
they
are
alive
how
can
such
a
hugely
complex
impossible
gigantic
thing
be
self
aware
i
dont
know
yet
they
most
certainly
are
maybe
im
just
imagining
things
i
dont
stick
around
long
i
continue
my
downward/sideways/diagonal
spiral
into
madness

more
fractal
machine
entities
they
are
getting
bigger
more
complex
they
join
with
one
another
they
break
apart
they
dance
they
sing
they
sing
their
songs
are
so
far
beyond
beautiful
sung
with
such
amazing
grace
and
practiced
ease
the
beauty
of
it
is
unbearable
the
sound
creates
more
of
the
crystalline
fractal
creatures
which
in
turn
start
singing
in
unison
with
the
others
i
cant
stand
this
much
beauty
i
cant
fucking
take
it
the
sound
flows
right
through
me
as
certain
notes
and
pitches
resonate
through
the
entire
fiber
of
my
being
heaven


youve
done
this
before
remember
echoes
in
my
head
yes
i
have
done
this
before
i`ve
been
here
before
i
have
come
home
an
overwhelming
sensation
of
deja-vu
overcomes
me
in
this
moment
everything
that
happened
before
this
doesnt
matter
i
dont
care
how
i
got
here
just
that
i
am
nothing
matters
anymore
joy
completely
overcomes
me
and
i
allow
it
to
no
longer
fighting
just
thanking
whoever
or
whatever
put
me
here
in
this
moment
with
these
creatures
love
is
the
message
the
tune
carries
they
are
what
inspires
all
love
to
be
these
crystal/gel
creations
are
loves
cause/muse
this
is
the
goddess
or
god
or
buddha
or
allah
whatever
you
call
it
the
song
remains
the
same
the
message
unflinchinglove
unity
peace
harmony
corny
but
no
other
explanation
will
sufficehell
this
one
doesnt
even
begin
to
do
it
justice
i
stay
here
with
these
entities
for
several
thousand
eternities
dancing
singing
being
bliss

the
song
starts
to
fadeim
falling
awake
shit
the
compound
wears
off
im
suddenly
and
violently
pulled
backwards
through
their
world
a
world
where
humans
cant
exist
for
too
long
im
already
seen
far
too
much
been
there
far
too
long
the
room
swims
in
my
vision
which
is
still
totally
fucked
and
useless
objects
start
to
become
recognizable
again
bed
tv
chair
computer
lamp
etc
slowly
but
surely
one
by
one
they
all
come
into
focus


amazement
beyond
words
i
am
totally
completely
stunned
and
speechless
words
flow
forth
from
my
mouth
but
they
dont
even
begin
to
scratch
the
surface
of
what
i
just
experienced
yet
i
feels
compelled
to
try
feels
compelled
to
explain
out
loud
what
just
happened
even
though
i
am
alone
how
the
hell
am
i
supposed
to
go
on
living
after
that
am
i
really
just
expected
to
carry
on
with
my
life
as
usual
after
this
impossible
i
say
out
loud
the
tremors
come
and
go
worse
this
time
but
i
am
okay
i
stare
at
the
wall
tears
streaming
down
my
face
screaming
the
words
thank
you
over
and
over
again
to
who
im
sure
but
it
seems
the
least
i
can
do
after
receiving
such
an
amazing
gift
of
eternity

i
fell
asleep
shortly
afterwards
had
incredibly
vivid
dreams
and
woke
up
feeling
great
new
lease
on
life
one
might
say
i
feel
an
awe
and
reverence
to
this
daythe
song
is
still
heard
to
some
extent
and
i
doubt
it
will
ever
leave
me
entirely
i
will
never
forget

i
hope
i
did
my
experience
some
kind
of
justice
but
for
anyone
who
hasnt
experienced
this
amazing
compound
i
doubt
this
will
do
any
good
i
pride
myself
on
being
somewhat
well-read
dont
be
fooled
by
the
puncuation
and
spelling

but
words
just
seem
hopelessly
inadequate
im
not
sure
what
more
needs
to
be
said
or
could
be
said
for
that
matter
so
well
leave
it
at
that
wish
i
had
some
cool
final
sumation
some
final
bit
of
wisdom
that
ties
this
all
together
nicely
but
alas
i
dont
words
just
arent
enough




at
some
point
in
our
past
jetsam
and
i
were
blessed
by
a
dear
friend
with
a
large
vial
nearly
full
4-5g
of
lab
grade
dmt
thus
ensued
much
experimentation
amongst
the
2
of
us
and
several
of
our
closest
friends
i
wont
go
into
descriptions
of
what
occurred
during
or
what
we
emotionally
brought
out
of
those
experiences
what
i
want
to
discuss
here
is
what
we
learned
to
make
the
experience
the
most
meaningful
and
enjoyable









smiling




low
level
lighting




music
preferably
with
few
or
no
lyrics




quiet
environment
otherwise
especially
no
talking




comfortable
seating




smiling




pipe
holder
and
guide




a
focal
point




smile




chanting




breathing
deeply








ok
so
you
have
the
chance
to
do
dmt
you
should
feel
good
its
not
too
often
one
gets
such
opportunities
think
about
that
for
a
second
now
before
you
do
anything
else
smile
just
look
around
you
and
smile

smiling
has
more
effect
on
a
dmt
experience
than
any
other
variable





low
lighting
is
very
important
darkness
isnt
too
bad
but
bright
light
is
terrible
avoid
sunshine
just
enough
light
to
make
out
the
color
of
objects
around
you
is
best




as
with
any
strong
psychedelic
experience
music
can
play
a
crucial
role
the
flavor
of
your
musical
selection
can
greatly
influence
the
experience
think
about
different
choices
beforehand
the
one
thing
to
avoid
is
anything
with
a
lot
of
lyrics
words
in
general
seem
to
greatly
diminish
the
experience
more
on
this
in
the
next
paragraph
volume
can
be
whatever
youre
comfortable
with
although
overly
loud
has
shown
to
be
unpleasant
one
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
the
peak
experience
only
lasts
5-8
minutes
with
another
5-10
of
re-entry
so
choose
songs
accordingly




other
than
whatever
music
you
might
choose
or
not
all
quiet
is
good
too
the
environment
around
you
should
be
relatively
quiet

no
talking


where
smiling
brings
about
good
things
people
talking
nearby
has
the
opposite
effect
of
either
bringing
one
down
or
darkening
the
experience
a
distant
hum
of
people
is
fine
but
the
act
of
processing
language
while
in
the
midst
of
a
dmt
experience
invariably
is
a
bad
thing
without
music
the
sounds
of
a
house
are
incredible
also
bug
sounds
at
night
outside
can
be
quite
stimulating
maybe
too
stimulating
for
some




by
this
point
youve
probably
already
decided
where
it
is
youre
going
to
be
for
the
experience
fluff
it
up
you
want
a
comfortable
place
where
you
can
either
sit
or
lie
back
without
fear
of
hitting
yourself
against
anything
[one
particularly
intriguing
way
is
to
lay
your
head
in
a
trusted
someones
lap
while
they
concentrate
on
you
and
perhaps
gently
hold
your
head]




ok
youve
picked
your
place
and
your
sounds
and
made
your
proverbial
bed
before
you
lie
in
it
its
time
to
smile
again
check
it
out
youre
about
to
do
dmt
and
youre
about
to
do
it
in
style
thats
definitely
worth
a
big

smile

take
a
moment
to
calm
yourself
think
of
something
wonderful
and

smile





until
youve
done
dmt
several
times
a
pipe
holder
someone
who
holds
and
lights
the
pipe
for
you
is
strongly
recommended
in
the
best
case
this
person
doubles
as
a
guide
having
a
number
of
dmt
experiences
under
hir
belt
already
and
able
to
cast
their
own
[positive]
variables
into
the
stew
as
a
guide
i
whisper
a
single
word
with
positive
conotations
in
their
ear
just
as
they
exhale
the
last
hit
my
default
word
is
of
course
smile

otherwise
this
person
doubles
as
a
sitter
there
to
hold
the
pipe
and
maybe
your
hand
during
the
experience
in
any
case
it
feels
much
better
to
have
someone
there




we
found
that
a
focal
point
while
taking
the
hits
can
produce
the
most
unbelievable
take
offs
find
something
with
contrast
to
focus
solely
on
until
you
reach
the
peak
a
candle
flame
or
a
plant
in
front
of
a
plain
wall
both
work
well
it
goes
way
beyond
any
concept
of
kaleidescope




here
we
go
its
not
like
you
can
read
a
step-by-step
from
here
on
because
at
this
point
youre
inhaling
burning
plastic
get
over
the
taste
with
time
you
may
even
come
to
like
it
similar
to
oysters
or
escargot





so
whats
left
to
tell
the
very
last
thing
you
should
do
when
you
are

exhaling
the
last
hit
is

smile

something
about
moving
those
particular
muscles
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
even
if
its
the
foulest
thing
youve
ever
tasted
force
yourself
to
smile
during
the
experience
youll
be
glad
you
did




once
immersed
in
the
peak
some
people
find
chanting
some
meaningless
sound
or
mantra
helps
remember
to
breathe
normally
ive
had
the
common
sensation
of
feeling
as
though
i
havent
taken
a
breath
in
some
time
when
actually
i
just
wasnt
aware
of
it
a
nice
deep
breath
in
those
cases
feels
great
and
serves
to
remind
me
my
bodys
ok




try
these
guidelines
for
yourself
submit
a
writeup
of
your
results
to
erowid
i
wish
you
many
smiles






spirituality/knowledge
have
long
been
my
core
principles
until
recently
i
wasnt
really
up
for
considering
the
use
of
drugs
to
help
me
attain
them
i
was
once
told
that
dmt
would
help
connect
me
to
the
spirit
world
needless
to
say
this
changed
everything
taking
dmt
was
a
must
not
an
option
this
report
will
chronicle
my
experiences
with
dmt
smoked
and
consumed
ayahuasca
simply
put
its
proven
to
me
to
be
so
enveloping
and
powerful
that
i
would
not
advise
or
condone
anyone
who
is
unsure/unwilling
to
do
it
or
even
read
my
latter
experiences
with
the
drug
sometimes
a
human
is
best
not
knowing
the
incomprehensible
before
i
go
further
i
must
stress
the
difficulty
of
decoding
my
personal
experience
into
language


those
who
have
taken
dmt
will
relate

dmt
is
truly
indescribable
but
i
will
do
my
best

a
couple
friends
and
i
extracted
our
dmt
from
the
root
bark
of
the
acacia
confusa
plant

a
couple
friends
and
i
extracted
our
dmt
from
the
root
bark
of
the
acacia
confusa
plant

what
we
received
is
a
lifetime
of
experience
in
the
form
of
white
powder
my
first
time
smoking
was
from
a
suspicious-looking
pipe
in
a
living
room
with
2
friends
one
of
them
actually
asked
the
head
shop
attendant
for
a
\x93crack
pipe
-_-
no
questions
asked
we
were
on
our
way

what
came
next

among
my
countless
revelations
after
first
taking
dmt
the
first
was
pure
shock
and
respect
for
its
abnormal
power
i
did
as
my
research
told
me
to
do
and
took
one
giant
hit
holding
in
as
long
as
possible
knowing
that
i
was
supposed
to
take
more
i
reached
back
for
more
as
soon
as
i
exhaled
the
first
hit
and
put
the
pipe
back
up
to
my
mouth
i
had
already
entered
another
dimension
my
hands/arms
began
to
appear
\x93alien-like
and
the
world
around
me
evolved
into
a
delicate
water-like
atmosphere
complete
with
kaleidoscope
patterns

i
became
afraid
very
afraid
what
i
realized
was
that
everything
i
was
seeing
was
not
only
real
but
more
real
than
anything
i
had
ever
seen
it
was
almost
as
if
this
little
powder
was
allowing
me
to
view
the
world
as
it
really
is
i
then
hastily
closed
my
eyes
my
third
\x93eye
wide
open

while
my
eyes
were
closed
the
ancient-egyptian
god
anubis
appeared
in
front
of
me
i
then
realized
my
hidden
power
to
communicate
telepathically
anubis
or
who
i
perceived
to
be
so
welcomed
me
by
performing
a
symphony
of
colors
going
in
a
circular
pattern
it
was
almost
as
if
i
were
a
child
being
taken
to
swimming
lessons
the
being
took
full
control
of
my
feelings
granting
me
temporary
sanctuary
from
my
innocent
brain

realizing
dmts
short-lasting
effects
15
minutes
the
first
time
i
opened
my
eyes
almost
on
command
i
picked
up
the
pipe
and
smoked
three
more
hits
the
visuals
didnt
hit
as
intense
this
time
i
was
struck
with
intense
fear
unlike
id
ever
experienced
pure
terror
i
was
being
laughed
at
each
breath
was
a
struggle
for
life
it
was
at
this
moment
that
my
ego
died
relinquishing
all
fears
of
death
nature
life
i
no
longer
believed
i
had
any
answers
about
life
i
am
not
on
the
outside
looking
in
or
the
inside
looking
out
i
was
in
the
dead
center
of
the
room
of
life
looking
around
for
answers
that
will
never
be
found
as
a
result
i
began
believing
in
inner-dimensional
\x93alien
beings
i
wouldnt
even
be
surprised
if
aliens
landed
on
my
front
lawn
right
now
and
i
was
never
one
to
believe
in
them
prior

this
experience
lasted
a
total
of
45
minutes
i
came
down
a
new
person
ready
to
dive
in
and
discover
more
into
the
secrets
held
by
the
molecule
one
of
my
friends
had
to
go
to
work
right
after
so
we
let
him
do
so
my
other
friend
and
i
went
outside
to
talk
about
what
we
experienced
all
we
could
say
was
\x93oh
my
god
we
then
let
the
day
pass
and
attempted
blasting-off
again
the
next
day
when
i
picked
up
the
pipe
this
time
i
was
instantly
struck
with
the
same
gut-sinking
fear
as
before
but
proceeded
back
into
the
realm
under
the
caring
observance
of
my
friends

it
was
almost
as
if
the
first
blast-off
was
a
trial-run
a
programmed
adventure
giving
both
admiration
and
respect
for
the
substance
yet
very
simple
to
pack
up
and
walk
away
for
good
the
second
would
soon
take
me
one
step
further
i
meditated
quickly
to
calm/prepare
myself
a
practice
which
i
learned
to
do
before
every
experience


then
it
gets
weird

i
decided
to
smoke
until
i
couldnt
inhale
anymore
this
time
i
took
four
big
hits
resulting
in
a
80-100mg
dose
i
knew
that
i
was
really
going
somewhere
this
time

i
was
taken
to
a
beautiful
red-looking
structure
surrounded
by
a
light
red-orange
looking
set
of
bricks
i
couldnt
even
begin
actually
describing
what
i
saw
remembering
my
ability
to
telepathically
communicate
with
the
intelligent
beings
around
me
i
sent
out
a
message
\x93what
am
i
supposed
to
be
doing
to
which
a
by-standing
being
so
eloquently
responded
in
its
best
translation
\x93now
he/she
these
beings
are
often
androgynous
told
me
that
i
was
to
learn
more
about
this
dimension
before
moving
to
the
next
stage
in
life
i
then
discovered
that
these
beings
have
the
power
to
implant
feelings/thoughts
in
your
brain
they
gave
me
a
resounding
feeling
of
comfort
and
welcome
into
their
world
i
was
taken
back
to
my
world
while
receiving
their
message
to
come
back
again
i
had
made
inner-dimensional
friends
excited
as
i
was
they
then
began
playing
an
interest
in
me

my
current
house
was
built
over
100
years
ago
so
suspicions
of
having
ghosts
living
amongst
us
had
long
been
home
to
various
jokes
around
the
house
but
after
smoking
in
the
house
a
few
other
occasions
i
noticed
there
was
a
certain
being
that
really
wanted
to
communicate
with
me


the
first
time
i
met
this
being
she
appeared
to
be
a
middle-eastern
woman
with
the
bright
eyes
often
pictured
in
dmt
artwork
she
dressed
in
a
bright
dishdasha
staring
into
my
soul
she
instantly
conveyed
to
me
her
urgency
to
speak
with
me
without
using
the
english
language
of
course
and
i
refused
her
audience
creating
one
hell
of
a
bad
trip
dmt
beings
carry
a
lot
of
intimidating
aura
with
them
so
as
easy
as
it
is
to
say
\x93you
should
have
just
talked
to
her
it
is
a
frightening
thing
to
do
i
had
read
all
about
people
seeing/talking
to
\x93aliens
on
dmt
which
was
mainly
why
i
was
so
curious
of
the
drug

i
had
read
all
about
people
seeing/talking
to
\x93aliens
on
dmt
which
was
mainly
why
i
was
so
curious
of
the
drug

but
you
dont
fully
accept
that
they
are
real
until
they
appear
right
in
front
of
you
looking
right
at
you
in
your
eyes
eventually
i
was
forced
in
to
talking
to
her

<br/><br/>a
good
visual
idea
of
her
eyes
can
be
seen
in
the
skull
of
the
man
in
this
artwork<br/><br/>http//31mediatumblrcom/3baa0eecf8e06a519056e27705d8c2f3/tumblr_mrmu6xuzrd1swa6wso1_500jpg



she
took
me
straight
to
a
red
room
complete
with
red
floors
walls
everything
she
did
not
appear
to
me
this
time
she
remained
hidden
terrorizing
my
mind
the
messages
i
remember
receiving
were
\x93confront
me
and
\x93what
do
you
think
i
am
she
really
wanted
to
talk
to
me
but
i
soon
realized
that
i
have
the
power
to
make
her
leave
so
i
forced
her
out
the
only
energy
i
received
from
her
was
mischievous
and
evil
i
couldnt
force
myself
to
talk
to
her

i
then
discovered
that
this
phenomena
of
spirits
wanting
to
connect
with
us
is
probably
relatively
common
some
are
evil
some
are
good
and
some
are
neutral
whether
or
not
you
choose
to
let
them
harbor
around
is
up
to
you

the
rest
of
the
trip
was
very
strange
i
was
surrounded
by
several
unidentifiable
beings
i
laughed
at
my
childishness
immediately
recognizing
they
could
sense
my
feelings
of
discomfort


they
then
spoke
to
me

roughly
translated
\x93we
are
the
world
leaders
your
world
is
run
by
ours
we
have
been
watching
you
we
like
you
join
us
when
you
die
you
will
live
among
us


needless
to
say
i
was
overwhelmed
\x93why
me

no
answer

\x93im
down
im
down
im
down
then
laughing
at
my
overwhelmingly
confident
answer

\x93keep
your
pineal
gland
open
and
visit
us
again
they
said

6
month
note

this
was
a
connection
both
to
aliens
and
my
soul
they
were
inviting
me
\x93back
so
to
speak
if
i
refused
i
could
have
went
back
into
the
3d
realm
without
further
intervention
however
since
i
accepted
this
offer
i
invited
them
to
continue
playing
a
direct
role
in
my
life
read
the
conclusion
for
more
info

i
then
came
back
to
my
physical
room
excited
scared
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
it
human
beings
really
are
as
i
became
convinced
dumb
we
have
\x93gods
just
as
dogs
and
other
animals
view
us
and
others
as
such
all
of
my
beliefs
and
ideologies
were
shattered
but
i
couldnt
set
aside
what
they
said
to
me
i
had
to
do
dmt
again
this
time
would
be
orally
with
ayahuasca

i
prepared
my
ayahuasca
using
recipe
2
from
the
resonance
project
issue
2
winter
1997/98
ayahuasca
cookbook
replacing
mimosa
hostilis
with
acacia
confusa
but
only
15
grams

ayahuasca
experience

after
brewing
and
drinking
i
immediately
felt
as
if
something
was
going
to
happen
i
knew
i
was
on
the
brink
of
a
big
discovery
i
just
couldnt
figure
what
it
was
i
sat
out
on
my
porch
on
the
come
up
admiring
the
trees
in
the
distance
i
felt
as
if
i
were
making
a
connection
with
them
talking
to
them
loving
them
receiving
love
in
return
my
vision
began
getting
better
and
better
as
it
usually
does
with
dmt
seeing
intricate
details
on
the
roof
of
my
garage
every
spider
and
fly
that
came
nearby
i
told
the
mosquitoes
to
leave
me
alone
using
all
of
my
energy
and
they
did
i
broke
out
singing
opening
myself
up
to
the
spirit
world
almost
as
if
i
were
a
performing
a
ritual
to
welcome
the
spirits
i
began
thinking
more
in
the
moment
than
i
had
in
my
entire
life
cursing
phones
internet
and
social
media
if
anybody
needed
to
talk
to
me
they
could
come
meet
me
in
person
for
how
else
will
i
truly
be
able
to
communicate
with
them
roughly
1
hour
had
passed

i
then
saw
\x93mother
ayahuasca
she
welcomed
me
speaking
no
words
she
soon
disappeared
and
i
then
felt
i
was
supposed
to
go
back
inside
my
house
so
i
did
my
stomach
began
seering
with
pain
i
didnt
want
to
risk
throwing
up
any
of
the
huasca
so
i
sat
down
on
the
couch
in
my
living
room
a
few
of
my
friends
were
there
not
tripping
i
watched
one
of
them
play
video
games
for
about
15
minutes
eventually
losing
interest
in
the
utter
\x93fakeness
of
technology
these
revelations
still
hold
true
today
i
cant
play
video
games
or
use
technology
without
being
extremely
bored
perhaps
one
thing
ayahuasca
did
for
me
was
help
me
realize
how
\x93fake
they
are

the
next
hour
of
my
trip
i
felt
uncomfortable
with
my
current
situation
i
was
hard-pressed
trying
to
find
something
to
do
i
began
questioning
my
actions
heavily
everything
i
did
wasnt
\x93right
i
wandered
around
my
house
had
small
talk
with
my
friends
but
could
not
find
anything
\x93meaningful

then
it
peaked

about
4
hours
after
drinking
the
huasca
i
found
myself
parked
on
the
couch
in
my
living
room
talking
to
two
of
my
friends
intially
thinking
that
huasca
wouldnt
be
as
powerful
as
smoked
dmt
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
\x93blast
off
however
after
a
few
minutes
of
talking
my
head
gave
me
that
typical
\x93trip
feeling
this
time
it
was
more
intense
than
i
remember
it
being
but
i
wasnt
uncomfortable
i
closed
my
eyes
in
this
world
and
opened
them
in
another

i
then
remembered
as
i
usually
do
how
real
the
dmt
realm
is
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
being
in
a
spaceship
looking
at
me
right
in
the
eyes
see
picture
below
this
time
i
was
not
scared
or
uncomfortable
and
gave
my
best
energy
to
him
for
those
who
have
never
taken
dmt
imagine
\x93giving
good
energy
to
someone
as
simply
thinking
very
nice
thoughts
knowing
that
they
are
received
and
understood
immediately
when
i
made
his
presence
welcome
he
did
something
i
will
never
forget


still
looking
at
this
being
right
in
the
eyes
he
acknowledged
my
telepathic
message
and
smiled
at
me
i
saw
each
of
his
teeth
his
eyes
his
hair
his
clothing
and
the
intricate
details
of
the
ship
he
was
travelling
in
and
took
it
in
with
awe
knowing
that
this
experience
would
permanently
change
me
i
almost
couldnt
believe
this
had
just
happened
he
showed
me
the
bliss
that
will
come
after
death

<br/><br/>although
i
could
never
fully
describe
what
i
saw
the
being
looked
similar
to
this<br/><br/>http//wwwartoflegendindiacom/images/images_big/pbaac096_god_ramajpg



the
whole
time
this
was
happening
my
friends
were
still
sitting
next
to
me
on
the
couch
receiving
an
earful
about
what
i
was
seeing
i
understood
everything
i
was
fully
aware
at
this
point
that
i
was
still
in
my
body
and
said
in
a
loud
manner

\x93oh
my
god
\x93bros
\x93if
only
you
could
see
what
im
seeing
right
now
and
so
on

inevitably
my
enthusiasm
started
to
aggravate
them
and
they
walked
out
of
the
room
what
they
didnt
realize
is
that
i
was
still
going
up
the
being
flew
away
and
i
started
seeing
the
room
with
my
eyes
closed
i
saw
the
couch
i
was
sitting
on
the
painting
on
the
wall
in
front
of
me
and
could
see
all
energy
and
aura
around
me
i
was
more
comfortable
with
my
eyes
closed
than
i
would
normally
be
with
them
open
i
saw
better
my
thoughts
at
the
time
went
similar
to
this

\x93this
cannot
possibly
be
happening
right
now
\x93this
changes
everything
everything
\x93why
would
i
ever
open
my
eyes


i
was
raised
in
a
christian
home
and
was
always
relatively
passionate
about
god
and
the
teachings
of
jesus
but
this
changed
everything
i
began
to
not
be
sure
if
god
was
real
after
all
before
i
couldnt
comprehend
there
not
being
a
god
now
i
couldnt
imagine
there
being
a
\x93god
at
least
how
we
comprehend
it
all
in
the
matter
of
a
few
minutes
my
life
had
completely
changed

5
minutes
later
the
visions
started
to
go
away
but
not
the
effects
of
the
huasca
my
stomach
ache
turned
into
a
\x93you
need
to
puke
right
now
and
i
chucked
all
over
my
carpet
eventually
i
made
it
to
the
bathroom
and
put
the
rest
of
my
puke
in
the
toilet
i
have
read
that
puking
is
historically
referred
to
as
the
\x93purge
causing
you
to
fully
enter
the
huasca
realm
the
purge
was
not
pleasant
in
the
slightest
for
the
first
time
i
realized
what
it
really
means
to
be
alone


after
puking
roughly
5
hours
after
first
ingestion
i
thought
that
the
drug
was
subsiding
since
i
was
no
longer
getting
visuals
i
began
wandering
around
the
house
unsure
of
what
i
should
do
still
being
alone
i
decided
that
i
should
go
to
bed
i
normally
sleep
in
boxers/socks
but
for
some
reason
i
ended
up
completely
stripping
naked
i
laid
down
in
my
bed
for
one
second
and
immediately
recognized
i
was
supposed
to
do
something
else
i
wandered
around
my
house
some
more
and
began
to
feel
overwhelmed
by
the
sheer
power
of
the
huasca
i
ended
up
lying
down
in
the
kitchen
floor
completely
naked

i
thought
had
died
i
was
no
longer
part
of
my
body
however
it
was
not
me
that
was
\x93dying
it
was
all
of
my
family/friends
i
began
wondering
exactly
how
i
ended
up
in
my
current
situation
and
was
furious
at
myself
for
letting
it
come
to
this
i
truly
thought
i
was
about
to
cross
into
the
unknown
my
\x93last
words
were
an
apology
to
my
mother

\x93mom
please
forgive
me
i
promise
you
will
understand
when
you
die

the
stresses/emotions
that
occupy
this
life
were
trivial
i
didnt
care
about
any
of
my
possessions
none
of
them
indeed
i
was
going
to
lose
it
all
anyway
all
of
my
possessions
all
of
my
friends
my
family
even
the
memory
of
my
experiences
on
this
earth
for
the
first
time
death
made
complete
sense
i
was
on
an
individual
soul
journey

thankfully
my
roommate
came
back
home
and
found
me
in
the
shape
i
was
in
when
he
began
talking
to
me
i
realized
that
everything
might
come
back
i
tried
explaining
everything
that
was
happening

\x93i
think
i
just
died
\t\x93youre
not
dead
\x93really
when
am
i
going
to
die
\t\x93i
dont
know
\x93i
hope
i
die
soon

granted
i
am
not
a
dark
person
and
would
never
have
previously
been
interested
in
the
idea
of
taking
my
own
life
or
dying
in
general
after
my
roommate
came
back
i
realized
that
everything
was
going
to
be
alright
after
all
and
eventually
was
able
to
go
to
sleep

3-month
aftermath

as
i
write
this
3
months
after
my
last
dmt
experience
with
ayahuasca
i
could
not
begin
to
describe
the
positive
impact
it
has
had
on
my
life

i
could
not
begin
to
describe
the
positive
impact
it
has
had
on
my
life

i
had
undergone
a
2
year
depression
from
heartbreak
i
had
constant
stress
to
pay
for
my
car/rent
and
to
my
discovery
was
not
happy
at
all

after
dmt
all
of
this
was
gone
i
was
reborn
my
thoughts
were
changed
viewing
everything
differently
yet
always
in
a
positive
manner
now
i
live
my
life
without
stress
worry
or
pain
i
am
permanently
content
i
still
do
not
believe
in
religion
but
view
this
as
simply
an
act
of
growing
up
i
once
read
a
great
quote
that
holds
true
to
my
current
belief

\x93religion
is
regarded
by
the
common
people
as
true
by
the
wise
as
false
and
by
the
rulers
as
useful

6-month
aftermath

for
the
purpose
of
helping
others
know
what
they
might
be
getting
themselves
into
with
dmt
i
will
now
list
the
irreversible
\x93facts
that
i
have
come
to
in
the
long-term
since
i
have
tried
the
substance




the
simple
fact
about
dmt
and
other
psychedelics
is
that
it
essentially
alters
your
dna
i
have
always
perceived
these
changes
to
be
for
the
better
as

i
feel
i
have
all
the
answers
within
myself
i
stopped
believing
in
coincidences
i
stopped
looking
to
others
or
the
internet
for
answers
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
humanity
and
our
science
is
unbelievably
primitive
additionally
i
immediately
stop
using
any
substances
marijuana
is
my
favorite
after
using
dmt
for
at
least
2
weeks
dmt
teaches
people
how
to
live
their
life
so
please
note
my
experience
may
not
align
with
another
souls


i
only
tell
my
close
friends
about
dmt
for
once
you
tried
it
i
realized
that
i
had
completely
separated
myself
from
society
i
almost
put
myself
on
a
higher
level
than
others
not
ego-related
i
simply
realize
that
most
of
the
world
will
never
begin
to
comprehend
or
understand
my
deepest
beliefs
i
was
able
to
witness
a
change
in
my
personality
over
the
past
6
months
and
have
even
been
asked
a
couple
times
\x93what
happened
to
you
i
laugh
on
the
inside
every
time
as
i
withhold
my
deepest
secrets

contact
with
inter-dimensional
beings
has
not
ceased
let
me
just
say
that
aliens
are
real
they
are
here
and
ready
to
communicate
with/help
all
of
us
they
are
simply
non-interventionist
and
wont
communicate
with
us
if
they
perceive
that
any
information
they
give
us
will
be
of
any
harm
mentally
they
are
well
aware
of
all
of
us
know
all
of
our
deepest
secrets
and
have
evolved
to
a
dimension
where
time/space
is
null
they
live
they
die
they
have
problems
and
they
feel
pain
just
not
nearly
at
the
level
humans
do

after
further
soul-searching
i
discovered
what
i
am
that
past
lives
i
have
experienced
and
why
i
am
here
i
only
notice
the
communications
with
these
beings
and
with
my
higher-self
the
\x93soul
when
i
am
able
to
clear
my
mind
and
listen
to
my
thoughts
for
i
promise
they
are
not
simply
composed
in
your
brain
your
brain
is
a
telephone

i
will
not
go
into
exact
details
as
to
what
i
am
for
i
am
told
to
keep
these
things
secret
i
guess
you
could
call
me
a
spy
all
i
can
say
is
that
my
soul
is
not
human
and
i
am
here
to
help
earth
with
the
ascension
process
that
is
happening
now
by
spreading
love
and
light
however
what
is
most
important
to
note
is
that
since
i
have
made
contact
with
these
higher-powers
i
have
developed
several
psychic
abilities

i
have
developed
several
psychic
abilities



these
abilities
came
at
me
very
slowly
as
they
were
not
intended
to
overwhelm
or
cause
me
any
discomfort
i
can
read
peoples
minds
i
often
know
what
somebody
is
going
to
say
before
they
say
it
i
can
even
implant
thoughts
into
others
this
is
really
useful
when
i
want
to
help
someone
on
their
soul
journey
i
can
look
at
someone
in
the
eyes
and
read
their
deepest
emotions
i
have
a
sense
of
when
something
is
about
to
happen
and
can
contact
certain
alien
species
at
will
of
course
these
revelations
cause
others
around
me
to
be
skeptical
but
i
am
always
able
to
prove
myself
most
interesting
i
have
been
told
that
i
will
continue
to
discover
further
gifts
throughout
my
life
when
i
am
ready



conclusion<br/><br/>although
permanently
altered
from
my
dmt
experiences
i
would
highly
suggest
anyone
to
try
it
as
long
as
you
want
to
if
you
are
unsure
or
unwilling
save
yourself
the
ego-death
and
simply
dont
in
his
book
dmt
the
spirit
molecule
rick
straussman
theorizes
that
every
human
being
trips
dmt
at
least
three
times
in
their
life
40
days
after
conception
during
birth
and
during
their
death
the
molecule
is
produced
in
our
brain
and
secreted
by
the
pineal
gland
near-death
experiences
and
deep
meditation
can
cause
a
dmt
excretion
if
you
are
unsure
about
taking
the
drug
you
arent
ready
for
it
besides
youll
be
enlightened
at
some
point
anyway

background
nn-dmt
dmt
in
its
freebase
form
is
known
to
be
soluble
in
propylene
glycol

with
the
emergence
of
electronic
cigarettes
e-cigs
or
vapes
and
a
wide
variety
of
juices
available
theres
a
degree
of
variance
of
pg
-
i
read
that
30-50%
pg
is
usually
a
good
amount

dmt
was
my
first
psychedelic
and
probably
the
one
i
have
the
most
experience
with
i
have
been
making
it
and
consulted
on
its
manufacture
for
about
55
years
with
countless
dmt
trips
under
my
belt
and
a
handful
of
memorable
ones
and
many
friendships
made
along
the
way
my
main
method
of
smoking
was
the
sandwich
method
dmt
between
layers
of
leafy
substrate
before
i
discovered
this
way
now
i
dont
think
ill
go
back
to
the
old
ways

---
prep
work
---

method
and
equipment

i
had
recently
extracted
a
large
quantity
of
dmt
using
a
straight-to-base
technique
from
mimosa
hostilis
rootbark
mhrb
to
ensure
i
only
got
nn-dmt
as
the
primary
alkaloid
from
100
grams
of
finely
shredded
and
powdered
mhrb
225
grams
of
dmt
freebase
crystals
were
yielded
mainly
white
with
a
trace
yellow
at
parts
and
no
tan

the
vape
fluid
i
had
chosen
was
one
of
70%
vg
30%
pg
mint
flavored
to
mask
the
strong
flavor
of
dmt
with
0%
nicotine
to
keep
the
experience
pure
it
was
the
highest
pg
the
shop
had
in
that
flavor
i
used
a
tank
with
a
stainless
steel
coil
on
a
temperature
controlled
device
designed
to
handle
stainless
steel
coils
the
temperature
was
set
to
520
degrees
fahrenheit
at
600
watts
i
used
an
80w
power
mod
which
was
chosen
for
its
high
capacity
internal
battery
and
temperature
control
settings
i
primed
the
coil
with
the
fluid
and
ensured
its
full
saturation
before
adding
dmt-laden
fluid
to
the
tank

the
tank
has
the
advantage
of
being
easy
to
fill
and
add
dmt
to
while
the
tank
was
not
completely
full
i
proceeded
to
slowly
and
carefully
add
400mg
of
dmt
to
3ml
of
e-cig
fluid
initially
the
dmt
did
not
dissolve
immediately
stuck
to
the
top
of
the
tanks
edges
which
reminded
me
of
how
margaritas
are
served
with
salt
on
the
rim
and
it
appeared
to
be
somewhat
of
a
sludge
in
the
mixture
i
ran
hot
water
over
the
tank
and
shook
it
vigorously
and
rotated
it
frequently
until
some
of
the
larger
particles
began
to
dissolve
upon
firing
the
pre-soaked
coil
and
taking
a
couple
test
hits
the
solution
cleared
up
and
the
dmt
was
fully
dissolved
the
solution
turned
from
clear/white
to
a
light
pale
yellow

alternatively
i
would
recommend
mixing
the
e-cig
fluid
and
dmt
in
a
test
tube
and
gently
heating
it
until
its
dissolved
and
preparing
a
sort
of
mother
liquor
through
this
manner

experience
---

1st
puff
-
i
inhale
for
about
3
to
5
seconds
and
hold
for
about
5
to
8
i
taste
mainly
mint
and
i
am
not
sure
if
the
dmt
has
vaporized
sufficiently
i
faintly
smell
it
and
taste
it
on
the
exhale
but
what
i
mainly
taste
and
smell
is
mint
it
feels
like
im
inhaling
peppermint
mouthwash
i
feel
the
effects
faintly

2nd
puff
-
i
inhale
as
i
did
before
this
time
the
smell
of
the
dmt
was
a
little
stronger
but
not
by
much
the
taste
was
not
significantly
different
from
the
previous
hit
i
feel
the
effects
a
bit
more
heavily
and
get
a
hint
or
idea
that
it
doesnt
behave
the
same
way
as
burning
it
in
a
bowl
sandwiched
between
two
layers
does
the
effects
creep
up
then
intensify
somewhat

3rd
puff
-
the
smell
of
dmt
did
not
change
from
the
last
hit
nor
did
the
taste
the
effects
become
much
more
pronounced
as
does
the
way
it
hits
me
it
has
somewhat
of
a
delayed
effect
which
i
suspect
is
from
the
pg
-
i
think
the
pg
dissolves
in
the
lungs
first
and
then
the
dmt
follows
shortly
after
it
would
explain
the
ramped
and
lagged/delayed
feeling
i
get
it
seems
like
the
dmt
will
begin
to
be
felt
a
couple
seconds
after
the
inhale
but
doesnt
fully
kick
in
until
about
5-10
seconds
later
it
is
important
to
take
the
hits
back-to-back
so
as
to
meet
the
time
frame
for
the
dmt
breakthrough
the
ringing
in
my
ears
begins
to
become
more
apparent

4th
&
5th
puffs
-
feels
the
same
as
earlier
inhaling
but
i
inhale
differently
and
more
deeply
holding
my
breath
a
bit
longer
these
puffs
hit
harder
than
the
first
three
i
exhale
and
take
the
5th
puff
identically
as
i
can
to
the
4th
as
i
am
closing
my
eyes
i
begin
to
feel
the
4th
puff
slam
me
then
i
thought
about
that
5th
puff
i
just
took
and
the
amount
of
time
delay
between
the
two
was
the
same
time
delay
between
the
slammed/ramped
feels
of
it
the
ringing
in
my
ears
from
the
3rd
puff
intensified
significantly
after
the
4th
puff
and
by
the
time
the
5th
puff
hit
it
was
almost
the
ringing
got
loud
for
a
quick
moment
then
stopped
i
think
i
broke
through

time
dilated
significantly
by
this
point
and
i
felt
in
awe
at
what
i
had
created
the
background
on
my
computer
looked
cartoonish
and
i
could
not
convince
myself
that
the
trees
i
was
seeing
in
it
werent
cell-shaded
the
clock
seemed
to
hang
at
110am
for
what
felt
like
hours
and
i
looked
at
the
tie-dye
tapestry
on
my
wall
and
saw
many
geometric
patterns
of
arrows
pointing
towards
its
center
closed-eye
visuals
were
as
complex
and
stunning
as
they
were
beautiful
111am
went
by
more
quickly
than
110
did
by
120am
i
was
feeling
mostly
back
to
normal

extensions
and
commentary
i
think
this
is
really
a
game-changer
in
a
lot
of
ways
its
discrete
and
stealthy
its
very
convenient
and
easy
to
use
and
its
much
easier
and
more
reliable
to
break
through
this
way
than
any
other
method
i
have
tried
i
wish
i
had
made
it
at
500mg/3ml
instead
of
400mg
temperature
control
means
you
run
a
much
lower
risk
of
burning
your
dmt


its
really
slick
in
a
lot
of
ways
and
the
only
downside
i
see
is
the
lag
effect
can
creep
up
on
newbies
with
the
lag/delay
response
from
hitting
it




rolling
dmt
into
cigarettes

i
have
been
smoking
dmt
in
a
fairly
ritualized
but
informal
spiritual
context
for
the
past
4
or
5
years
and
feel
as
though
it
is
the
best
way
to
gain
insight
into
the
nature
of
reality
as
it
exists
beyond
human
perception
i
always
keep
a
pen
and
paper
handy
which
has
allowed
me
to
occasionally
bring
back
an
intangible
fragment
or
two
in
the
form
of
ideas
of
what
i
feel
a
little
bit
silly
describing
as
the
transcendent
oneness
of
our
fundamentally
sentient
universe

an
issue
has
been
that
my
pipe
set-up
is
so
effective
that
it
becomes
easy
to
accidentally
stumble
into
breakthrough
territory
when
im
not
necessarily
in
the
right
state
of
mind
for
it

sometimes
when
i
feel
like
smoking
dmt
i
am
only
really
seeking
a
glimpse
as
a
reminder
that
there
is
something
existing
beyond
us

the
accidental
breakthrough
experiences
ive
had
when
not
in
a
good
state
of
mind
have
been
rather
unpleasant
and
i
have
for
a
long
time
wanted
to
find
a
way
to
smoke
it
more
casually
in
a
way
that
would
reliably
produce
less
intense
effects

i
have
for
a
long
time
wanted
to
find
a
way
to
smoke
it
more
casually
in
a
way
that
would
reliably
produce
less
intense
effects



last
night
i
included
roughly
the
amount
i
would
smoke
in
my
pipe
into
a
roll-your-own
cigarette
distributed
evenly
throughout
the
length
of
the
roll
and
sandwiched
between
two
layers
of
tobacco
this
was
then
attached
to
a
rolled
up
index
card
holder
to
be
more
easily
held
and
less
harsh

i
went
outside
sat
down
and
lit
it
up

after
1
or
2
small
drags
i
began
to
taste
the
dmt
and
the
smoke
had
that
warm
light
feel
to
it
so
i
held
it
in
for
about
10
seconds

the
familiar
warmth
and
physical
heaviness
i
associate
with
low
doses
of
dmt
began
to
settle
in
as
well
as
a
clarity
from
the
tobacco

as
i
continued
to
smoke
i
gradually
climbed
into
the
dmt
frame
of
mind
which
seemed
to
prevent
the
negative
side
effects
of
smoking
too
much
tobacco

the
dmt
and
the
nicotine
seemed
to
have
something
of
a
synergistic
effect
and
i
received
a
calm
light
emptiness
and
connectedness
to
my
outdoor
moonlit
setting
that
i
could
only
describe
as
true
bliss

not
euphoria
per
say
but
a
sense
of
peace
and
contentedness
that
was
so
complete
as
to
make
me
smile
broadly

in
the
shadows
cast
by
the
moon
i
could
see
the
beginning
of
typical
dmt
visuals
so
i
kept
smoking
and
increased
the
intensity
a
bit
more

at
this
point
it
felt
similar
to
a
super
tranquil
really
strong
acid
trip
when
such
a
thing
occurs

i
spaced
out
for
a
while
staring
at
the
stars
knowing
in
a
very
deep
and
pure
way
that
everything
was
connected
by
light
as
though
every
beam
was
some
cosmic
signal
connecting
the
synapses
and
neurons
of
some
all
inclusive
cosmic
entity
of
pure
existence
that
is
contained
in
the
universe
the
way
our
selves
are
contained
in
our
brains

i
wont
go
too
much
further
into
what
was
a
very
clear-headed
train
of
cosmic
rumination
and
philosophizing
since
it
is
not
what
i
sought
out
to
report

what
i
did
seek
to
report
was
that
for
me
dmt
was
extremely
smokable
and
could
conceivably
be
done
so
in
either
tobacco
or
cannabis
cigarettes

it
gave
me
a
means
of
controlling
the
intensity
of
a
low
dose
dmt
trip
making
much
more
conducive
to
writing
painting
etc



i
ought
to
mention
though
that
at
one
point
when
the
effects
were
at
their
strongest
i
tried
to
stand
up
to
take
a
leak
and
found
myself
very
physically
weighed
down
and
clumsy
so
anything
requiring
physical
coordination
could
potentially
be
dangerous

although
blasting
off
into
a
breakthrough
experience
is
the
single
most
profound
type
of
experience
ive
had
in
life
i
think
from
now
on
for
the
most
part
i
will
be
smoking
dmt
rolled
into
joints
of
cigarettes
since
it
was
much
more
well
suited
to
creative
activity
and
it
has
been
much
easier
to
actually
integrating
the
experience




ive
always
been
interested
in
psychedelics
and
in
my
life
i
had
the
chance
to
experience
quite
extensively
with
mushrooms
amanitas
san
pedro
and
a
small
dose
of
lsd
once


i
work
as
a
medicinal
chemist
at
a
major
pharma
company
and
lately
i
got
interested
in
the
synthesis
of
the
reatively
simple
structurally
nn-dimethyltryptamine
i
was
checking
the
companys
chemical
database
when
i
noticed
that
tryptamine
a
close
precursor
of
dmt
was
readily
available
on
the
shelf
the
reaction
leading
to
the
nn-dimethylated
analogue
dmt
is
a
simple
reductive
amination
where
the
two
hydrogen
atoms
on
a
nitrogen
of
tryptamine
are
replaced
by
two
methyl
groups
ch3
having
attempted
the
synthesis
twice
now
i
can
say
that
most
of
the
recipes
found
on
the
internet
are
incomplete
or
in
some
cases
complete
bollocks


first
of
all
tryptamine
oxidises
quite
easily
on
the
shelf
turning
to
a
deep
orange/brown
colour
if
this
is
the
case
it
needs
recrystallizing
from
boiling
heptane
or
hexane
heptane
slightly
better
the
yield
for
each
recryst
is
quite
shit
and
it
might
be
necessary
to
repeat
the
process
on
the
leftover
orange
crap
once
recrystallised
tryptamine
looks
like
soft
flat
large
waxy
white
crystals


now
for
the
solvent
used
i
saw
many
reports
saying
that
methanol
is
a
good
solvent
for
the
dimethylation
i
tried
it
and
about
30
mins
into
the
reaction
a
precipitate
forms
and
the
overall
time
of
reaction
and
yields
are
greatly
reduced
because
of
this
best
solvent
i
used
is
thf
this
is
the
key
to
high
yields
and
purity
of
final
product
as
for
the
reducing
agent
sodium
cyanoborohydride
works
just
as
well
as
the
milder
sodiumtriacetoxyborohydride
stab
and
i
generally
use
25
equivalents
for
the
first
one
and
about
4
equivalents
for
the
latter
based
on
moles
of

tryptamine
addition
of
acid
say
2
eq
max
is
necessary
as
this
cuts
on
reaction
time
greatly
i
used
glacial
acetic
acid
for
this
and
it
works
great


any
formaldehyde/water
solution
will
do
i
used
5
equivalents
based
on
tryptamine
now
for
the
order
of
addition
of
reagents
i
saw
reports
were
ppl
were
strongly
advising
to
cool
the
reaction
mixture
prior
to
the
addition
of
formaldehyde
to
the
mixture
of
solvent
tryptamine
acid
and
reducing
agent
this
is
true
only
for
very
large
scale
reactions
but
is
nothing
to
be
worried
about
when
working
with
a
few
grams
of
starting
material


in
thf
my
reaction
took
less
than
2
hours
to
go
to
completion
by
lc-ms
work
up
was
as
following
removed
thf
by
evaporation
or
rotavap
added
1m
hcl
solution
to
the
crude
mixture
and
placed
whitish
solution
in
a
separatory
funnel
washed
the
aqueous
phase
with
ethyl
acetate
do
not
use
dcm
even
tho
it
evaporates
easily
it
forms
big
emulsions
during
the
separation
which
complicates
things
and
the
organic
layer
discarded
now
the
water
phase
was
made
basic
by
the
addition
of
2m
koh
white
precipitate
starts
forming
and
washed
again
twice
with
ethyl
acetate
now
the
water
phase
was
discarded
the
ethyl
acetate
dried
on
sodium
sulfate
and
the
solvent
removed
by
evaporation
leaving
a
clear
slightly
yellow
oil
which
foamed
under
high
vacuum
pump
now
the
choice
is
yours
you
can
either
smoke
this
as
it
is
contains
impurities
or
try
and
recrystallise
it
from
boiling
hexane
or
heptane
not
so
easy
as
described
on
the
net
or
even
column
it
5-10%
methanol

a
few

added
should
do
the
job
and

you

now
for
my
experiences
first
time
i
tried
30mg
smoked
i
felt
a
general
light
headiness
like
10
seconds
after
inhaling
and
the
light
in
the
room
started
to
become
more
intense
i
felt
giggly
and
active
and
was
getting
slight
cold
shivers
on
my
body
after
max
15
minutes
the
effects
vanished
completely


second
time
i
decide
to
try
it
properly
a
70mg
trip
however
at
the
moment
i
havent
got
the
right
equipment
for
smoking
it
so
i
made
a
spoon
out
of
some
aluminium
foil
and
inhaled
the
fumes
generated
by
heating
the
bottom
of
the
spoon
with
a
lighter
the
smoke
tastes
exactly
as
the
crystals
smell
a
typical
indole
scent
i
didnt
mind
it
because
of
my
shitty
apparatus
i
didnt
inhale
all
of
the
smoke
however
10
seconds
later
my
mind
was
racing
at
incredible
speeds
and
i
got
a
bit
freaked
out


i
lied
down
worried
that
this
was
gonna
last
for
an
entire
hour
but
i
managed
to
snap
out
of
it
in
no
time
i
was
then
tripping
real
hard
with
visuals
both
with
my
eyes
opened
and
closed
it
was
great
much
better
than
mushrooms
as
it
feels
more
linear
synthetic
less
introspective
and
with
much
wilder
visuals
the
best
thing
was
that
after
20mins
i
was
already
coming
down
with
very
little
side
effects
after
one
hour
i
was
feeling
calm
and
relaxed
and
i
smoked
a
big
joint
nice
experience
although
i
dont
think
it
would
suit
the
weak
hearted






this
report
was
recounted
to
me
by
a
dear
friend
who
wishes
to
remain
anonymous
for
legal
reasons<br/><br/>
i
had
some
reduced
acacia
confusa
brew
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
after
i
made
a
large
batch
of
ayahuasca
for
myself
and
some
friends
and
was
curious
about
what
i
should
do
with
it
since
i
wasnt
quite
prepared
to
subject
my
body
to
the
ayahuasca
body-load
again
so
soon
i
decided
that
an
ab
extract
tek
would
probably
be
my
best
bet

i
had
a
large
half-gallon
mason
jar
full
of
the
thick
syrupy
goodness
about
150g
worth
of
confusa
boiled
3
times
and
then
reduced
so
i
transferred
everything
to
a
large
glass
mixing
bowl
to
combine
my
ingredients
i
mixed
in
about
100-125g
of
pickling
lime
caoh2
and
stirred
until
the
mixture
was
roughly
the
consistency
of
thick
stew
and
all
the
clumps
of
lime
were
broken
down
when
this
was
done
i
transferred
the
mixture
back
into
the
mason
jar
leaving
a
bit
of
room
at
the
top
of
the
jar
for
my
solvent
while
this
was
all
going
on
i
had
my
crock
pot
full
to
the
top
with
water
and
heating
up
once
it
got
hot
not
too
hot
solvents
are
flammable
i
took
off
the
lid
and
placed
the
jar
inside
after
a
minute
or
so
i
began
pouring
naphtha
into
the
top
of
the
jar
until
it
was
about
full
after
putting
the
lid
back
on
i
proceeded
to
gently
turn
over
and
mix
the
liquids
every
minute
or
so
while
the
crock
pot
heated
up
the
jar
after
about
10
minutes
of
this
more
doesnt
hurt
but
10
minutes
worth
is
about
all
the
solvent
can
pull
i
poured
the
naphtha
off
the
top
through
a
fine
paper
coffee
filter
into
a
pyrex
baking
dish
the
dish
was
then
covered
and
put
into
the
freezer
to
precipitate


the
next
morning
i
went
to
the
freezer
expecting/hoping
to
find
a
small
amount
of
useable
product
what
i
found
was
astounding
the
entire
surface
of
the
dish
was
blanketed
in
fluffy
white
crystals
with
my
first
pull
i
ended
up
getting
over
400
mg
and
my
next
few
pulls
gave
me
about
the
same
with
my
stocks
of
freebase
newly
filled
up
i
decided
it
was
time
to
give
it
a
try

i
packed
up
a
small
acrylic
water
pipe
with
two
layers
of
ashes
and
about
50mg
of
crystals
sandwiched
between
once
i
had
meditated
for
long
enough
to
calm
my
mind
i
took
the
first
hit
i
immediately
tasted
the
acrid
plastic-y
dmt
smoke
and
knew
i
was
in
for
something
huge
as
soon
as
i
exhaled
i
took
another
quick
little
hit
to
ensure
that
i
blasted
off
fully
within
twenty
seconds
of
taking
my
second
hit
the
immensely
familiar
sensation
of
tightening
in
the
muscles
of
my
face
and
chest
started
to
take
hold
i
began
to
feel
as
if
a
very
gentle
pair
of
hands
was
pulling
me
out
of
my
body
and
i
did
my
best
not
to
fight
it
as
soon
as
i
left
my
body
i
began
to
feel
it
melting
away
and
the
journey
began


i
hurtled
through
time
and
space
at
what
seemed
to
be
impossible
speeds
yet
at
the
same
time
i
knew
that
i
had
not
really
moved
at
all
that
the
adventure
was
just
beginning
i
came
to
a
vast
wall
and
i
couldnt
move
or
see
past
it
a
deep
piercing
voice
echoed
into
my
very
soul
from
the
wall
\x93if
you
wish
to
go
further
then
what
is
your
answer
without
thinking
i
replied
\x93question
as
if
this
were
a
secret
password
of
some
sort
i
felt
myself
being
forced
into
a
small
chamber
and
shot
through
the
wall
as
if
through
a
cannon
i
flew
for
what
seemed
like
ages
until
i
crashed
into
a
barrier
of
some
sort
and
stopped
abruptly
from
where
i
was
in
my
little
interdimensional
escape
pod
of
sorts
i
could
see
a
small
crack
of
light
i
crawled
from
the
wreckage
of
my
pod
and
forced
myself
through
the
crack
it
seemed
to
take
years
to
get
through
it
like
i
was
a
square
peg
trying
to
fit
through
a
round
hole


once
i
did
emerge
though
i
was
treated
to
the
most
incredible
landscape
i
have
ever
encountered
the
sky
was
like
a
pearl
filled
with
crimson
blood
and
i
immediately
knew
that
i
was
not
on
my
home
planet
anymore
there
were
trees
or
at
least
trees
are
the
closest
thing
i
could
compare
them
to
hundreds
of
feet
high
and
glowing
in
the
most
magnificent
fluorescent
colors
imaginable
i
was
only
able
to
look
around
for
a
few
seconds
before
i
got
the
feeling
that
i
was
no
longer
alone
in
my
little
forest
clearing
i
turned
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
being
so
incomprehensible

that
the
instant
i
looked
at
its
\x93face
i
immediately
felt
myself
cast
all
the
way
back
into
my
body


to
this
day
i
cant
properly
describe
the
feeling
that
being
made
me
feel
it
was
if
i
was
so
unworthy
that
i
was
not
even
permitted
to
be
aware
of
its
presence
a
truly
humbling
experience
to
cap
off
what
was
by
far
the
most
profound
and
thought-provoking
trip
i
have
ever
been
on
i
hope
that
this
report
can
help
some
of
my
fellow
psychonauts
on
the
path
to
whatever
it
is
that
they
might
be
seeking
as
long
as
you
have
experiences
and
knowledge
to
share
your
journey
can
never
end
badly




i
am
an
experienced
drug
user
i
have
tried
most
things
such
as
the
classical
drugs
like
weed
mushrooms
lsd
mdma
heroin
amphetamine
and
methamphetamine
and
the
newer
research
chemicals
like
the
nbome
series
mephedrone
methylone
4-mec
among
others

i
also
have
had
prior
experiences
with
smoking
dmt
of
which
i
usually
broke
through
and
saw
beings
at
about
the
30-40
mg
dose


mindset
and
setting
i
am
a
very
calm
person
when
im
tripping
i
can
talk
myself
from
a
bad
trip
i
have
done
ten-strips
before
and
massive
doses
of
2c-e
and
did
not
require
a
trip-sitter
i
usually
do
have
a
trip-sitter
but
never
required
one
i
am
unusually
calm
and
collected
even
during
a
bad
trip
my
mindset
at
the
time
of
this
experience
was
likewise
calm

i
was
alone
during
this
experience
i
estimate
the
dose
to
be
about
10
mg
based
on
previous
experiences
furthermore
i
am
a
trained
chemist
and
know
the
sizes
of
doses
and
powders
quite
well
i
do
not
recommend
anyone
else
to
eyeball
doses

[erowid
note
two
samples
of
powder
even
of
the
same
chemical
with
equivalent
volumes
wont
necessarily
weigh
the
same
for
this
reason
eyeballing
is
an
inaccurate
and
potentially
dangerous
method
of
measuring
particularly
for
substances
that
are
active
in
very
small
amountssee

preparation
15-20
mg
of
freebase
dmt
powder
was
suspended
in
sterile
water
a
minute
quantity
of
citric
acid
was
added
the
solution
was
heated
until
the
powder
dissolved
the
dmt
was
observed
to
have
changed
into
an
oil
citric
acid
was
added
and
the
solution
heated
until
the
dmt
oil
had
dissipated
it
should
be
noted
that
it
is
very
easy
to
add
too
much
citric
acid
as
i
had
done
the
solution
was
filtered
through
a
cotton
into
a
syringe
with
a
25
gauge
needle
the
air
in
the
syringe
was
pushed
out

i
with
a
alcohol
swab
an
injection
site
in
my
elbow
was
cleaned
i
put
on
the
tourniquet
i
stretched
the
skin
where
the
vein
was
to
prevent
the
vein
from
rolling
i
then
stuck
the
needle
in
until
a
flash
of
blood
came
through
the
tourniquet
was
loosened
i
slowly
injected
about
half
of
the
dose
maybe
a
little
more


the
citric
acid
caused
a
burning
and
pressure
sensation
as
it
pumped
through
the
vein
this
is
the
danger
of
using
too
much
citric
acid
be
careful

experience


0
seconds
i
immediately
noticed
a
change
in
consciousness
it
was
not
so
much
seeing
anything
or
feeling
anything
just
an
awareness
that
i
wasnt
in
kansas
anymore


10
seconds
theres
a
vividness
of
color
in
everything
i
look
at
a
faint
sense
of
the
lightest
vibration
through
every
fiber
of
my
body

15
seconds
a
buzzing
is
getting
louder
and
louder
in
my
ear
my
perception
was
that
this
was
very
gradual
but
in
reality
only
took
a
couple
seconds
to
build
to
a
profuse
part
of
the
experience

im
starting
to
see
the
familiar
kaleidoscope
patterns
dmt
creates
i
feel
this
sense
that
the
nymph-like
beings
i
have
known
from
previous
experiences
are
surrounding
me

i
feel
this
sense
that
the
nymph-like
beings
i
have
known
from
previous
experiences
are
surrounding
me

theyre
ethereal
only
making
their
presence
known
through
the
vibes
of
energy


the
next
5
or
so
minutes

as
the
buzzing
grows
louder
and
the
patterns
more
complex
i
start
to
lose
my
footing
in
reality
i
feel
a
shift
like
being
transported
very
suddenly
on
a
rocket
ship
into
a
different
universe


the
loud
buzzing
was
almost
a
warning
to
the
being
launched
into
hyperspace
the
patterns
would
cycle
revolve
and
after
a
moment
of
cycling
and
revolving
they
would
grow
more
complex
cycle
and
revolve
again
this
continued
for
a
while
in
a
sense
it
was
like
climbing
up
stairs
rather
than
a
gradual
rise
to
the
peak

likewise
i
felt
this
sense
that
the
patterns
were
buzzing
on
my
face
this
is
hard
to
describe
but
if
you
texturized
the
patterns
i
saw
it
felt
as
if
they
were
massaging
my
face
like
this

indeed
this
feeling
of
cleanliness
washed
over
my
body
throughout
my
gi
system
it
felt
like
a
spiritual
cleansing
was
going
on
as
far
as
the
physical
feeling
it
was
kind
of
like
being
empty
but
burpy
this
same
feeling
is
a
very
minor
side
effect
of
ssris
when
i
first
start
them


the
effects
subsided
gradually
much
the
same
way
as
smoking

smoking
vs
iv

smoking
is
a
slower
onset
it
tends
to
burn
up
my
throat
and
lungs
which
can
be
distracting
when
im
busy
being
launched
into
hyperspace
this
is
the
main
advantage
of
iv

i
think
iv
left
me
feeling
more
calm
and
happy
than
smoking
as
odd
as
it
is
coming
out
of
the
trip
i
felt
quite
a
bit
happier
and
at
peace
while
i
get
this
feeling
on
smoking
too
not
quite
like
iv

until
now
i
always
associated
the
weird
serotonin
feel
in
my
gi
system
as
body
load
this
paired
with
the
lips
mouth
throat
and
lungs
being
scorched
by
the
freebase
makes
it
an
easy
association
perhaps
some
degraded
freebase
was
also
having
an
effect
the
body
load
i
got
on
iv
dmt
however
was
neutral
if
not
somewhat
pleasant

conclusion
iv
dmt
has
many
many
pros
it
doesnt
smell
it
is
easier
to
stick
myself
with
a
needle
than
it
is
to
reluctantly
huff
the
hot
noxious
burning
mothball-tasting
dmt
vapor
it
take
somewhere
between
half
to
a
quarter
of
the
dose
probably
because
its
not
decomposing
so
much


the
main
cons
are
that
there
are
numerous
steps
to
preparing
an
injection
and
the
health
risks
if
done
correctly
the
health
risks
are
almost
zilch
it
is
certainly
more
economical
too
my
dose
was
so
small
i
refused
to
believe
i
took
enough
for
a
breakthrough
until
i
was
seeing
a
nymph
gazing
at
me
through
space

will
i
do
this
again
hell
yes
it
may
be
a
while
before
i
do
it
again
but
i
will
never
smoke
dmt
after
having
done
an
iv
of
it


no
doubt
this
is
the
best
route
for
the
cautious
but
prepared
users
out
there




new
tec
for
dmt

i
am
a
metaphysics
teacher
my
studies
have
lead
me
to
some
discoveries
that
i
can
share
here
about
dmt
i
came
to
this
study
as
i
am
of
a
scientific
mind
and
in
order
to
teach
something
i
needed
to
know
it
was
true
in
most
cases
though
i
believe
what
i
was
teaching
much
of
it
was
for
other
sources
i
was
simply
at
the
point
that
i
needed
first
hand
experience
and
this
also
meant
objective
evidence
this
study
is
still
ongoing
as
the
criteria
for
a
test
needs
to
be
high
enough
for
proof
for
me
either
way
the
study
did
lead
to
trying
dmt
and
other
hallucinogenic
to
see
what
may
be
learned
again
this
experience
was
more
subjective
for
the
most
part
but
there
is
some
evidence
that
may
come
through
with
this
new
tec
that
can
be
examined
as
for
my
proof
i
am
hopeful
that
some
information
i
got
during
a
ayahuasca
ceremony
will
pan
out

here
is
the
tec
first



you
need

dmt
crystals


there
are
several
tecs
out
on
how
to
get
this
though
some
get
a
bit
to
long
and
have
some
extra
steps

i
will
put
my
method
at
the
end
of
this
article
for
those
interested
but
that
is
not
the
main
premise
of
this
writing

next


you
need

one
of
the
electronic
cigarettes
this
is
one
that
has
a
holder
for
the
vaporizing
liquid
in
a
separate
holder
that
is
screwed
onto
the
vaporizer
so
you
can
add
any
liquid
you
like


here
is
a
link
to
the
type
i
am
using

http//wwwbigboxsavecom/ce4-atomizer-replacement-for-ego-t-ego-c-ego-w-ego-series-e-cigarette-5pcs-lothtml
note
i
just
searched
google
for
a
image
and
do
not
promote
any
brand



now
the
liquid
what
i
am
using
is
a
standard

glycerin
with
no
nicotine
in
the
flavor
of
indigo
dream
what
i
have
found
is
that
the
dmt
crystals
will
dissolve
in
this
and
can
then
be
smoked
using
the
e-cigarette
this
has
lead
to
a
few
new
advantages
also
one
warning
the
plastic
holder
will
deteriorated
from
the
mixture
and
break
over
time
they
have
glass
ones
but
i
the
problem
is
not
that
bad



what
this
gives
you
first
you
can
make
the
liquid
as
strange
as
you
like

i
try
and
saturate
the
liquid
as
the
combination
is
not
as
strong
as
smoking
dmt
straight
this
advantage
is
also
found
that
it
is
easier
to
smoke


for
anyone
that
has
taken
pure
pure
dmt
vaporized
as
through
the
bottle
method
i
find
it
so
harsh
as
to
make
it
unusable
due
to
coughing
or
other
problems
in
the
interim
i
found
that
a
mixture
of
tobacco
and
pipe
was
easier
for
me
this
method
is
very
easy
though
a
large
inhale
can
still
make
me
cough
it
is
much
smoother
it
will
however
not
be
three
inhales
it
takes
a
lot
more
but
this
also
is
an
advantage

i
have
found
that
i
need
not
blast
myself
into
another
reality
to
get
a
lot
from
the
dmt

i
have
found
that
i
need
not
blast
myself
into
another
reality
to
get
a
lot
from
the
dmt

to
explore
such
things
more
that
test
need
to
be
done
so
with
this
method
i
can
take
a
bit
of
steps
at
a
time
and
see
what
i
experience
i
have
found
that
i
can
get
much
from
it
this
way
as
insights
come
to
me
that
i
may
have
otherwise
missed
also
i
have
found
some
consistency
that
may
lead
to
objective
proofs
and
understanding
of
the
experience
there
are
stages
one
leads
to
seeing
a
geometry
or
fractal
nature
of
reality
observing
this
stage
has
lead
to
understanding
the
reality
of
it
if
this
more
information
must
be
made
and
correlated
with
others
to
see
if
it
is
overall
a
standard
experience

i
hope
that
this
information
will
help
anyone
interested
in
new
levels
of
exploration
of
this
also
i
have
not
got
a
source
at
this
time
for
5me-dmt
and
this
may
work
as
well
i
hope
to
try
this
in
the
near
future


if
you
can
try
the
experiment
with
that
i
would
like
to
know
how
it
works
out
for
you



how
i
extract
the
dmt
i
use
mimosa
root
bark
powder
i
put
about
5
spoon
full
in
about
2
cups
of
water
in
a
glass
container
add
a
spoon
of
sodium
hydroxide
lye
stir
and
let
sit
for
a
day
or
so
add
a
cup
or
less
of
naphtha
i
use
lighter
fluid
and
works
great
stir
it
in
for
some
time
longer
is
better
let
sit
for
a
day
or
so
to
have
the
lighter
fluid
separate
get
this
off
the
top
i
used
a
eye
dropper
and
time
to
just
suck
it
off
the
top
i
use
glass
as
the
fluid
can
bother
plastics
i
put
the
fluid
into
a
glass
pan
then
let
it
sit
someplace
to
dry
off
the
fluid
i
used
a
fan
as
well
and
then
scrape
up
the
dmt
crystals
i
can
use
more
lighter
fluid
and
do
it
again
to
get
out
all
the
dmt
from
the
mimosa
a
few
times
but
this
is
the
basics
and
its
easiest




searching
for
elves
-
my
struggles
with
dmt


a
short
introduction

i
consider
myself
to
be
an
experienced
drug
user
i
have
tried
most
things
enjoying
some
substances
more
than
others
i
research
the
substance
im
using
and
take
all
precautions
necessary
to
facilitate
an
enjoyable
experience


achieving
a
breakthrough
status
with
dmt
had
become
something
of
a
personal
vendetta
over
the
course
of
approx
two
or
three
months
chiefly
because
of
the
amount
of
conflicting
information
online
with
regards
to
the
best
methods
of
actually
using
dmt

it
seems
that
everyone
is
an
expert
everyone
has
a
successful
trip
each
time
they
use
dmt
and
everyone
has
a
foolproof
method
of
smoking
dmt


i
spent
weeks
and
a
fair
amount
of
money
obtaining
dmt
and
buying/building
various
smoking
implements
and
devices
i
would
always
get
some
visuals

i
would
always
get
some
visuals

kaleidoscopic
patterns
on
the
inside
of
my
eyes
with
higher
doses
patterns
on
the
walls
presented
themselves
as-well
as
sort
of
clouds
of
patterns
falling
from
the
ceiling
these
transfixed
my
attention
for
a
time
but
i
wanted
more
i
wanted
the
out
of
body
experiences
that
so
many
people
describe
experiencing

on
a
regular
basis
ie
every
time
they
use
dmt

they
made
it
sound
so
easy



the
method
of
smoking
or
rather
vaporizing
dmt
freebase
had
always
been
my
achilles
heel
i
tried
meth
pipes
bulb
pipes
a
pipe
with
a
ceramic
layer
supposedly
purpose
made
for
vaping
i
also
spent
ages
messing
around
with
glass
bottles
of
various
sizes
in
an
attempt
to
build
the
machine
which
in
my
opinion
is
very
overrated
and
a
pain
in
the
arse
to
make

in
the
end
i
went
to
my
local
headshop
and
bought
a
£1200
standard
bong
the
chamber
is
about
30cm
long
medium
sized
bowl
and
a
rush
hole
i
bought
some
brillo
pads
these
are
steel
wool
pan
scrubbers
coated
with
soap
i
stuffed
as
much
of
the
brillo
into
the
bowl
as
a
could
to
see
how
much
i
needed
i
then
removed
the
brillo
with
tweezers
and
thoroughly
burned
the
steel
with
a
torch
lighter
i
did
this
until
the
brillo
had
lost
all
its
shine
and
gave
off
no
more
smoke
i
did
this
to
burn
away
all
the
soap


i
then
re-stuffed
the
brillo
back
in
the
bowl
very
tightly
i
gently
opened
the
centre
of
the
brillo
with
a
pen
and
placed
inside
approx
80mg
of
dmt
as
i
removed
the
pen
the
tightly
packed
brillo
closed
around
the
dmt
next
i
used
a
torch
lighter
on
the
glass
around
the
wool
i
could
still
see
the
dmt
inside
i
kept
my
eye
on
it
until
it
had
completely
melted
the
bowl
gave
off
a
whisp
of
vapor
and
i
knew
it
was
ready
to
be
used
i
then
waited
a
few
moments
for
the
glass
to
cool
the
bowl
is
just
a
standard
bowl
i
didnt
want
to
make
it
too
hot
in-case
it
cracked


next
i
used
a
standard
bic/flame
lighter
and
used
the
bong
as
if
there
were
herbs
in
there
it
took
maybe
3
seconds
to
fill
the
chamber
i
released
the
rush
hole
and
took
it
all
in
i
held
it
in
my
lungs
for
20
seconds
i
then
did
the
same
thing
again

this
is
where
things
became
interesting

i
could
already
feel
some
effects
and
i
could
hear
a
slight
rumbling
sound
for
the
third
and
final
pull
i
kept
my
finger
on
the
rush
hole
emptied
my
lungs
and
just
inhaled
until
they
were
fit
to
burst


i
held
my
breath
as
long
as
i
could
i
layed
down
put
the
bong
on
the
floor
and
realised
i
was
completely
wrecked
tracers
everywhere
patterns
directly
in-front
of
my
eyes
then
i
realised
i
hadnt
yet
exhaled
i
let
the
air
out
and
slumped
onto
my
bed
after
this
i
experienced
a
series
of
moments
that
defy
description
the
bed
felt
like
air
as
though
nothing
was
there
i
couldnt
feel
my
limbs
and
i
didnt
know
if
my
eyes
were
open
or
closed
this
terrified
me
i
thought
i
was
dying
i
thought
i
had
taken
too
much
and
that
i
was
going
to
die
the
last
conscious
thought
i
remember
was
scrambling
to
make
sure
my
jeans
were
done
up
i
didnt
want
anyone
to
find
my
dead
body
in
a
state
of
undress
even
though
i
was
fully
dressed
when
i
began
the
hands
that
were
fumbling
were
not
mine
they
were
yellow
and
seemed
cartoonish


at
this
point
my
fear
levels
increased
and
i
passed
out
i
remember
red
lines
moving
all
around
and
the
sensation
of
floating
but
after
that
nothing
after
about
15mins
i
woke
up
i
had
fallen
asleep
apparently
there
was
drool
down
my
face
and
on
my
pillow


i
felt
incredibly
frustrated


no
elves


no
otherworldly
experience


it
seems
as
though
i
had
wasted
an
opportunity
of
breaking
through
by
being
scared
then
i
fell
asleep
all
inside
the
space
of
15mins


the
conclusions
that
i
draw
from
this
experience
is
that
dmt
is
bloody
irritating

the
conclusions
that
i
draw
from
this
experience
is
that
dmt
is
bloody
irritating

i
now
believe
i
have
found
the
best
method
for
actually
using
dmt
my
next
challenge
is
to
try
not
to
lose
my
mind
while
i
actively
seek
to
lose
my
mind


the
saga
continues


one
thing
i
will
say
however
the
dmt
experience
isnt
to
be
taken
lightly
its
not
easy
to
use
and
its
not
a
casual
psychedelic
at
all
it
requires
effort
and
commitment
by
the
user
and
it
has
a
steep
learning
curve




200mg
dmt
in
butt
with
no
maoi

the
day
was
coming
to
an
end
around
the
usual
time
2am
i
bagged
up
02g
of
spice
and
made
my
way
back
to
my
home
where
the
experiment
was
to
be
conducted
i
had
tried
100mg
the
night
before
and
had
pretty
mild
effects
so
doubling
the
dose
seemed
appropriate

i
prepared
the
dmt
for
rectal
injection
like
this
poured
out
the
entire
bag
into
a
shotglass
and
slowly
added
white
vinegar
and
stirred
until
it
had
been
completely
saturated
with
dmt
with
none
left
floating
around
any
more
vinegar
than
what
is
necessary
can
cause
an
increased
warmness
sensation
in
the
bum
after
administration
sometimes
burning
slightly
i
did
not
dilute
it
with
water
this
time
because
i
was
sure
i
could
handle
the
burn
if
there
was
any
and
my
tool
was
a
measly
4ml
pipette

after
preparing
the
dose
i
set
the
pipette
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
selected
a
nice
playlist
stripped
down
shut
the
lights
off
and
administered
the
dose
ill
save
the
details
but
what
happened
was-
there
was
a
pinching
feeling
pushing
squeezing
and
pulling
now
is
when
i
pressed
play

6
or
7
minutes
into
the
shpongle
song
my
heart
started
beating
a
little
faster
i
was
breathing
a
little
harder
and
the
song
took
on
a
new
sort
of
ambiance
soon
after
that-
maybe
10
minutes
after
the
dose-
i
was
witnessing
infinitely
folding
yellow
figures
shifting
in
a
square
pattern
i
was
not
aware
of
anything
in
the
room
for
at
least
8
full
minutes
most
of
the
other
visuals
are
hard
to
remember

now
at
about
18
minutes
after
the
dose
i
become
slightly
aware
of
my
existence
on
earth
my
body
still
pretty
much
alien
to
me

now
at
about
18
minutes
after
the
dose
i
become
slightly
aware
of
my
existence
on
earth
my
body
still
pretty
much
alien
to
me

feeling
around
my
body
to
reassure
myself
of
my
physical
being
my
eyes
begin
to
water
much
harder
than
what
ive
experienced
on
smoked
doses
an
extraordinary
rush
of
euphoria
induced
smiling
laughing
and
crying
all
at
once
laying
in
my
bed
naked
and
confused
life
was
groovy

4
full
songs
after
the
dose
and
its
been
25
minutes
i
am
able
to
pull
my
blankets
over
me
and
myself
together
curl
up
press
pause
and
fall
asleep
the
experience
though
costly
was
definitely
one
of
my
favorites

and
i
will
definitely
be
trying
a
bit
more
next
time





im
pleased
to
report
that
our
local
chapter
of
the
last
saturdays
club
has
recently
stumbled
upon
a
real
breakthrough
advance
in
dmt
smoking
technology

sing
ho
for
the
joys
of
the
electronic
vaporizer

we
used
the
volcano
vaporization
system
by
storz
&
bickel
but
the
færie
is
not
their
sales
associate
and
i
bet
that
other
brands
work
just
as
well

we
simply
placed
the
proper
amount
of
material
on
a
piece
of
aluminum
foil
in
the
element

according
to
the
volcano
website
the
melting
and
boiling
points
of
aluminum
are
higher
than
the
machine
goes
so
we
dont
have
to
worry
about
inhaling
toxic
aluminum
foil
at
all

of
course
we
have
to
set
the
temperature
at
above
the
boiling
point
of
the
material
so
that
it
will
vaporize
we
used
an
analog
volcano
turned
up
to
8
almost
all
the
way
up
and
it
worked
all
fine
and
dandy
just
push
the
button
and
voila
the
bag
fills
up
with
magic
smoke

we
look
inside
the
machine
when
were
done
and
theres
nothing
left
but
foil



this
method
is
superior
in
several
important
respects

first
it
takes
the
guesswork
out
of
dosage

we
pretty
much
get
whatever
amount
we
put
into
the
machine
right
in
the
bag
which
can
easily
be
sucked
into
the
lungs
in
three
big
tokes


no
fuss
no
muss
no
red
hot
crack
pipe
to
deal
with

no
lighters
to
trickster
out
on
us
when
were
almost
there

you
can
do
it
by
yourself

you
can
do
it
lying
down

you
can
pass
the
bag
around
and
share
pop-ups

in
short
its
sheer
genius



we
tried
it
with
dmt
5-meo-dmt
and
with
a
combination
of
the
two

in
all
cases
it
worked
like
an
absolute
charm



oh
and
heres
the
kicker

do
you
know
that
sound

the
one
that
terence
mckenna
said
sounded
like
the
crumpling
of
a
plastic
bread
wrapper
or
the
crackling
of
flame

its
exactly
the
sound
of
the
vaporizer
bag
deflating
when
you
suck
on
it

i
guess
this
is
really
more
of
a
tech
report
than
an
experience
report
but
i
tell
you
i
laughed
my
ass
off
when
i
made
that
connection

i
thought
that
in
making
this
discovery
i
had
somehow
projected
that
sound
into
thousands
of
peoples
dmt
trips
even
ones
that
took
place
in
the
past


i
know
i
know

silly
færie


it
really
is
an
uncanny
synchronicity
though




this
is
not
so
much
a
trip
report
as
it
is
an
account
of
a
botched
preparation

i
noticed
no
one
has
posted
a
report
on
injected
dmt
salt
so
ill
provide
one


ive
extracted
dmt
several
times

ive
also
synthesized
it
but
i
find
that
route
is
more
trouble
than
it
is
worth
for
someone
working
with
otc
chemicals
basicly
i
got
shitty
yields
of
poor
purity
and
had
no
desire
to
flash
it
through
a
column

i
have
recently
improved
my
extraction
work-up
greatly
and
as
a
result
am
able
to
obtain
great
yields
of
damn
near
pure
product
clear
needles
recystallized
from
pet
ether

so
this
brings
me
to
my
story

ive
smoked
dmt
countless
times
and
have
had
great
experiences

after
reading
the
section
in
tihkal
i
decided
to
try
an
iv
injection

i
figure
you
use
half
the
product
and
get
twice
the
experience

in
tihkal
they
mentioned
some
study
long
ago
where
a
dmt
hcl
solution
was
used

as
hcl
is
the
acid
i
had
on
hand
suitable
for
use
to
make
a
salt
that
is
what
i
used

i
eyed
out
what
i
hoped
was
close
to
20
mg
i
only
wish
i
had
a
scale
that
would
measure
milligrams


[erowid
note
two
samples
of
powder
even
of
the
same
chemical
with
equivalent
volumes
wont
necessarily
weigh
the
same
for
this
reason
eyeballing
is
an
inaccurate
and
potentially
dangerous
method
of
measuring
particularly
for
substances
that
are
active
in
very
small
amountssee

this
article
on
the
importance
of
measured
doses
]




i
mixed
a
hcl/dh20
sol
to
about
ph
15

5
cc
was
pulled
into
an
insulin
syringe

the
dmt
freebase
was
placed
into
a
spoon
and
the
acidic
solution
was
squirted
on
to
it

much
to
my
dismay
the
crystals
did
not
dissolve

i
stirred
with
the
plunger
it
did
not
dissolve

i
tried
heating
which
merely
melted
to
crystals

it
smoked
a
little
smelling
strongly
of
dmt

i
was
starting
to
get
irritated
and
quickly
mixed
up
a
stronger
hcl
solution
pulled
2
cc
into
the
syringe
and
mixed
it
in
the
spoon

some
of
the
melted
crystals
actualled
dissolved
but
not
everything
went
into
solution


i
placed
a
cotton
into
the
spoon
and
sucked
up
the
solution
into
the
syringe

an
insulin
syringe
is
generally
1
cc
so
it
was
damn
near
full

i
tied
off
found
a
vein
and
began
to
slowly
inject
the
solution

in
about
10
seconds
my
heart
was
pounding
and
a
became
very
anxious

it
takes
forever
to
inject
that
much
solution
from
an
insulin
syringe
and
after
about
half
of
it
was
in
my
hand
started
shaking

the
needle
slipped
out
of
the
vein
i
started
to
notice
a
swelling
at
the
injection
site
at
which
time
i
removed
the
needle



the
effects
were
minimal
and
included
pupil
dilation
some
stimulant
like
effects
and
slight
visual
disturbances

there
was
also
pain
at
the
injection
site

the
dose
i
was
able
to
administer
was
only
threshold
level

i
would
not
try
this
again
with
the
hydrochloride
salt
it
is
just
to
much
of
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
obtain
a
solution

i
would
love
to
know
which
salt
shulgin
used

anyway
thats
my
story

i
dont
think
i
could
recommend
this




background



i
am
a
19-year
old
male
with
a
full-tuition
scholarship
to
an
sec
university
where
i
major
in
biology
and
spanish

i
am
a
pre-medicine
student
with
79
completed
hours
and
a
gpa
of
367

i
was
also
a
top-tier
student
in
high
school
i
scored
a
31
on
the
act
including
a
perfect
36
on
the
reading
section

i
had
stayed
away
from
drugs
in
high
school
except
drinking
on
rare
occasions

i
joined
a
fraternity
my
freshman
year
which
came
with
the
weekly
binge
drinking
associated
with
greek
life

i
began
to
smoke
weed
occasionally
which
is
practiced
less
in
fraternity
life
but
is
prevalent
in
almost
every
chapter
on
campus

by
spring
break
of
my
freshman
year
i
was
smoking
almost
every
day
with
my
fraternity
brothers

i
decided
i
was
going
to
try
psychedelics
when
summer
began

in
the
year
since
then
i
have
sampled
a
plethora
of
psychedelic
drugs
including
mushrooms
morning
glory
seeds
mescaline
ecstasy
lsd
and
dmt

i
smoked
dmt
twice
in
the
summer
of
2011

i
will
describe
in
detail
the
experience
i
had
the
second
time
i
smoked
dmt

experience



my
friend
kaz
told
me
he
had
acquired
enough
dmt
for
three
people
to
trip

so
the
next
day
we
drove
down
to
my
roommate
warrens
lake
house
to
smoke
it

kaz
split
the
yellow-orange
crystals
into
three
piles
about
the
size
of
a
nickel

kaz
and
warren
had
their
own
bowls
to
smoke
the
dmt
i
did
not
have
my
own
piece
so
i
decided
i
would
smoke
out
of
an
old
bong
that
kaz
had
brought
along

kaz
packed
up
all
three
pieces
with
dmt
under
a
layer
of
kush
and
we
went
outside
to
trip

warren
suggested
that
we
go
out
on
the
lake
in
his
canoe
to
smoke
the
dmt

i
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
but
kaz
said
it
was
too
dangerous

we
decided
we
would
smoke
under
warrens
deck
this
decision
probably
saved
all
three
of
our
lives

we
sat
in
lawn
chairs
with
our
pieces
ready
to
go
and
played
some
pretty
lights
on
warrens
phone
to
trip
to

i
had
smoked
dmt
once
before
but
i
had
not
\x93broken
through
so
i
decided
i
was
going
to
take
as
big
of
a
hit
as
i
could
this
time



i
put
the
flame
on
the
bowl
and
drew
in
slowly
to
avoid
torching
the
dmt
for
as
long
as
i
could

i
exhaled
and
took
a
quick
glance
at
the
bong
filled
with
thick
dmt
smoke

i
inhaled
sharply
and
sucked
every
last
bit
of
the
smoke
deep
into
my
lungs

i
held
the
smoke
in
for
about
7
seconds
before
exhaling
and
i
was
already
tripping
harder
than
i
ever
had
before

everything
in
my
vision
became
so
vibrant
that
it
surpassed
my
understanding
of
what
a
color
is

i
tried
to
remember
but
it
was
already
too
distant
a
memory
to
recall
in
my
current
state
of
mind



i
think
i
closed
my
eyes
but
i
will
never
be
sure

i
felt
a
voice
say
\x93come
with
me
and
i
went


i
instantly
lost
connection
with
everything
i
had
ever
experienced
since
my
birth

i
could
not
even
think
in
my
own
language
or
remember
anything
at
all
about
my
past

i
broke
into
a
state
of
consciousness
without
the
perceptive
lens
of
being
myself
or
a
human
or
even
a
living
organism

i
not
only
felt
dissociated
from
my
body
i
was
separated
from
my
soul

i
experienced
an
eternity
in
an
instant

i
had
blasted
into
oblivion
free
of
any
shred
of
conscious
thought

i
think
i
was
in
ego-death
for
about
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
of
human
time



coming
back
to
the
concept
of
having
a
body
i
thought
i
was
lying
dead
in
the
street
in
the
presence
of
my
mother
and
an
ambulance
crew

then
kaz
said
\x93guys
we
just
blasted
the
fuck
off

i
remembered
that
i
had
smoked
dmt
and
came
most
of
the
way
back
to
reality

the
rest
of
the
five
or
ten
minutes
of
the
experience
was
just
normal
visuals
and
feelings
that
come
from
an
average
dose
of
lsd

reflection



the
extreme
intensity
of
this
trip
definitely
came
from
the
method
of
ingestion

smoking
the
dmt
out
of
the
bong
allowed
me
take
a
much
bigger
hit
deeper
into
my
lungs
and
hold
the
smoke
in
longer
than
is
possible
with
a
bowl

dmt
tastes
absolutely
terrible
but
i
was
tripping
too
hard
before
my
first
breath
after
the
hit
to
comprehend
taste

the
total
loss
of
connection
with
my
ego
shattered
everything
i
had
previously
believed
about
the
relationship
of
the
human
body
and
the
soul

i
had
been
a
christian
and
fully
believed
that
my
soul
in
the
sense
of
my
personality
and
memories
would
pass
into
the
after-life



upon
returning
from
ego-death
i
immediately
dropped
the
idea
that
the
soul
remains
intact
after
the
death
of
the
body

i
now
believe
that
what
people
think
of
as
their
soul
is
actually
only
their
perceived
separation
of
their
consciousness
from
their
body

i
now
think
of
everything
much
more
objectively
rather
than
from
the
limited
perspective
of
a
human

i
used
to
think
of
god
as
being
very
close
to
the
deity
described
in
the
bible
now
i
believe
that
god
is
the
everlasting
and
unwavering
laws
of
the
universe
such
as
gravity
and
intermolecular
forces



this
dmt
trip
was
much
more
intense
than
what
i
was
prepared
for
or
even
thought
was
possible
from
psychedelic
drugs

since
this
experience
i
have
had
a
few
serious
after-effects
that
i
believe
result
directly
from
tripping
so
hard
on
dmt

multiple
times
when
i
have
gotten
strong
head-rushes
i
feel
extremely
spaced
out
similar
to
the
feeling
of
the
onset
of
dmt
and
i
even
taste
dmt
in
my
mouth

if
i
let
my
head
hang
back
over
the
edge
of
a
chair
my
vision
goes
black
and
then
immediately
returns
accompanied
by
intense
hallucinations
one
time
i
was
hanging
on
a
ladder
at
the
top
of
a
staircase
at
my
frat
house
to
loosen
my
back
and
went
into
a
crazy
trance

the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
of
six
stairs
looking
up
at
warren
standing
at
the
top

the
alarming
thing
was
that
i
had
not
just
passed
out
and
fallen
down
the
steps

my
eyes
had
been
open
and
i
had
actually
watched
as
i
fell
all
the
way
down
the
steps
i
just
had
been
tripping
too
hard
to
realize
i
was
in
a
dangerous
situation



i
do
not
recommend
that
anyone
use
dmt
or
other
extreme
doses
of
psychedelics
unless
they
are
prepared
for
the
possible
intense
mental
consequences
that
are
an
inherent
risk
of
psychedelic
drug
use

although
i
consider
my
dmt
trip
to
be
the
most
important
experience
of
my
life
i
would
never
even
consider
doing
it
again




the
following
is
a
personal
account
of
my
ultimate
trip
in
deep
psychedelic
inner-space
over
the
past
13
years
or
so
ive
been
always
looking
to
reach
the
next
level
im
talking
about
drugs
of
course
ive
tried
almost
every
mind
altering
substance
known
to
man
but
nothing
came
close
to
the
insane
experience
i
had
on
dmt
a
couple
hours
ago

i
tried
dmt
for
the
first
time
in
2003
in
isla
vista
ca
small
beach
city
close
to
santa
barbara
it
was
in
the
wee
hours
of
the
morning
after
a
night
of
heavy
drinking
and
rackn
lines
of
coke
i
was
chilling
with
my
boys
at
this
dudes
crib
blazing
chron
and
pounding
fodeez
when
the
random
guy
on
the
couch
woke
up
from
his
faded
stupor
and
packed
me
a
bowl
of
some
herb
and
this
yellowish
powder
dmt
he
said
its
the
craziest
shit
hes
ever
tried
in
my
circles
im
not
really
know
as
the
guy
who
would
back
down
and
be
a
pussy
and
say
no
so
i
said
what
tha
fuck
lets
do
it
i
lit
the
shit
inhaled
and
then
it
hit
me

i
was
immediately
transported
into
another
fucking
dimension
it
was
like
the
space
trip
in
2001
a
space
odyssey
i
was
being
launched
to
space
and
traveling
through
this
vortex
black
hole
tube
thing
at
an
extreme
velocity
i
was
seeing
lasers
graphs
geometric
shapes
and
other
images
i
felt
a
foreign
being
take
a
hold
of
me
it
was
alien-like
almost
evil
it
started
to
communicate
with
me
it
told
me
that
they
put
that
bark
on
earth
for
mankind
to
find
it
and
smoke
it
to
communicate
with
them
it
was
our
way
to
find
out
the
secret
the
meaning
of
life
that
being
made
me
realize
that
we
are
just
puppets
in
a
grand
play
they
are
light-years
ahead
of
us
and
much
more
intelligent
the
alien
said
that
earth
was
their
planet
and
they
allowed
us
to
live
there
that
shit
just
blew
my
mind
i
could
not
believe
what
i
was
experiencing


ive
tripped
out
on
a
bunch
of
shit
like
mad
liquid
acid
shrooms
special
k
mescaline
e
meth
and
other
crazy
euro
shit
during
my
extended
stay
in
budapest
hungary
for
example
the
hocky-puck
it
looks
like
a
round
thin
black
screen
and
you
put
on
your
tongue
like
a
tab
its
made
of
mushroom
oil
extract
and
mescaline
i
have
to
say
its
one
of
the
craziest
and
most
demented
things
ive
done
it
was
the
most
powerful
thing
ive
done
at
that
point
and
even
that
did
not
even
faze
my
latest
dmt
trip
i
used
to
go
raves
every
weekend
for
a
number
of
years
doing
shit
i
was
always
that
kid
who
took
too
much
ive
been
to
the
far
reaches
of
the
galaxy
but
this
shit
put
me
through
to
the
other
side

the
second
time
i
smoked
dmt
was
yesterday
at
my
pad
in
hollywood
my
buddy
and
i
made
our
own
shit
this
time
i
ordered
that
shit
online
from
one
of
those
ethnobotanical
websites
its
scientific
name
is
mimosa
hostilis
its
root
bark
that
comes
from
south
america
we
did
our
research
on
all
the
teks
we
could
find
at
the
time
and
we
decided
on
the
lazy-mans
one
it
was
fairly
easy
to
make
but
a
tad
bit
tedious
i
knew
what
i
was
in
for
so
i
remained
patient
and
optimistic
although
at
one
point
i
had
some
serious
doubts
about
our
skills
in
the
preparation
of
psychoactive
substances
not
to
mention
following
directions


my
buddy
well
call
him
paranoid
alien
or
pa
for
simplicitys
sake
hes
a
seasoned
veteran
tripper
but
hes
never
tried
dmt
before
he
was
eagerly
waiting
to
try
our
creation
a
couple
days
after
extraction
i
tried
smoking
it
in
a
ghetto
homemade
crack
pipe
made
from
a
broken
glass
bowl
and
some
foil

i
didnt
feel
shit
it
evaporated
really
quickly
afterwards
i
tried
to
freebase
it
off
of
foil
that
didnt
work
as
well
i
had
the
same
problem
it
evaporated
to
fast

i
started
to
worry
that
we
fucked
up

so
i
thought
if
i
snort
it
theres
no
way
it
can
evaporate
and
im
bound
to
feel
something
i
made
myself
a
phat
strap
and
racked
it
to
the
head
the
shit
burned
sooooo
bad
it
felt
like
somebody
poured
habanero
hot
sauce
up
my
nostrils
after
about
10
minutes
i
started
to
feel
it
creeping
on
it
wasnt
strong
by
any
means
but
rather
gentle
and
tamed
i
had
really
minor
trails
and
visuals
and
a
slight
body
high
it
was
kind
of
euphoric
like
coke
but
with
weak
visuals
it
was
nothing
too
crazy
but
at
least
i
knew
it
worked
i
went
to
bed
thinking
maybe
i
should
smoke
it
out
of
a
bong
with
some
weed
like
the
first
time
i
tried
it

next
evening
i
grabbed
my
faded
2ft
3
chamber
double
bub
color
changing
glass
bong
now
this
piece
is
the
mother
of
all
bongs
it
has
3
chambers
and
an
ice
catcher
so
the
smoke
filters
through
2
sets
of
water
and
some
ice
cubes
so
i
get
the
smoothest
hit
possible
dmt
can
be
harsh
at
times
i
turned
down
the
lights
lit
some
candles
and
popped
in
this
moonshine
trippy
visuals
dvd
to
watch
it
on
my
52in
sharp
aquos
lcd
with
a
pioneer
4
tower
speaker
51
surround
sound
system
i
put
a
layer
of
bud
on
top
of
the
screen
in
the
bowl
then
took
the
corner
of
a
business
card
and
dipped
it
in
a
pile
of
dmt
crystals
i
sprinkled
it
on
top
and
then
covered
it
with
some
more
bud
to
not
light
the
crystals
directly


shit
hit
me
as
soon
as
i
cleared
the
bong
the
initial
rush
was
insane
the
walls
were
not
only
breathing
like
on
acid
or
shrooms
but
everything
in
the
room
was
so
colorful
and
vivid
that
it
seemed
like
i
was
in
a
cartoon
all
the
objects
in
the
room
were
outlined
in
dramatic
colors
i
have
2
picture
of
new
york
above
my
tv
which
came
alive
and
crawled
up
my
ceiling
the
candles
made
it
look
like
the
city
was
on
fire
the
popcorn
ceiling
was
like
a
huge
microchip
outlined
like
a
colorful
graph
i
felt
like
i
was
in
the
matrix
then
i
closed
my
eyes
to
see
what
it
would
look
like
on
the
inside
i
reacted
to
the
brightness
of
the
tv
and
the
candles
as
well
as
the
different
colors
they
created
i
didnt
see
any
aliens
this
time
but
i
felt
that
alien
presence
and
it
was
pretty
crazy
to
say
the
least

it
was
jaw
dropping
incredible
i
was
just
sitting
there
in
awe
gawking
at
every
trippy
object
in
the
room

a
few
minutes
later
i
tried
the
same
method
but
with
a
regular
weed
pipe
i
felt
it
a
little
bit
but
it
was
really
ineffective
compared
to
hittin
the
bong
that
same
evening
pa
tried
to
smoke
some
using
the
same
method
out
of
his
small
weed
pipe
he
had
at
home
it
didnt
really
work
for
him
and
he
gave
up
after
2
attempts
and
went
to
bed
i
hit
the
sack
as
well
and
we
both
agreed
that
well
give
this
a
proper
go
tomorrow


the
next
evening
took
place
the
most
insane
trip
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
lets
keep
in
mind
folks
that
im
a
seasoned
veteran
and
i
always
like
to
push
the
envelope
to
see
how
far
i
can
go
i
gave
pa
a
little
bit
less
than
what
i
had
the
night
before
we
popped
in
2001
a
space
odyssey
and
pc
cranked
up
some
floyd
on
his
ipod
it
was
the
crazy
scene
where
dave
goes
into
this
colorful
hyperspace
bliss
hovering
over
planets
we
also
lit
candles
turned
on
some
black
lights
and
placed
some
trippy
flashing
blue
lights
in
the
room
i
also
happened
to
have
this
colorful
disco
light
ball
called
the
cyclotron
that
reflects
colorful
images
around
the
room

pa
took
a
phat
rip
closed
his
eyes
laid
back
and
was
speechless
for
the
next
few
minutes
i
felt
like
i
had
to
join
him
on
his
magical
journey
so
i
packed
myself
a
bowl
too
like
an
idiot
i
tripled
the
dosage
i
had
the
night
before
and
i
mixed
it
with
this
danky
kush
i
got
earlier
i
never
imagined
i
could
ever
experience
that
psychonautic
level
it
just
hit
me
like
a
ton
of
bricks
it
took
control
almost
immediately
i
sensed
the
higher
power
of
greater
beings
or
aliens
through
an
advanced
telepathic
communication
with
them
i
perceived
that
i
was
going
to
be
shown
something
and
taken
for
a
wild
ride
there
was
no
fighting
this
thing
there
was
no
way
to
break
free
just
like
johnny
depp
said
in
fear
and
loathing
and
i
told
myself
on
my
previous
trips
\x93go
with
it
dont
fight
it
it
will
only
get
worse
if
you
fight
it
i
told
myself
the
same
thing
now
but
there
was
only
one
problem
i
couldnt
fight
it
or
go
with
it


i
was
in
the
void
the
room
exploded
with
color
i
was
blasted
to
another
dimension
again
only
this
time
i
was
convinced
it
was
a
one
way
trip
i
catapulted
through
space
with
great
speed
traveling
over
scary
alien
worlds
knowing
that
theres
no
turning
back
with
every
passing
second
i
felt
like
i
was
going
deeper
in
this
fantastic
world
my
body
was
nowhere
at
that
point
i
lost
complete
feel
for
my
body
like
a
k-hole
hundred
times
worse
than
any
ive
been
in
it
was
a
total
out
of
body
more
like
out
of
mind
experience
as
i
was
going
deeper
i
tried
to
fight
it
to
regain
some
kind
of
control
it
was
useless


the
room
was
just
incredible
sensory
fucking
overload
on
all
levels
my
neurotransmitters
were
burning
pulsating
and
screaming

cyclotron
made
it
seem
like
i
was
in
a
spaceship
with
spinning
lights
then
the
candles
had
this
burning
effect
on
my
spaceship
i
was
on
fire
and
i
was
going
to
crash
there
was
way
too
much
stimuli
to
digest
then
it
felt
like
something
cracked
in
my
head
like
i
burst
a
blood
vessel
or
something
i
could
not
handle
the
madness
that
surrounded
me
and
i
reached
the
breaking
point
i
somehow
had
this
feeling
that
if
i
give
up
now
and
crash
then
my
body
will
die
in
the
real
world
it
was
no
use
it
had
a
hold
on
me
like
nothing
ive
experienced
and
we
were
going
down

my
life
flashed
before
me
during
this
part
of
the
trip
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
die
it
happened
so
fast
that
i
thought
to
myself
\x93ok
z
this
time
you
really
done
it
youve
been
pushing
your
luck
for
so
many
years
thinking
you
can
take
anything
without
consequence
and
now
this
shit
is
going
to
do
you
in
it
wasnt
only
that
but
it
felt
like
i
was
being
punished
for
undermining
this
powerful
drug
it
was
like
fuck
you
bitch
you
cant
hang
wit
this
shit
who
do
you
think
you
are
you
think
youre
hot
shit
well
try
this
on
for
size
motherfucka
blam
in
yo
face

i
crash
landed
and
thats
when
shit
went
white
im
on
the
other
side
now
pa
said
that
my
body
was
convulsing
and
my
heart
felt
like
it
was
about
to
explode
then
i
laid
still
at
this
point
im
completely
retarded
i
cannot
function
shit
i
start
floating
up
and
see
myself
from
above
looking
down
on
my
body
and
pa
trying
to
revive
me
my
girlfriend
sugar-butt
runs
in
the
room
screaming
theyre
both
above
me
now
stroking
my
face
and
telling
me
that
everythings
going
to
be
ok
and
that
they
will
get
me
some
help

then
everything
started
moving
fast
again
fast
forwarding
on
the
events
after
my
death
the
ambulance
came
out
and
took
me
to
the
hospital
i
was
in
a
laboratory
lying
on
a
table
waiting
to
be
sliced
open
and
experimented
on
pa
and
i
were
all
over
the
news
he
made
it
out
safely
but
i
took
too
much
and
fried
my
brain
our
story
became
a
really
hot
affair
we
were
made
examples
of
for
kids
to
not
do
drugs
or
this
is
what
will
happen
it
felt
like
the
damn
truman
show
like
an
evil
game
show
my
whole
life
was
being
filmed
for
the
rest
of
the
worlds
entertainment
from
me
as
a
small
fetus
to
my
last
hit
of
a
lethal
dmt
weed
mix
it
was
pure
torture
because
there
was
no
way
out
i
felt
like
i
was
stuck
in
an
eternal
prison
in
my
delusional
nihilistic
mind
i
was
an
observer
whishing
i
can
regain
control
of
my
body
i
was
now
solidly
plugged
into
this
tremendous
channel
of
never-ending
information

my
family
and
friends
were
all
crying
at
first
but
later
laughing
saying
\x93you
got
what
you
wanted
i
saw
my
funeral
go
down
as
i
was
lowered
in
the
grave
i
looked
upward
at
everybody
staring
down
at
me
it
felt
like
i
was
swirling
down
the
drain
at
this
point
in
the
abyss
i
remembered
reading
about
how
the
human
brain
releases
dmt
before
you
die
i
thought
that
this
had
to
be
it
this
has
to
be
the
final
moment
of
my
puny
meaningless
existence
i
felt
pathetic
i
couldnt
believe
that
this
is
how
im
going
out
fuck
dat
shit
everything
turned
black

i
believe
that
this
is
where
i
flatelined
i
hear
pas
voice
very
faintly
i
start
seeing
some
traces
of
color
and
hear
some
ambient
noise
is
this
hope
did
i
found
a
way
out
i
was
thinking
if
there
is
hope
for
survival
i
would
be
a
comatose
vegetable
in
a
nuthouse
somewhere
there
was
no
way
i
would
come
back
normal
i
had
to
try
though
i
tried
really
hard
to
open
my
eyes
but
i
couldnt
the
colors
started
getting
brighter
and
more
intense
and
the
noise
more
apparent
felt
like
i
was
rising
upward
to
go
back
to
where
i
came
from


i
see
shapes
starting
to
form
around
me
all
of
the
sudden
i
was
back
in
the
spaceship
traveling
through
an
insane
colorful
vortex
i
was
submersed
in
synaesthetic
sea
of
visuals
moving
up
the
spiral
at
high
speeds
alien
beings
were
attacking
my
spaceship
and
trying
to
prevent
my
escape
they
were
trying
to
get
me
to
my
surprise
pa
is
in
the
spaceship
with
me
shooting
aliens
and
clearing
the
way
for
us
fuck
yea
like
all
great
intergalactic
tag-teams
captain
james
t
kirk
and
mr
spock
han
solo
and
chewbacca
space
ghost
and
zorak
we
were
battling
the
forces
of
evil
on
the
new
frontier
not
to
conquer
but
for
self-preservation
i
saw
a
school
of
yellow
tail
swimming
around
and
for
some
reason
i
had
to
go
fish
so
i
threw
my
line
and
started
to
fish
for
yellow
tail
during
my
high
speed
chase
through
the
alien
infested
vortex
that
was
going
to
bring
me
salvation
hmmmmmreal
smart

the
light
i
saw
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
it
started
getting
brighter
as
we
blasted
up
i
knew
that
this
has
to
be
the
way
to
get
back
to
the
other
side
it
just
dawned
on
me
that
i
actually
broke
on
through
to
the
other
side
like
jim
fuckin
morrison
and
now
im
heading
back
to
my
world
we
got
out
just
in
time
i
felt
like
another
second
in
that
psychedelic
hell
and
i
would
have
been
toast

i
was
able
to
see
clearly
now
and
realized
what
just
happened
pa
was
about
to
call
the
cops
because
he
thought
i
might
not
survive
this

my
visuals
were
still
off
the
charts
insane
but
i
had
a
sense
that
im
back
now
and
all
i
have
to
do
is
sit
through
this
and
ill
be
fine
i
reassured
pa
that
im
cool
now
and
he
doesnt
have
to
call
an
ambulance
i
was
still
hardcore
tripping
at
this
point
it
felt
like
the
teeth-grinding
dragon
breathing
down
my
neck
frenzied
peak
of
an
intense
liquid
acid
trip
it
was
starting
to
leave
me
now
wooooohooooo
demon
be
gone

the
sheer
joy
of
being
alive
was
overwhelming
for
the
next
half
an
hour
i
could
not
stop
talking
about
my
experience
i
could
not
believe
how
far
i
went
that
trip
was
the
craziest
shit
ive
ever
heard
of
or
experienced
personally
im
also
convinced
that
at
one
point
i
died
and
came
back
ill
never
go
beyond
that
point
too
bad
i
dont
have
a
scale
so
i
can
measure
the
amount
i
took
but
any
more
and
i
would
have
been
perma-fried
or
wait
am
imuhahahhaahahmuhahahahahjust
kidding

this
was
an
earth-shattering
psychedelic
experience
that
made
me
realize
how
important
my
sanity
is
i
would
rather
die
than
experience
life
looking
through
a
distorted
window
of
reality
where
i
cannot
engage
my
environment
i
think
i
got
an
insight
to
what
a
catatonic
patient
on
a
permanent
bad
trip
must
feel




i
have
decided
to
write
a
trip
report
for
reasons
that
are
twofold

for
one
i
do
wish
to
warn
others
of
some
of
the
complications
i
experienced
on
this
drug

i
have
read
many
trip
reports
and
done
a
lot
of
research
plus
have
personally
experimented
with
it
in
the
past
and
i
believe
what
happened
to
me
is
less
common

i
believe
what
happened
to
me
is
less
common


second
part
of
my
reason
for
writing
this
is
selfish

i
desperately
need
a
way
to
help
integrate
this
experience
to
move
forward
with
my
life
and
i
this
is
an
attempt
at
doing
just
that

background

i
am
a
33
y/o
female
who
is
quite
experienced
with
psychedelics

i
really
enjoy
marijuana
lsd
mushrooms
ketamine
mdma
2cb
combinations
of
the
aforementioned
substances
etc

prior
to
the
experience
i
am
about
to
share
i
had
smoked
dmt
approximately
15-20
times
but
usually
out
of
a
vape
pen
which
cuts
me
off
before
i
can
really
get
a
blast
off
dose
if
you
will

some
of
those
trips
were
really
cool
and
some
were
scary
but
never
so
frightening
it
turned
me
away
from
my
pursuit
of
crystal
dmt
i
spent
years
looking
for
it
and
3
weeks
ago
i
finally
found
it

my
husband
and
i
bought
a
gram
and
partook
in
a
few
small
trips
working
up
the
courage
to
take
that
blast
off
dose

the
set
up

4
days
ago
at
aprox
1500
we
decided
it
was
time
to
try
to
travel
to
another
dimension
and
meet
these
entities
we
keep
hearing
about

i
invited
2
of
our
friends
over
k
and
p

we
used
our
rig
to
dab
the
dmt
p
went
first
and
blew
her
40
mg
hit
out
immediately
through
her
nose

accordingly
she
had
a
fun
experience
in
which
she
was
still
able
to
communicate
with
us

k
went
next
and
did
a
smaller
dose
and
came
back
10
minutes
later
sharing
about
all
the
amazing
visuals
she
had
seen
and
love
she
had
felt


my
husband
decided
to
go
last
so
finally
the
moment
i
had
waited
for
it
was
my
turn

my
husband
got
the
rig
ready
and
poured
in
40
mg
of
dimitri

i
inhaled
it
all
and
laid
back
on
the
couch

some
gramatik
song
was
playing
i
cannot
remember
which
as
i
held
in
the
smoke
i
closed
my
eyes
and
began
to
see
hazy
dull
colors
and
patterns

i
thought
to
myself
this
isn\t
really
working
and
let
the
smoke
out

i
started
to
say
to
my
husband
i
needed
more
hah
yeah
right
but
i
couldn\t
get
it
out

what
happened
next
is
a
it
of
a
blur
but
this
is
my
best
recollection

the
trip
all
of
a
sudden
bright
neon
elaborate
patterns
spirals
and
jester-like
clown
people
filled
my
vision
i
was
already
terrified
and
could
not
understand
what
was
going
on

it
is
difficult
to
find
words
in
the
english
language
to
describe
a
true
dmt
trip
but
this
is
the
only
way
i
can
think
to
describe
it

it
felt
like
one
of
the
jester
creatures
grabbed
me
from
behind
and
then
grabbed
my
upper
lip
stretching
and
pulling
it
over
my
head
turning
my
face
inside
out

i
found
it
difficult
to
breath

at
this
point
i
was
still
laying
down
with
my
eyes
closed
he
the
jester
felt
like
a
male
to
me
for
some
reason
then
slammed
me
face
first
into
the
couch
and
then
pulled
me
back
up
and
tore
both
my
eye
lids
open
forcing
me
to
take
in
the
insane
psychedelia
before
me

my
husband
and
friends
said
at
one
point
i
bolted
up
to
a
sitting
position
with
my
eyes
wide
open
darting
rapidly
around
the
room

i
think
this
coincides
with
the
feeling
of
having
my
eyes
torn
open
and
being
forced
to
watch
this
horror
unfold


the
words
i
was
hearing
in
my
head
were
you
think
you
can
play
with
us
you
little
b****

i
couldn\t
understand
what
was
going
on
or
what
i
had
done
to
get
treated
like
this

i
don\t
even
think
i
knew
who
i
was
but
i
definitely
knew
something
was
horribly
wrong


the
next
thing
i
remember
is
feeling
like
this
jester
had
stuck
jagged
plastic
down
my
throat
and
i
was
choking
to
death

outwardly
my
husband
and
friends
said
i
had
started
gagging
and
this
is
when
they
became
concerned

looking
back
i
am
sure
the
taste
of
plastic
and
the
harshness
of
the
smoke
is
what
led
to
this
feeling
but
when
you
are
that
high
you
have
zero
ability
to
rationalize
this

the
gagging
turned
into
me
spitting
all
over
the
couch
and
my
husband
said
it
looked
like
i
was
about
to
throw
up

instead
of
throwing
up
i
tried
to
stand
up
according
to
my
loved
ones
who
got
me
to
sit
back
down
and
began
crying
out
help
help
help
help
over
and
over

the
jester
continued
to
choke
me
and
i
felt
like
i
was
loosing
the
battle

i
started
saying
i
can\t
breathe
i
can\t
breathe


finally
the
trip
began
to
release
its
grip
and
i
could
hear
voices
that
were
familiar
but
the
most
familiar
voice
i
could
finally
hear
was
my
own

i
heard
myself
begging
for
help
and
asking
how
to
breathe

i
heard
myself
begging
for
help
and
asking
how
to
breathe

my
husband
said
i
even
said
help
me
you
guys
and
he
said
that
notified
him
that
i
was
coming
back
because
i
had
some
concept
that
my
loved
ones
were
there

i
slowly
came
out
of
it
and
as
i
was
coming
back
that
jester
character
was
surrounded
by
beautiful
colors
and
patterns
and
he
was
kind
of
dancing
and
smiling
and
laughing
saying
come
again
little
girl

we\ll
be
waiting
and
other
eerie
stuff
like
that
when
i
finally
completely
came
to
i
saw
3
very
scared
people
surrounding
me
rubbing
my
back
telling
me
i
was
ok
and
i
was
safe

i
had
no
idea
why
they
were
telling
me
this
and
i
turned
to
my
husband
and
said
what\s
going
on
what\s
happening
to
me

he
replied
babe
you
did
dmt

i
began
to
cry

the
whole
experience
was
only
about
5
minutes
possibly
less
which
is
short
even
for
dmt
i
was
later
told

it
felt
like
a
life
time

the
aftermath
it
is
4
days
later

the
trip
is
very
difficult
to
remember
visually
but
the
feelings
are
not

i
can
still
feel
that
jagged
plastic
in
my
throat
im
assuming
i
must
have
burned
it
or
something

i
still
feel
sick
to
my
stomach

i
still
feel
anxiety
and
fear

i
had
to
leave
work
early
the
other
day
and
begged
my
husband
to
leave
work
too
because
i
was
anxious
and
scared
and
felt
like
the
only
safe
place
for
me
in
this
world
was
with
him

i
sincerely
feel
traumatized

the
main
entity
i
saw
was
mean
he
was
maniacal
taunting
violent
and
aggressive

i
feel
like
i
am
on
the
verge
of
a
panic
attack
writing
this
out

my
takeaways
when
i
started
this
i
said
i
wanted
to
warn
others

and
i
dont
mean
about
the
intense
hallucinations
or
entities

i
have
heard
of
horrible
trips
and
i
did
know
it
was
possible
even
likely

i
guess
i
didnt
realize
it
could
ever
be
that
aggressive
of
a
hallucination
but
hey
its
dmt
anything
can
happen
when
you
enter
that
realm

i
was
in
that
entitys
world
and
it
had
its
way
with
me



what
i
really
want
people
to
be
mindful
of
is
that
dmt
can
be
physically
dangerous


you
always
hear
i
always
heard
things
like
youe
so
high
you
can\t
keep
your
eyes
open
and
you
can\t
move
you
just
lay
there

well
news
flash
i
did
both
and
i
could
have
hurt
myself
trying
to
stand
up
like
that
if
my
friends
and
husband
had
not
been
there

i
could
have
hurt
myself
trying
to
stand
up
like
that
if
my
friends
and
husband
had
not
been
there

i
didnt
read
about
people
almost
choking
or
throwing
up
on
it
until
i
started
to
research
it
after
my
experience
and
even
then
there
is
not
a
lot
of
information
on
this
side
effect

perhaps
because
it
doesnt
happen
often
but
it
can
happen



if
you
are
going
to
do
this
drug
i
would
have
a
sitter

someone
who
can
help
you
get
sit
back
down
or
throw
up
safely



i
wont
ever
touch
this
substance
again
and
i
probably
wont
consume
any
form
of
psychedelic
until
i
am
able
to
integrate
this
experience




i
had
carefully
experimented
with
many
drugs
including
marijuana
lsd
mushrooms
cactus
mdma
ketamine
morning
glory
seeds
and
several
others
i
had
gone
far
with
some
of
these
substances
and
always
found
my
way
back
with
insight
and
experience
gained
i
had
read
the
book
the
spirit
molecule
about
dmt
as
well
as
listened
to
many
of
terence
mckennas
lectures
and
read
some
of
his
writings

my
friend
r
acquired
enough
dmt
for
substantial
experimentation
my
friends
and
i
were
all
psychonauts
and
always
researched
and
proceeded
with
caution
before
experimenting
with
new
substances
after
much
reading
on
the
subject
we
decided
that
dmt
was
nothing
to
play
around
and
that
we
should
begin
very
carefully
with
very
light
doses

i
smoked
light
doses
of
dmt
on
about
4
separate
occasions
taking
a
cautious
small
puff
from
a
pipe
each
time
was
profound
and
unnerving
as
if
i
was
glimpsing
something
i
wasnt
supposed
to
see
on
one
occasion
i
got
an
impression
of
golden
shimmering
heiroglyphics
on
another
i
seemed
to
feel
that
i
was
in
an
operating
room
surrounded
by
doctors
it
took
me
days
after
each
of
these
light
experiences
to
work
up
the
courage
to
try
it
again

one
night
we
were
passing
the
bowl
with
dmt-infused
damiana
my
friends
r
and
k
were
each
starting
slow
taking
light
puffs
when
it
was
my
turn
on
a
whim
i
decided
to
go
all
out
with
a
breathing
technique
i
call
the
zen
bong
technique
i
took
an
impossibly
large
hit
slowly
burning
almost
the
entire
bowl
breathing
the
thick
chemical-tasting
smoke
in
deeply
my
friends
exchanged
looks
of
surprise
then
looked
at
me
with
raised
eyebrows
curious
what
would
happen
i
was
about
to
go
further
than
any
of
us
had
i
sortve
shrugged
at
them
as
if
to
say
eh
you
know
might
as
well
i
thought
i
was
ready
to
see
what
this
drug
was
all
about
yeah
sure

about
this
time
i
felt
the
beginning
of
the
wave
i
realized
oh
shit
this
is
about
to
get
serious
i
exhaled
and
leaned
forward
to
hand
the
pipe
to
r
knowing
that
i
had
seconds
before
i
was
in
deep
as
i
leaned
forward
the
chair
i
was
sitting
in
snapped
and
broke
and
i
stumbled
forward
onto
the
concrete

r
started
yelling
at
me
about
breaking
his
chair
just
as
i
launched
into
hyperspace
this
i
believe
contributed
to
the
effects
which
followed
in
addition
to
the
state
of
my
life
in
general
either
way
it
hit
me
-
or
i
hit
it
it
was
a
giant
fractal
stained
glass
window
deep
emerald
green
i
shot
out
through
my
third
eye
blasting
through
the
emerald
veil
like
a
bullet
my
body
slumped
onto
the
concrete
spread-eagle
but
i
was
in
a
different
universe

what
happened
next
was
stunning
my
life
flashed
before
my
eyes
but
it
wasnt
how
i
thought
it
would
be
it
was
in
the
form
of
photographs
-
real
photographs
that
actually
exist
-
that
ive
seen
in
chronological
order
first
i
saw
a
photo
of
myself
as
an
infant
being
held
by
my
parents
as
quickly
as
i
saw
it
it
was
replaced
by
next
photo
i
was
a
little
older
held
by
my
dad
these
are
real
photos
that
exist
in
various
family
albums
i
watched
myself
aging
it
was
very
surreal
there
was
a
photo
of
me
and
my
sister
watching
tv
a
photo
of
us
playing
in
the
park
a
photo
of
me
in
a
white
tuxedo
in
church
for
first
communion
they
came
faster
and
faster
photo
after
photo
time
was
speeding
up
i
saw
a
picture
my
sister
had
taken
of
her
my
dad
and
i
on
a
ski-lift
together
more
and
more
i
saw
what
seemed
like
50-100
pictures

the
final
picture
i
saw
was
a
picture
i
had
taken
myself
i
had
been
doing
a
lot
of
drugs
and
was
homeless
and
living
in
a
tent
i
took
the
picture
of
myself
in
front
of
this
tent
looking
disheveled
unhappy
like
a
loser
who
had
wasted
his
life
and
thrown
away
his
family

the
contrast
of
that
bright
smiling
face
of
the
young
kid
in
the
white
tuxedo
to
the
unshaven
unkempt
drugged
out
hippie
in
front
of
his
tent
seemed
to
sum
up
my
lifes
trajectory

this
was
death
after
all
there
was
no
going
back
i
remember
thinking
oh
my
god

the
final
picture
fell
away
-
some
2-3
seconds
after
the
breaking
through
the
veil
-
and
i
was
in
hell
just
infinity
solitude
with
my
pain
and
failures
echoing
around
me
i
felt
the
presence
of
god
but
in
an
impersonal
sort
of
way
it
wasnt
like
i
was
being
punished
the
transition
from
life
to
death
was
the
transition
from
the
finite
to
the
infinite
my
finite
failures
became
infinite
it
was
natural
this
was
the
fate
i
had
chosen
-
what
all
my
life
had
led
up
to
all
of
my
decisions
my
state
of
mind
were
multiplied
times
infinity

the
nature
of
the
hell
i
experienced
is
difficult
to
describe
i
was
in
a
tremendously
large
volume
of
space
all
fractal
chaos
there
are
various
impressions
of
my
body
being
torqued
and
twisted
at
absurd
speeds
into
incomprehensible
angles
spinning
twisting
rocketing
through
space
i
have
this
memory
of
a
face
-
my
face
-
protruding
out
of
the
surface
of
an
infinite
featureless
plain
my
eyes
spinning
madly
in
their
sockets
while
a
thousand
different
and
pained
expressions
played
across
the
features
of
my
face
but
these
are
just
symbols
fragmented
impressions
of
what
really
happened

i
dont
believe
being
burned
alive
at
the
stake
would
be
a
more
distressing
experience

each
moment
of
this
was
the
first
moment
it
was
like
being
born
into
hell
each
moment
in
that
sense
it
was
eternity
i
had
already
been
there
for
eternity
i
need
to
emphasize
that
word
-
eternity
thats
different
then
a
long
time
or
a
thousand
years
or
a
million
years
eternity
is
forever
it
was
a
place
more
fundamental
than
this
3d
waking
life
-
a
place
where
i
had
always
been
it
was
beyond
time

finally
the
absurdity
began
to
slow
as
i
began
to
come
down
i
was
sure
that
i
was
brain-damaged
i
knew
i
had
destroyed
myself
i
wanted
to
tell
my
sister
not
to
make
the
same
mistakes
i
had
made
i
needed
to
talk
to
her
i
crawled
on
the
ground
into
the
house
looking
for
a
phone
my
friends
followed
me
trying
to
calm
me
down
a
few
minutes
later
when
i
had
finally
come
down
a
bit
more
my
friends
asked
me
what
i
had
experienced

all
i
could
say
frantically
and
amazed
was
i
exist
i
exist
i
exist
this
exists
i
exist
oh
my
god
i
exist

as
i
came
down
even
more
i
became
euphoric
that
i
had
made
it
back
i
was
grinning
almost
crying
i
couldnt
believe
i
had
survived

still
i
was
a
different
person
for
4
months
i
experienced
profound
mood
swings
sometimes
reality
would
suddenly
lose
its
emotional
content
in
a
crowded
room
for
example
instead
of
seeing
people
in
front
of
me
i
would
see
matter
no
different
from
rocks
i
saw
bodies
engaged
in
activities
but
no
sense
of
humanity
to
them
these
experiences
would
last
a
few
seconds
and
were
rather
disconcerting
the
dmt
imagery
also
affected
other
psychedelic
use
eating
cactus
doing
mushrooms
even
smoking
weed
would
bring
back
images
that
i
hadnt
been
able
to
integrate
images
of
my
own
personal
hell
over
the
months
these
issues
faded
away
as
i
integrated
the
experience

over
the
months
these
issues
faded
away
as
i
integrated
the
experience

i
have
since
grown
to
be
thankful
for
what
i
experienced
even
though
it
still
makes
me
shudder
to
think
about
some
of
the
deeper
aspects
of
the
trip

its
been
two
years
now
ill
never
be
the
same
of
course
i
no
longer
have
any
doubt
that
i
am
an
eternal
being
-
this
is
a
certainty
to
me
now
i
value
my
life
immensely
in
a
different
way
than
i
ever
have
could
before
it
was
something
i
was
meant
to
experience
and
has
drastically
affected
my
choices
in
four
days
im
going
back
to
college
ive
still
got
my
problems
but
im
doing
something
with
my
life
whatever
that
is
maybe
dmt
has
something
to
do
with
that

ill
likely
never
smoke
dmt
again
because
frankly
i
dont
believe
thats
how
its
meant
to
be
consumed
i
will
very
likely
consume
ayahuasca
in
a
traditional
ceremony
in
the
near
future
i
even
expect
to
find
my
way
back
to
hell
i
have
unfinished
business
there
but
im
hoping
to
ease
my
way
into
that
realm
in
a
way
thats
more
workable
than
going
from
0
to
5000mph
in
14
seconds
aka
5
minutes
of
hardcore
tripping
peaking
harder
than
youve
ever
comprehended
was
possible

so
in
short
make
sure
you
have
a
sturdy
chair
when
you
smoke
dmt




\x93in
which
our
hero
doses
on
methylone
smokes
a
large
amount
of
cannabis
and
then
working
his
way
up
to
a
high
dose
of
smoked
dmt
is
forced
to
battle
with
a
malevolent
dmt
entity
who
subjects
him
to
a
magical
attack

this
is
an
experience
of
smoking
dmt
while
on
the
plateau
and
come-down
from
methylone

the
methylone
was
nice

empathic
euphoric
and
stimulating

i
had
smoked
a
bunch
of
strong
weed
as
well
and
drank
a
little
wine

i
decided
to
smoke
some
dmt

i
tried
a
few
times
but
without
too
much
success
i
only
managed
to
vaporize
a
little
and
had
mild
but
interesting
dmt
trips
they
were
not
unpleasant
although
on
one
i
did
see
a
lizard-alien
type
creature
amid
the
closed-eye
hallucinations

i
have
seen
them
before
and
though
i
think
it
is
rather
superstitious
of
me
it
always
slightly
alarms
me

for
the
most
part
however
these
experiences
were
slightly
euphoric
transcendent
and
pleasant
experiences

but
emboldened
by
the
methylone
i
thought
that
just
wasnt
enough

i
put
about
60
mg
of
dmt
into
the
bowl
of
my
bong
on
top
of
some
weed
and
vaporized
most
or
all
of
it
in
2
big
hits

the
high-dose
dmt
experience
is
utterly
different
than
a
moderate
or
low-dose
experience
for
me

i
crossed
a
threshold

my
field
of
vision
contemplated
an
empty
black
space
in
the
center
with
morphing
3-dimensional
geometric
shapes
gyrating
on
both
sides
i
remembered
the
high-dose
dmt
space
and
the
fact
that
it
transforms
reality
into
something
completely
unrecognizable
though
not
necessarily
beautiful
or
transcendent

in
fact
for
me
it
is
more
likely
to
be
colorful
but
somewhat
flat
machine-like
and
even
cartoonish



i
realized
i
was
tripping
extra
hard
and
that
the
experience
was
about
to
just
take
over
completely

for
just
a
second
i
wondered
if
this
was
going
to
be
a
breakthrough

i
then
felt
myself
being
propelled
forward
at
astonishing
speed

however
i
could
tell
that
i
was
being
propelled
towards
something
i
might
not
want
to
experience
at
all

my
resistance
and
fear
took
hold

within
less
than
a
second
i
saw
my
destination

it
was
the
dmt
spirit
personified
as
a
female
demoness

i
have
met
her
before
only
once
on
my
first
ever
dmt
experience
in
which
she
welcomed
me
and
told
me
she
was
the
\x93queen
of
spice
as
i
looked
into
her
face
with
horror
her
voice
told
me
\x93welcome
to
your
nightmare

with
a
rush
i
was
being
sucked
down
into
an
experience
that
i
had
created
for
myself
or
that
the
dmt
entity
had
created
for
me

it
was
going
to
be
my
ultimate
nightmare
tailor-made
just
for
me

it
looked
like
it
was
going
to
have
a
prosaic
real-world
theme
-

being
tortured
or
something
unpleasant
-

but
transformed
and
reconfigured
into
the
machine-like
fractalizing
cinematic
totality
of
the
high-dose
dmt
experience


something
within
me
revolted

i
used
my
fear
and
willpower
to
direct
myself
away
from
the
nightmare
tunnel

i
cleared
an
empty
space
for
myself
in
my
consciousness
and
told
the
dmt
entity
or
entities
that
i
would
not
submit
to
this
that
i
had
not
come
into
their
space
for
this
experience

and
that
i
sought
higher
goals

truth
not
nightmare
scenarios
fractalized
and
engineered
by
hostile
entities

transcendence
not
a
scifi-dmt
horrorshow


i
could
now
see
a
male
dmt
entity
or
more
properly
at
that
time
\x93the
dmt
entity

he
was
not
a
tyke
or
elf
or
alien

but
the
spirit
of
the
substance
a
resplendent
god

part
south
american
indigenous
deity
part
futuristic
machineic-being

and
he
was
angry

i
had
refused
his
gift
and
possibly
his
woman
who
bore
the
gift
as
well


he
roared
at
me
infuriated
by
my
disrespect
and
refusal
to
go
along
with
the
evenings
planned
entertainment




within
moments
i
was
subjected
to
what
i
can
only
think
of
as
a
magical
attack

the
dmt
entity
was
breaking
my
reality
into
pieces
rapidly
throwing
things
at
my
consciousness
and
essentially
toying
with
me
showing
me
what
he
could
do

i
was
afraid
but
in
some
way
i
was
also
buoyed
by
my
ability
to
withstand
the
attack
and
to
have
enough
control
to
not
have
to
submit
to
the
nightmare
scenario

as
my
consciousness
splintered
in
my
mind
i
was
able
to
word
a
simple
phrase
of
resistance

\x93i
dont
care

this
seemed
to
be
the
spell
i
needed
to
rob
the
dmt
entity
of
his
anger

he
relented
and
the
attack
stopped

if
i
didnt
care
what
was
the
point

still
i
felt
his
displeasure
at
my
lack
of
respect
and
cooperation

as
suddenly
as
it
started
it
was
over

i
was
back
in
my
room

less
than
5
minutes
had
passed

i
felt
utterly
drained
exhausted
disappointed
and
confused

i
seek
insights
from
dmt
i
seek
beauty
i
seek
the
other-worldy
the
transcendent
the
numinous

instead
i
was
taken
over
by
a
hostile
and
superficial
experience
threatened
with
my
personalized
ultimate
nightmare
and
subjected
to
magickal
attack

i
checked
myself
and
realized
that
overall
i
felt
ok
-
i
had
survived
without
much
consequence
an
avid
pot-smoker
my
forgetting
skills
are
sharply
honed
and
i
decided
not
to
let
this
trouble
me
much
further
but
still
i
wondered
if
the
dmt
gods
hate
me
if
i
reject
their
gifts
of
nightmares
what
can
i
expect
from
use
of
this
substance
in
the
future



i
have
been
schooled
that
during
a
psychedelic
trip
one
needs
to
relax
let
go
and
experience
whatever
the
substance
has
in
store
for
you
i
think
this
is
generally
good
advice

maybe
if
i
had
been
wiling
to
let
myself
experience
the
nightmare
it
would
have
ended
with
an
experience
of
transcendence

maybe
i
lost
a
valuable
opportunity
to
face
my
own
fears
and
conquer
them



however
this
experience
also
showed
me
something
about
control

having
control
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing

i
also
for
the
first
time
understood
intuitively
the
shamanic
use
of
icaros
during
ayahuasca
ceremonies

icaros
are
not
just
songs

they
direct
the
ayahuasca
experience

maybe
i
needed
an
icaro
of
my
own
as
this
entire
experience
occurred
in
silence

in
any
case
i
will
be
more
careful
of
set
and
setting
before
my
next
high-dose
dmt
experience




when
i
ventured
into
my
dmt
trip
the
last
thing
i
was
expecting
was
to
ego
death
i
happen
to
have
a
readily
available
and
reliable
source
of
dmt
and
i
was
bored
one
night
so
decided
to
do
it
it
was
my
second
time
doing
dmt
my
first
trip
being
around
30
mg
insufflated
this
was
a
very
mild
trip
and
did
not
really
excite
me
much
of
the
potential
of
a
dmt
trip
i
remember
emotionally
connecting
with
and
communicating
with
a
microwave
and
some
brief
breathing
visuals
but
not
much
else
nothing
very
intellecutal
or
deep
with
this
experince
in
mind
i
decided
to
up
my
dosage
to
55
mg
looking
for
a
much
more
intense
trip
not
neccessarily
ego
death
but
at
least
an
intense
dmt
trip
that
i
had
read
is
associated
with
this
drug
i
ended
up
with
a
life
changing
experience
and
possibly
one
of
the
best
and
worst
drug
experiences
of
my
entire
life

so
i
weighed
out
55mg
and
insufflated
it
all
in
one
line
the
burn
is
not
instantaneous
but
it
hit
me
about
ten
minutes
later
and
got
progressively
worse
until
my
trip
was
over
all
i
can
say
is
water
is
a
definately
a
dmt
insufflators
best
friend
side
effects
of
insufflation
included
burning
in
my
nostril
and
throat
from
the
drip
a
watery
eye
on
the
side
in
which
the
dmt
was
insufflated
and
a
runny
nostril
the
burn
was
bad
though
not
nearly
as
bad
as
the
burn
from
railing
8
mg
of
2ce
all
i
can
remember
was
repeatedly
saying
why
did
i
do
this
to
myself


then
the
intense
and
slightly
scary
patterns
and
psychadelic
open
eye
visuals
began
occuring
as
well
as
a
slight
body
buzz
and
the
desk
i
was
sitting
at
was
breathing
with
me
amazingly
each
time
i
breathed
in
the
desk
would
expand
and
move
more
than
ive
ever
seen
before
on
any
psychadelic
expanding
inches
at
a
time
as
though
it
were
more
alive
than
i
were
i
felt
naseous
for
about
1
minute
and
had
an
empty
black
trash
can
by
my
side
incase
i
were
to
vomit
during
the
minute
i
felt
as
though
i
would
vomit
i
held
the
trash
can
to
my
face
and
looked
in
to
it
preparing
for
vomit
to
expell
from
my
mouth
instead
when
i
looked
into
the
trash
can
it
was
as
if
i
were
going
to
be
sucked
in
to
a
black
hole
of
death
evil
and
darkness
if
i
were
to
puke
into
it

in
that
moment
i
felt
as
though
an
outside
force
was
taking
over
my
body
as
if
my
entire
body
was
no
longer
mine
to
control
although
i
have
read
many
ego
death
experiences
on
psychadelics
and
have
friends
who
have
recounted
their
experiences
to
me
i
did
not
realize
that
the
amount
of
dmt
i
had
insufflated
had
the
possiblity
to
lead
to
ego
death
and
was
certainly
not
ready
for
it
if
it
is
even
possible
to
be
feeling
entirely
scared
and
unprepared
i
convinced
myself
not
to
throw
up
and
not
to
succumb
to
the
black
hole
of
darkness
that
was
present
in
the
trash
can
and
came
back
up
for
air
breathing
deeply
the
moment
i
regained
control
of
my
body
all
i
could
say
was
i
think
im
going
to
die
and
began
frantically
asking
my
friend/trip
sitter
to
assure
me
that
people
have
done
more
dmt
than
i
did
and
that
i
was
going
to
be
alright
it
was
the
most
physically
painful
thing
i
have
ever
been
through
and
i
was
scared
beyond
belief
little
did
i
know
this
was
just
the
beginning
of
the
trip
and
that
in
the
remaining
portion
i
was
in
for
the
ride
of
my
life

i
needed
to
lie
down
and
be
in
darkness
i
had
my
friend
turn
off
all
of
the
lights
and
made
my
way
to
the
bed
in
the
room
controlling
my
body
attempting
to
move
and
walk
was
all
so
foreign
to
me
it
was
as
if
i
had
a
600
pound
body
a
massive
amount
of
weight
that
i
simply
could
not
control
i
felt
like
bambi
attempting
to
walk
for
the
first
time
luckily
the
bed
wasnt
too
far
and
i
was
able
to
make
my
way
on
to
it
lying
down
while
experiencing
excruciating
physical
pain
i
told
myself
that
whatever
it
was
that
was
going
on
with
me
no
matter
how
terrifying
i
had
gotten
myself
into
this
and
at
this
point
had
no
other
option
but
to
face
it
and
come
out
on
the
other
side
at
this
point
all
the
lights
were
off
i
was
in
total
darkness
and
had
requested
that
my
friend
no
longer
speak
to
me
all
i
could
do
was
succumb
to
the
trip
to
everything
bad
taking
over
my
mind
and
ride
it
out
the
best
i
could

i
closed
my
eyes
and
immediately
close
eyed
visuals
occured
there
were
cloaked
skeleton
figures
with
peircingly
evil
red
and
green
laser
like
light
projecting
from
their
eyes
and
i
could
tell
they
were
there
to
take
me
for
lack
of
better
words
these
were
the
most
evil
beings
i
had
ever
experienced
in
my
entire
life
but
i
had
no
choice
but
to
succumb
to
their
evil
and
follow
the
steps
they
were
leading
me
on
i
covered
my
entire
face
and
body
with
a
black
comforter
to
isolate
myself
from
any
grounding
or
worldly
physical
thing
as
i
felt
i
had
to
go
through
this
alone
and
depart
from
any
existant
reality
the
next
15
or
so
minutes
was
the
most
intense
trip
i
have
ever
been
on
in
my
entire
life

at
this
point
i
was
physically
writhing
in
pain
or
at
least
i
felt
i
was
and
was
crying
like
mad
i
was
so
scared
the
cloaked
beings
and
i
were
traveling
through
a
tunnel
of
this
evil
green
and
red
florescent
peircing
light
flying
past
me
and
it
was
as
if
i
was
on
the
worlds
fastest
and
darkest
roller
coaster
yet
simultaneously
felt
as
though
i
was
stationary
and
not
making
any
progress
through
this
tunnel
all
i
wanted
was
to
get
through
to
the
other
side
progressively
through
this
part
of
the
trip
the
peircing
light
and
close
eyed
visuals
became
less
and
less
as
the
darkness
was
gradually
taking
over
and
when
i
traveled
through
the
tunnel
everything
eventually
turned
pitch
black
when
i
reached
the
point
of
ego
death
as
if
all
of
the
good
and
light
had
been
taken
out
of
the
world
the
emotional
pain
however
was
just
about
to
begin

the
first
thing
i
had
to
do
in
this
journey
on
these
steps
that
the
cloaked
creatures
were
leading
me
on
was
to
let
go
of
every
inhibition
i
had
and
for
me
mostly
my
physical
insecurities
and
inhibitions
i
could
no
longer
care
about
something
as
trivial
as
my
physical
being
or
appearance
i
had
to
let
go
in
order
to
be
consumed
i
could
no
longer
be
in
control
of
my
physical
body
so
i
let
go
and
i
stopped
caring
about
control
as
the
snot
and
tears
ran
down
my
face
then
they
had
me
focus
in
on
the
worst
experience
the
lowest
feeling
i
had
ever
felt
in
my
entire
life
for
me
this
was
a
detailed
experience
with
my
dad
that
i
wont
get
into
but
lets
just
say
that
i
had
to
focus
on
the
intense
amount
of
pain
that
i
had
felt
at
the
time

the
cloaked
figures
proceeded
to
flash
previous
psychadelic
experiences
of
mine
before
me
each
of
which
turned
into
pictures
which
were
lit
on
fire
by
the
laser
like
light
shot
out
of
their
eyes
exploding
and
bursting
into
flame
before
me
these
spirits
were
angry
at
me
for
avoiding
ego
death
in
these
previous
experiences
and
assured
me
that
the
person
who
had
saved
me
and
grounded
me
back
to
reality
allowing
me
to
avoid
ego
death
previously
would
not
help
me
this
time
although
the
person
had
been
physically
around
me
during
these
previous
experiences
and
was
not
on
this
one
i
feel
that
his
actual
physical
presence
had
little
to
do
with
this

the
cloaked
figures
continued
to
have
me
focus
on
my
most
painful
experience
what
had
to
be
the
worst
amount
of
physical
and
emotional
pain
i
had
ever
felt
in
my
entire
life
the
whole
time
i
was
crying
violently
breathing
so
sharply
and
heavily
almost
as
if
i
were
physically
dying
by
running
out
of
air
to
breathe
besides
being
emotionally
painful
it
was
incredibly
physically
painful
plus
i
could
still
feel
the
throbbing
pain
from
the
burn
in
my
nose
as
if
it
were
causing
pain
to
my
entire
body
some
outside
force
was
controlling
my
body
and
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
would
be
as
the
opposite
of
an
exorcism

i
began
to
have
this
conversation
in
my
head
with
the
cloaked
figures
about
my
father
and
all
the
pain
and
aguish
i
felt
toward
him
i
focused
on
how
awful
he
was
how
it
was
unbelievable
that
anyone
could
ever
put
their
own
flesh
and
blood
someone
they
created
through
the
most
intimate
act
through
so
much
pain
how
he
was
supposed
to
care
for
me
and
how
the
pain
he
had
made
me
feel
was
unbelievable
and
surreal
in
the
worst
way
reaching
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
good
in
him
i
continued
to
have
this
conversation
in
my
head
with
the
cloaked
figures
talking
in
circles
repeating
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
until
the
cloaked
figures
presented
my
dad
and
i
was
now
having
this
conversation
directly
to
him
getting
more
and
more
progressively
angry
as
i
went
on
but
that
never
reached
a
definitive
end

the
next
thing
i
had
to
do
on
this
journey
was
to
forget
all
the
good
in
the
world
everything
that
could
have
possibly
kept
me
grounded
to
a
worldly
reality
anything
that
was
possibly
any
remote
good
to
continue
living
for
i
had
to
believe
in
this
genuinely
it
couldnt
be
faked
as
the
cloaked
creatures
could
sense
everyting
i
had
to
forget
that
my
friend
trip
sitting
me
in
the
room
existed
and
the
friend
who
had
prior
saved
me
from
ego
death
also
had
to
be
discredited
as
not
having
any
good
or
anything
worth
living
for
as
it
was
thinking
he
was
there
for
me
and
worth
living
for
that
had
saved
me
from
ego
death
previously
i
had
to
focus
on
all
of
the
bad
qualities
about
him
and
turn
him
into
something
evil
and
believe
that
there
was
nothing
good
in
him
and
thats
why
he
couldnt
and
wouldnt
save
me
soon
a
picture
of
him
appeared
and
exploded
as
well
in
the
same
manner
as
previously
described
the
cloaked
creatures
were
right
and
he
could
no
longer
save
me

then
there
came
the
final
step
in
order
to
complete
this
process
i
had
to
admit
everything
i
was
thinking
everything
that
was
running
through
my
head
by
saying
it
out
loud
it
was
as
if
i
had
to
prove
that
i
believed
it
all
to
these
cloaked
figures
but
also
to
myself
and
that
the
only
way
to
do
that
was
to
say
it
that
was
the
ultimate
way
to
succumb
to
their
control
to
have
all
inhibitions
forgotten
to
forget
myself
and
my
own
ego
i
knew
it
would
seem
crazy
but
i
had
to
do
it
i
had
no
other
choice
so
i
began
at
the
beginning
recounting
to
myself
the
issues
with
my
father
saying
it
all
out
loud
it
felt
as
though
i
was
emotionally
and
angrily
screaming
it
though
my
trip
sitter
said
he
never
understood
a
word
as
it
was
faint
and
whispered
then
i
moved
to
admitting
my
friend
was
not
good
but
bad
and
that
he
couldnt
save
me
i
had
to
give
up
all
the
good
i
could
think
of
that
mattered
to
me
and
believe
that
it
didnt
exist

finally
i
had
to
say
my
final
thought
out
loud
i
said
clearly
and
definitively
out
loud
but
what
my
friend
described
as
inaudible
it
is
all
bad
there
is
no
good
left
in
the
world
there
is
nothing
good
worth
living
for
nothing
good
nothing
none
i
felt
this
intense
amount
of
emotion
as
i
truly
believed
what
i
had
just
said
then
it
all
went
pitch
black
and
i
died
i
embraced
everything
evil
in
the
world
through
my
own
painful
life
experiences
so
much
so
that
i
truly
believed
that
good
did
not
exist
in
the
world
and
there
was
nothing
worth
living
for
in
order
to
die
i
had
to
believe
it
and
when
i
did
the
journey
with
the
cloaked
figures
was
over
and
i
died
succumbing
to
the
pitch
blackness
loosing
the
most
ultimate
control
of
life


unfortunately
my
friends
roommate
came
into
the
room
right
at
this
point
noisly
and
turned
on
the
lights
and
the
trip
was
lost
i
never
did
get
through
to
the
otherside
of
that
tunnel
i
never
got
to
see
what
was
on
the
other
side
of
death
or
to
attempt
to
recover
from
the
scariest
experience
of
my
entire
life
but
i
did
ego
death
and
it
was
amazing
the
best
way
to
describe
it
as
would
be
the
most
painful
experience
but
the
best
learning
experience
i
have
ever
gone
through
on
any
psychadelic
after
effects
included
a
feeling
of
rebirth
as
if
everything
were
brand
new
and
an
intense
new
appreciation
for
everything
in
life
including
small
insignifacant
things
it
was
totally
worth
it
the
only
upset
was
the
unbelievably
large
amount
of
mucus
being
produced
by
my
nose
afterwards
regardless
of
all
the
pain
i
am
glad
i
chose
to
rail
a
heavy
dose
of
dmt
i
dont
think
i
could
expect
or
be
prepared
for
ego
death
i
had
to
just
grab
it
by
the
horns
as
it
came
to
me
which
is
what
i
did
and
ill
never
look
back




i
started
the
night
by
going
out
to
eat
with
my
little
sister
we
had
a
great
time
eating
and
laughing
and
just
generally
talking
after
our
meal
i
dropped
her
off
at
my
moms
house
and
went
to
my
friends
house
i
will
call
my
two
friends
john
and
jane
it
was
dark
by
now
and
rain
was
coming
down
really
hard
i
finally
got
to
their
house
and
we
were
up
in
janes
room
we
were
listening
to
bluetech
and
some
other
bands
mimosa
was
another
i
think
we
were
just
drinking
and
talking
and
eventually
we
started
coloring
and
making
a
collage
after
about
an
hour
of
coloring
and
watching
planet
earth
on
mute
to
music
john
pulled
out
his
lil
glass
pipe
with
the
dmt
already
loaded
in
it

i
have
smoked
it
once
before
and
while
i
didnt
really
get
too
far
i
definitely
had
my
first
brush
with
a
dmt
spirit

i
blasted
off
for
the
first
time
with
richard
wagners
lohengrin-prelude
playing
in
the
background
it
really
helped
to
calm
me
down
and
set
a
good
mood
personally
at
least
i
remember
during
the
first
time
an
amazingly
vivid
and
flowing
feminine
like
spirit
was
looking
at
me
she
didnt
say
anything
but
she
did
touch
me
kind
of
when
i
say
touch
i
mean
that
a
bit
of
this
spirit
tapped
my
forehead
almost
and
with
that
viscous
bubbling
saffron
orange
energy
seemed
to
rupture
in
front
of
my
eyes
and
i
was
swept
away
the
whole
thing
was
very
calm
i
did
notice
on
the
fringes
a
darker
side
to
it
all
though
black
jagged
lines
and
slithering
hisses
taking
stabs
towards
the
center
of
my
vision
they
were
swept
away
each
time
though
as
the
orange
bubbling
energy
constantly
expanded
outwards


when
i
opened
my
eyes
it
was
over
for
the
most
part
as
quickly
as
it
began
it
faded
away
and
it
left
me
dazed

anyways
back
to
janes
room
jane
had
turned
off
the
main
lights
and
the
room
was
illuminated
by
stars
with
lights
behind
them
on
the
wall
these
seemingly
innocent
looking
stars
would
later
morph
into
terrible
looking
things
it
was
a
dark
purple
color
in
the
room
some
sort
of
shamanistic
music
was
playing
in
the
background
i
cant
remember
the
artists
name
john
held
the
pipe
for
me
as
i
took
a
very
large
hit
instantly
after
i
let
out
my
breath
i
felt
it
a
new
perceptiveness
to
color
a
heavy
feeling
all
over
my
body
the
second
hit
was
larger
and
when
i
exhaled
i
started
feeling
hollow
weak
in
the
limbs
it
was
hard
to
support
my
upper
body
with
my
arms
the
background
started
blurring
and
i
could
hear
the
music
being
distorted
i
started
taking
the
third
hit
and
i
took
as
much
as
i
could
in
i
tried
to
hold
it
for
as
long
as
i
could
but
i
lost
the
ability
to
hold
my
body
up
and
as
i
fell
back
into
the
bed
i
exhaled

as
soon
as
my
head
hit
the
pillow
i
was
there
but
things
werent
like
last
time
i
saw
the
orange
being
in
the
distance
but
she
was
being
held
back
by
vines
of
blackness
then
i
heard
the
hissing
again

it
is
at
this
point
that
i
want
to
tell
the
reader
that
i
honestly
felt
the
sensation
of
terror
i
was
literally
terrified
by
what
was
about
to
happen
the
lamp
in
front
of
me
fractured
and
broke
down
into
2d
layers
that
then
were
splayed
out
like
a
slinky
i
noticed
the
ceilings
colors
shift
from
gray
purple
to
a
cascade
of
earthy
plant
like
colors
green
purple
brown
black
the
black
gave
way
to
the
beings
i
met
these
three
spirits
came
in
from
varying
angles
and
in
different
forms
all
of
them
felt
malicious
and
sinister
they
kept
circling
me
and
asking
me
questions
as
they
came
closer


why
have
you
come
here
do
you
really
think
you
can
come
here
this
is
not
your
place
why
do
you
think
you
can
be
with
us
why
do
you
think
you
can
come
here

they
asked
me
these
questions
repeatedly
as
they
engulfed
me
i
felt
like
i
couldnt
breathe
and
i
opened
my
eyes
but
the
room
was
not
what
it
was
before
i
looked
towards
the
door
my
way
out
but
it
stretched
away
from
me

you
can
not
leave
yet
they
said
come
back

i
closed
my
eyes
again
and
what
happened
was
so
moving
it
still
makes
shudder
these
dark
spirits
had
twisted
together
in
a
black
and
purple
pulsating
cocoon
around
me
jagged
edges
sharp
tips
they
were
extremely
threatening
they
made
me
feel
every
negative
emotion
i
have
in
my
human
form
they
showed
me
what
it
feels
like
to
be
completely
alone
in
the
darkness
with
no
escape
i
felt
an
immense
pain
in
my
lips
and
lungs
i
felt
utterly
hopeless
surrounded
by
all
the
negativity
in
the
world
the
suffering
the
endless
pain
that
exists
surrounded
by
malice
and
hatred
evil
my
breathing
was
very
sharp
and
rapid
i
think

then
they
stepped
back
the
orange
girl
in
the
distance
was
coming
closer
as
she
approached
the
darkness
peeled
back
and
let
her
near
i
got
the
sense
that
it
was
actually
the
orange
girl
that
had
called
upon
these
three
dark
things
at
this
stage
i
had
taken
control
of
my
breathing
she
said
to
me

this
is
how
it
is
this
aspect
of
it
at
least
you
always
have
a
choice
you
always
have
a
choice

i
remember
telling
the
girl
that
i
did
not
like
them
the
dark
ones
i
did
not
like
them
at
all
i
hated
them
i
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
them
she
responded
by
making
the
blackness
reveal
itself
they
were
extensions
of
the
girl
tentacles
almost

why
did
you
do
that
to
me
i
asked
you
needed
to
see
what
we
live
in
this
is
our
domain
this
is
the
way
it
is
you
will
learn
more
soon

i
opened
my
eyes
and
i
was
back
in
the
room
i
remembered
but
i
still
had
the
visuals
equivalent
to
a
massive
dose
of
lsd
i
remember
having
the
sensation
of
fear
thankfulness
and
love
at
the
same
time
i
was
afraid
of
what
i
had
seen
but
then
i
realized
that
nothing
was
malicious
about
what
had
happened
i
thought
the
orange
girl
had
betrayed
me
but
she
had
really
just
helped
me
out
she
was
trying
to
show
me
her
world
at
least
a
part
of
her
world
i
then
became
very
very
calm
it
was
as
if
she
had
flipped
a
switch
in
my
mind
i
felt
love
for
the
earth
gravity
life
in
general

the
buddhists
say
that
life
is
suffering
but
to
attain
enlightenment
you
must
accept
it
acceptance
that
life
is
suffering
is
the
first
step
to
nirvana
well
i
feel
that
i
accepted
it
that
night
she
thrust
me
into
the
darkest
well
of
my
mind
she
showed
me
what
it
looked
and
felt
like
to
suffer
but
not
in
a
bad
way
she
remembered
to
tell
me
that
there
is
always
a
choice
i
still
dont
know
what
that
means
but
i
think
that
she
wanted
me
to
know
that
there
is
more
to
life
than
suffering
more
than
the
blackness
more
than
the
void
that
if
we
choose
to
walk
a
higher
path
it
exists
but
it
is
hard
to
navigate
but
that
there
are
those
who
will
help
you
should
you
choose
that
higher
path



i
know
this
story
sounds
out
there
but
it
all
happened
with
such
vivid
clarity
it
wasnt
like
the
drug
changed
my
surroundings
it
just
widened
my
spectrum
of
what
i
see
it
was
as
if
i
gained
the
ability
to
see
radio
waves
or
sound
waves
to
see
what
is
there
but
not
visible
to
us
it
is
always
there
but
we
are
conditioned
to
mute
it
out
that
there
are
other
beings
in
this
realm
that
we
can
not
perceive
but
are
always
there
there
is
a
yin
to
every
yang
and
existence/consciousness
doesnt
stop
past
the
visible
spectrum
of
light

that
is
what
i
would
have
to
say
to
sum
it
all
up
all
in
all
it
was
an
amazing
experience
even
though
it
was
very
dark
and
what
some
more
inexperienced
psychonaughts
might
call
a
bad
trip
i
feel
like
i
gained
a
priceless
lesson
i
am
ready
to
meet
the
saffron
orange
girl
again
but
this
time
i
want
to
follow
her
and
see
where
the
others
are
she
did
mention
that
she
was
not
the
only
one
that
there
many
like
her
and
many
that
were
very
different
from
her




most
people
familiar
with
dmt
have
either
taken
oral
doses
with
maois
or
have
smoked
it
as
the
freebase

i
have
done
both
and
have
had
many
awe
inspiring
experiences

experiences
on
dmt
via
other
routes
of
administration
are
more
rare

by
other
i
mean
injection

intramuscular
injection
was
maybe
is
popular
for
legitamite
study
personally
i
dont
care
for
the
hassle
and
muscle
stiffness
of
this
route
of
administration
when
the
same
effects
and
onset
can
be
expected
from
smoking



intravenous
injection
is
another
matter
entirely

most
people
would
describe
smoking
dmt
as
like
getting
hit
with
a
ton
of
bricks

iv
dmt
is
like
getting
hit
with
a
small
planet

what
follows
is
my
last
and
most
intense
experience
with
dmt
acetate
iv



about
one
year
ago
i
decided
to
clear
out
my
closet
and
found
something
like
400
grams
of
mimosa
hostillis
root
bark
left
over
from
the
previous
year
before
i
moved
in
with
roommates
who
were
somewhat
anti-drug

not
wanting
to
have
that
sort
of
thing
just
lying
around
i
decided
to
dispose
of
it

over
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
i
extracted
over
a
gram
of
dmt
i
dont
remember
the
exact
quantities
but
i
do
remember
it
was
enough
for
me
and
my
friends
to
trip
for
quite
some
time

wanting
to
fully
experience
dmt
in
all
of
its
forms
i
had
decided
to
experiment
with
iv
administration
about
a
month
earlier

having
had
a
bad
experience
the
previous
year
trying
with
the
hydrochloride
salt
i
decided
to
try
with
the
acetate
salt

i
was
successful
and
really
impressed
with
the
intensity
of
it

at
around
as
low
as
1/6
the
active
dose
of
the
smoked
form
i
was
thrust
immediately
even
more
immediately
than
smoking
into
the
trip

it
is
like
those
roller
coasters
that
suddenly
launch
you
down
the
track
like
a
rocket

unfortunatly
the
initial
euphoria
i
usually
get
with
smoking
it
is
replaced
with
a
jolt
a
holy
shit
feeling
but
the
other
effects
are
usually
the
same
just
amplified
slightly

i
say
usually
because
at
higher
doses
this
is
not
true

this
happens
to
be
the
case
here

it
was
mid-afternoon
mid-autumn
at
the
house
that
i
lived
in
with
two
roommates

one
was
home

i
really
didnt
like
living
there
because
the
guy
that
was
there
was
a
real
asshole

he
had
specificly
asked
me
when
i
moved
in
not
to
extract
dmt
there
but
i
asked
him
years
ago
to
not
be
such
an
asshole
so
we
ended
up
with
a
case
of
you
get
what
you
give

it
was
a
beatiful
day
and
i
was
in
a
good
mood
but
bored
and
dreading
a
class
i
would
be
heading
to
in
about
50
minutes

i
dont
remember
what
class
but
i
remember
knowing
i
would
be
bored
out
of
my
skull



to
spice
things
things
up
i
decided
to
do
a
little
experiment

i
wanted
to
try
an
iv
dose
the
same
size
as
a
small
smoked
dose

i
cant
recall
the
size
maybe
40-80
mg

this
was
prepared
by
filling
a
1
cc
syringe
full
of
distilled
water

60
units
are
added
to
a
bottle
cap
40
to
a
spoon
to
the
cap
was
added
a
few
drops
of
lab
grade
glacial
acetic
acid
from
an
eyedropper

the
dmt
was
added
to
the
spoon
and
heated
lightly
until
it
softened

a
couple
drops
of
the
dilute
acid
was
added
and
the
spoon
was
heated

this
was
repeated
as
many
times
as
necessary
to
fully
dissolve
the
dmt



i
discovered
the
first
time
doing
this
that
adding
too
much
acid
was
very
bad
it
causes
mild
acute
acidosis

i
got
an
odd
and
uncomfortable
push

breathing
sped
up
dramaticaly
and
i
could
actually
taste
vinegar
as
i
exhaled

it
also
caused
pain
at
the
injection
site

blood
is
slightly
basic
and
is
buffered
so
this
lasts
only
a
few
seconds
but
after
that
first
freaky
time
i
was
extremely
careful
with
the
neutralization

i
have
since
read
on
some
forum
that
unlike
the
hcl
salt
dmt
acetate
can
be
isolated
in
crystaline
form
which
would
eliminate
problems
with
over-acidification
but
i
have
not
tried
so
i
cant
confirm
this



once
all
dmt
had
dissolved
a
small
piece
of
a
ciggarette
filter
was
place
in
the
spoon
and
a
perfectly
clear
mixture
was
pulled
into
the
syringe

once
i
had
used
yellow-tinted
dmt
that
had
not
been
recrystallized
and
the
solution
came
out
slightly
yellow
but
if
the
dmt
is
good
it
will
come
out
clear



i
was
otherwise
clean
and
sober

i
dont
remember
eating
anything
yet
that
day

the
sun
was
shining
through
the
window
as
i
had
removed
one
of
the
decidely
southwestern
colored
afgans
i
was
using
as
a
curtain

my
room
is
decorated
with
alex
grey
prints
carpeted
with
material
with
similar
color
schemes
as
my
curtains
and
most
of
the
furniture
is
wood

in
a
sentence
it
is
set
up
to
be
cool
to
trip
in

i
turned
on
a
tool
song
from
the
lateralus
cd
tied
off
and
pushed
in
the
plunger

there
was
no
burn
no
hyperventilating
vinegar
breath
so
there
was
no
appreciable
excess
of
acid

though
the
dose
was
prepared
perfectly
immediately
i
knew
was
in
for
something
i
didnt
expect

sometimes
ive
experienced
and
have
had
others
describe
a
subtle
change
in
hearing
when
smoking
dmt

it
is
like
tinitis
but
not
exactly
audible
just
a
percieved
change
in
frequencies

this
was
the
first
change
in
perception
i
experienced
only
more
pronounced

in
maybe
1
second
after
injection
this
very
audible
whining
started
and
quickly
became
louder

soon
after
the
visuals
started

these
were
unlike
any
dmt
visuals
i
have
had
in
that
there
were
no
patterns

becoming
startled
that
jolt
i
mentioned
earlier
i
bolted
upright
out
of
my
seat
and
looked
around

instead
of
euphoria
i
experienced
apprehension
and
meth
like
stimulation

everything
had
the
look
of
a
water
painting

then
i
noticed
that
i
no
longer
noticed
that
noise
but
could
not
hear
the
music
either

i
could
hear
nothing



now
i
was
becoming
concerned
and
that
manifested
itself
into
the
trip

vision
was
extremely
disorienting
as
nothing
really
made
sense

the
colors
and
objects
of
my
room
were
mostly
meaningless
everything
seemed
to
be
one
fluid
object
that
i
couldnt
focus
on
but
i
was
able
to
recognize
the
chair
i
was
until
moments
ago
sitting
in
calmly

it
moved
from
the
edge
of
my
vision
to
try
to
wrap
around
me
but
i
quickly
turned
away
to
escape
its
ravenous
grasp

ive
had
strange
dillusions
like
this
on
acid
but
dmt
has
always
been
more
of
visual
trip
without
too
much
insane
thinking

realizing
this
in
a
moment
of
clarity
i
became
less
frightened
of
the
gathering
forces
of
furniture
preparing
for
attack
and
more
frightened
of
the
possibility
that
i
had
done
something
incredibly
stupid
today
i
believe
that
injecting
dmt
is
pretty
stupid
but
im
glad
i
got
to
experience
it



as
the
increasing
visual
chaos
and
apparent
deafness
became
almost
too
much
to
bear
the
strangest
thing
happened

fade
to
white

my
entire
field
of
vision
just
faded
to
white

i
was
standing
up
in
the
middle
of
my
room
with
music
playing
blind
and
deaf

i
know
i
moved
my
head
around
to
see
if
that
would
help
but
it
didnt

i
could
feel
a
presences
but
could
not
see
or
hear
any
one/thing

pessimistic
i
was
sure
my
roommate
had
come
in
and
saw
me
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
music
playing
staring
blindly
and
unable
to
hear
or
respond

i
thought
the
chair
had
consumed
me

i
thought
i
had
caused
myself
permanent
brain
damage

i
thought
i
had
died

time
had
no
meaning
so
i
dont
know
how
long
this
lasted
but
it
did
finally
fade
back
to
reality

the
trip
took
a
more
normal
direction
but
i
was
still
rattled

the
final
effects
faded
45
minutes
after
injection

just
in
time
to
get
to
school

having
survived
the
ordeal
i
was
very
excited

i
called
a
friend
and
described
the
experience

he
said
in
so
many
words
that
i
had
lost
my
fucking
mind
doing
something
like
that

later
i
tried
to
find
cases
of
acidosis
that
had
similar
symptoms
but
could
find
nothing

i
have
to
conclude
that
these
strange
occurences
are
from
a
massive
dose
of
dmt

all
in
all
this
was
the
most
frightening
experince
ive
ever
had
including
opiate
overdose
a
bad
reaction
mixing
maois
with
mdma
accidently
being
robbed
at
gunpoint
et
cetera



i
submit
this
experience
not
only
to
add
to
the
available
information
on
dmt
preparations
and
trips
but
so
others
might
decide
that
iv
isnt
really
the
route
to
take

injecting
a
chemical
of
often
questionable
purity
mixed
with
vinegar
directly
into
the
vein
is
reckless

i
was
careful
my
dmt
was
the
purest
i
or
anyone
i
know
has
ever
seen
my
gaa
is
about
as
pure
as
it
gets
ph
was
as
close
to
7
as
possible
but
looking
back
i
realize
how
reckless
that
really
was

a
normal
iv
dose
has
effects
almost
indistinguishable
from
that
of
a
normal
smoked
dose
so
why
bother




my
first
dmt
trip
was
so
intense
i
will
try
to
describe
what
i
experienced
as
well
as
i
can
searching
the
dmt
forums
reading
trip
reports
and
hearing
stories
first
hand
from
good
friends
still
could
have
never
prepared
me
for
what
that
15
minutes
of

included

i
would
like
to
describe
a
little
background
about
myself
im
22
years
old
live
in
southern
california
have
a
great
job
and
through
years
of
life
experiences
decided
that
my
time
on
this
earth
is
to
be
spent
expanding
my
body
physically
and
mentally
my
right
hand
man
is
lysergic
my
best
memories
and
trips
have
been
on
l
my
most
coveted
of
the
covets
mdma
following
close
second
and
a
grand
list
of
others
ill
try
my
best

a
few
months
ago
while
building
our
arsenal
of
funnystuffs
for
burning
man
our
dude
had
some
dmt
my
trip
buddy
and
i
had
heard
about
this
substance
had
never
tried
but
were
vary
curious
it
was
pretty
expensive
so
we
passed
it
up
and
went
to
burning
man
which
by
the
way
was
epic
great
lsd
the
biggest
mdma
wafers
i
have
seen
and
one
of
the
best
space
cadet
climates
you
can
find

2
days
ago
one
of
my
good
friends
came
over
to
my
house
pipe
in
hand
i
was
taking
a
nap
while
my
trip
buddy
was
playing
some
halo
our
buddy
came
in
with
his
pipe
and
i
got
excited
to
burn
down
some
great
cannabis
my
friend
then
told
me
that
he
had
a
pipe
that
he
and
his
friend
were
hitting
dmt
out
of
some
of
it
melted
and
there
may
be
a
little
something
something
left
for
us
to
hit
might
get
you
high
he
exclaims
now
i
am
self
instructed
space
cadet
i
will
take
that
strip
of
acid
i
will
eat
that
funky
looking
shroom
ill
jump
on
the
train
and
shoot
mdma

the
point
by
the
time
we
heard
dm
my
trip
buddy
and
i
were
ready
our
friend
helped
us
turn
down
the
shades
and
turn
down
the
music
smoked
a
bowl
and
got
ready
he
told
us
the
pipe
had
remnants
of
a
sesh
earlier
and
to
hit
it
like
a
resin
bowl

my
trip
buddy
was
adamant
on
taking
the
first
hit
i
really
did
owe
it
to
him
while
at
bman
we
didnt
sync
up
as
much
as
we
wouldve
liked
to
the
room
was
dark
and
only
the
ambient
sound
of
the
xbox
fan
could
be
heard
we
say
our
goodbyes
and
as
is
life
our
little
drugbrother
oath
and
he
takes
a
niice
puff
the
smell
of
plastic
quickly
filled
the
air
he
held
his
breath
deep
and
passed
the
pipe
to
our
buddy
who
promptly
passed
it
to
me
i
held
the
pipe
to
my
mouth
started
to
light
up
and
glanced
at
my
buddy
who
was
obviously
on
his
merry
way
the
next
15
minute
trip
was
both
the
most
scared
i
have
ever
been
in
my
life
and
also
a
feeling
so
foreign
to
me
and
more
than
could
have
ever
perceived

i
started
taking
a
pretty
aggressive
hit
from
the
pipe
thinking
in
my
head
to
take
a
bigger
rip
as
it
was
supposedly
not
a
full
dose
and
why
the
fuck
not
i
think
because
my
friend
had
hit
it
first
and
it
was
like
a
resin
hit
that
he
had
heated
the
resin
up
enuff
for
me
to
get
a
goooood
hit
the
toke
i
took
had
a
very
plastic
taste
and
smell
to
it
and
while
trying
to
hit
a
little
more
i
let
out
a
closed
mouth
stoner
cough
that
blew
out
most
of
my
toke
my
stoner
mind
kicks
in
its
still
up
to
your
lips
hit
the
damn
thing
again
and
i
did


now
i
have
heard
people
tell
me
about
things
coming
on
quick
never
in
my
life
have
i
been
hit
that
quickly
before
i
was
even
done
lighting
my
toke
the
effects
started
to
take
place
after
my
toke
i
held
in
my
breath
and
said
holy
fuck
im
tripping
before
muttering
that
full
thought
i
was
fully
integrated
i
leaned
back
into
my
seated
position
on
the
couch
staring
straight
at
our
living
room
wall
the
first
noticeable
change
was
like
the
worlds
most
technical
bandanna
being
turned
to
smoke
by
a

magician
but
faster


once
the
bandanna
print
went
away
i
had
maybe
3
seconds
of
thought
i
looked
straight
ahead
at
the
wall
it
looked
as
if
i
was
leaning
my
head
from
left
to
right
then
the
image
became
stable
and
clear
very
clear
the
image
i
saw
before
my
eyes
just
of
my
living
room
wall
with
fireplace
and
shelves
was
crystal
clear
fucking
clear
no
imperfections
left
right
bottom
to
top
perfect
then
the
image
stabilized
and
started
to
fractal
and
appear
to
drop
back
every
2
inches
while
shrinking
in
dimension
by
about
2
i
watched
as
the
fractals
got
smaller
and
smaller
then
i
my
good
reader
went
unconscious
thats
right
total
knock
out
cold
so
far
knocked
out
my
friends
later
told
me
i
was
snoring
loudly
as
if
i
were
in
deeeeeep
sleep
i
had
never
been
knocked
out
cold
nor
did
i
ever
perceive
it
while
in
the
trip



after
going
unconscious
i
went
further
in
time
and
space
and
matter
little
and
big
and
everything
all
at
once
friend
i
went
on
a
journey
i
felt
as
if
i
was
being
rocked
straight
through
a
vast
expanse
at
first
the
expanse
was
filled
with
what
i
can
only
think
of
now
after
as
my
life
or
memories
of
it
flashing
before
me
i
distinctly
remember
hands
all
sizes
races
religions
ethnics
time
periods
just
hands
no
faces
all
grabbing
for
my
body
or
whatever
i
was
made
up
of
for
this
travel
i
have
no
control
over
any
motor
skills
and
it
has
only
been
about
a
mere
45seconds
i
am
traveling
very
fast
faster
than
any
one
man
could
perceive

the
hands
fade
away
and
the
vivid
fast
moving
memories
stop
i
now
feel
100%
out
of
body
or
mind
whichever
you
prefer
like
i
am
lying
on
my
back
in
the
deepest
black
in
the
ocean
i
feel
as
if
i
have
traveled
to
the
end
i
am
not
spiritual
i
am
very
learned
but
do
not
believe
in
god
or
any
diety
other
than
ones
body
and
mind
but
the
place
that
i
went
to
felt
as
if
this
was
the
end
of
all
things
be
it
god
the
end
of
time
the
beggining
of
time
the
only
words
i
like
to
use
out
loud
are
zero
i
reached
a
point
of
complete
zero
this
place
to
this
very
second
still
chills
me
i
was
so
far
into
this
place
into
my
own
mind
or
out
of
it
that
i
was
scared

i
started
thinking
very
hard
but
it
was
not
forming
with
normal
braincells
i
usually
use
to
comprehend
i
was
comprehending
on
an
ultimate
level
i
then
started
to
hear
2
voices
the
feeling
on
my
back
now
started
to
feel
as
if
i
was
in
an
operating
room
but
instead
of
all
white
clean
that
very
very
black
from
earlier
on
my
back
in
black
no
vivid
colors
no
specks
of
light
no
light
tunnels
no
fractals
all
black
each
voice
is
standing
on
either
side
of
me
both
are
actually
myself
speaking

what
is
this

how
is
this
sooo
black

why
have
you
no
thoughts

is
this
the
end
and
forever

then
i
felt
as
if
i
was
underwater
at
the
deepest
point
possible
in
the
ocean
being
pulled
straight
to
the
surface
by
a
very
strong
hand
soooo
fast
it
is
at
this
point
that
i
regain
conscious
still
with
eyes
closed
the
exact
point
i
come
to
i
start
coughing
as
if
i
had
just
been
drowning
i
grabbed
my
friend
next
to
me
with
much
force
and
i
had
no
idea
what
was
happening
i
paniked
they
had
no
idea
i
had
gone
so
far
into
my
mind
and
were
laughing
this
off
my
eyes
had
opened
but
i
still
saw
black
it
took
me
a
few
seconds
to
start
seeing
anything
then
vivid
light
shown
thru
i
still
could
not
think
i
remember
trying
to
think
and
hearing
or
feeling
a
force
shut
me
up
trying
to
take
me
back
to
that
place
of
zero
coming
too
was
pretty
scary
i
had
no
idea
what
i
had
done
not
even
remember
smoking
the
dmt
i
was
very
confused
i
could
not
perceive
what
the
hell
was
going
on
at
all
i
felt
very
alone

i
half
stood
up
and
puked
more
matter
than
i
have
ever
in
my
life
this
puke
was
what
i
believe
to
be
of
epic
maybe
spiritual
proportions
my
trip
buddy
who
had
already
come
out
of
his
trip
more
fractals
and
being
able
to
think
than
total
fucking
recall
like
myself
was
trying
to
rush
me
out
the
back
door
to
puke
all
the
while
he
thinks
i
am
overexaggerating
i
wish
i
could
not
walk
my
body
felt
very
heavy
immobile
i
am
now
able
to
form
thoughts
first
thing
in
my
head
what
did
i
eat
i
thought
that
i
had
eaten
a
bad
shroom
or
a
million
hits
of
acid
or
too
many
grams
of
mdma
man
i
was
fucking
confused
my
friend
was
half
carrying
me
and
once
outside
the
back
door
set
me
loose

i
still
could
not
walk
i
fumbled
down
2
stairs
off
the
back
patio
and
on
to
the
grass
of
the
backyard
sounds
were
very
mechanical
scary
stuff
i
fell
onto
my
hands
and
knees
i
had
no
idea
where
i
was
then
i
saw
a
tree
it
was
the
only
thing
that
was
familiar
so
i
crawled
for
it
reaching
for
it
it
felt
as
if
i
was
a
leper
crawling
for
a
blessing
from
christ
as
i
crawled
the
wild
fractalization
started
taking
effect
i
crawled
as
if
i
was
on
a
treadmill
never
ending
this
was
in
a
matter
of
seconds
but
if
felt
as
i
was
crawling
forever
knowing
the
tree
would
be
out
of
reach
i
gave
up
and
fell
onto
my
stomach
i
thought
to
myself
i
am
dead
this
is
what
the
end
is
like
this
is
what
happens
when
you
overdose
im
fucking
dying

now
my
friends
the
blessings
the
visual

while
preparing
to
die
i
could
slowly
start
remember
what
was
going
on
i
knew
my
friend
had
come
over
looping
some
things
that
happened
each
time
skipping
that
fatal
toke
then
from
nowhere
it
hits
me
like
a
fact
sheet
i
smoked
dmt
i
have
about
15
minutes
at
this
point
i
stopped
panicking
and
had
the
most
amazing
visuals
now
i
have
seen
many
many
visuals
lsd
mushrooms
mdma
all
at
once
even
i
am
sure
and
will
take
it
to
the
grave
that
i
had
not
seen
a
fractal
or
had
a
visual
until
dmt
the
visuals
i
saw
were
on
a
much
higher
level
than
acid
or
shrooms
it
felt
like
every
trip
i
ever
had
times
5
million
divided
by
6
times
50
billion
full
colors
fractals
coming
on
switching
quickly
like
ink
falling
into
a
glass
of
water
my
mind
focused
on
3
blades
of
grass
and
repeated
this
throughout
the
backyard
no
monsters
bears
sharks
or
boogeymen
these
visuals
were
spot
on
like
so
spot
on
if
i
died
that
moment
my
life
goal
for
the
ultimate
of
ultimates
had
been
achieved


i
flip
over
to
my
back
noticing
that
i
had
made
it
to
the
tree
thoughts
started
to
slowly
come
back
to
my
own
grasp
i
was
calm
and
knew
that
trying
to
fight
would
make
it
worse
so
i
lay
there
scared
but
in
the
know
my
friend
dropped
me
a
pillow
and
walked
away
i
wanted
to
use
it
but
could
not
muster
up
the
strength
i
sat
up
to
try
to
gather
my
bearings
the
light
was
very
intense
so
i
lay
down
another
time
about
10
minutes
later
the
trip
is
over
mild
breathing
of
surfaces
should
let
you
know
i
have
been
known
to
always
see
things
breathing
its
pretty
gnarly
dang
lsd



i
walked
inside
to
see
my
homies
they
were
laughing
at
what
had
happened
i
told
them
what
had
happened
and
the
mood
quickly
changed
i
truly
went
further
than
any
of
us
had
anticipated
my
friend
only
had
a
little
fractals
and
visuals
like
i
said
earlier
it
may
be
due
to
him
heating
it
up
with
his
first
hit
or
me
taking
2
rips
all
in
all
it
was
a
wild
experience
i
had
a
really
bad
feeling
the
rest
of
the
day
i
was
scared
of
the
dark
that
night
and
just
thinking
about
the
trip
got
me
pretty
scared
my
friend
says
i
reached
nirvana
i
saw
i
went
to
zero
wherever
i
went
it
made
me
swear
off
dmt
only
to
be
back
a
few
minutes
later
this
time
with
a
little
hit
and
the
window
melted
no
problems




this
is
mostly
a
second
hand
account
which
is
not
ideal
but
its
a
result
of
my
girlfriends
lack
of
time
busy
student
and
lack
of
dedication
towards
documenting
her
trips

it
drives
me
nuts
but
i
am
a
relentless
drug
geek
and
like
to
document
everything

as
a
consequence
im
offering
up
this
mixed
account
because
i
think
it
provides
some
unusual
data
for
consideration

some
background

a
few
weeks
ago
i
had
an
incredibly
strong
and
profound
experience
via
50
mg
of
dmt
rendered
orally
active
with
3
g
of
ground
syrian
rue
seeds
report
id
58800

my
girlfriend
was
eager
to
repeat
the
experiment
for
herself
at
a
lower
dose
because
i
had
my
ass
kicked
royally
and
tried
3
g
of
syrian
rue
seeds
and
approximately
30
mg
of
dmt
as
it
turns
out
the
combination
made
her
very
sick
and
she
spend
most
of
the
experience
in
bed
throwing
up
with
only
very
minor
psychedelic
effects

not
giving
up
she
tried
the
experiment
again
yesterday
as
follows

0000


dosed
1
g
syrian
rue
10x
extract
hoping
for
a
cleaner
effect
0040


no
significant
effects
noted
added
one
gram
ground
syrian
rue
seeds
0100


dosed
37
mg
of
powdered
dmt
crystals
0120


resting
peacefully
on
sofa
0155


puked
revealing
undigested
syrian
rue
0210


feeling
significant
body
load
difficulty
walking
but
no
psychedelic
effects
0300


still
very
sick
no
psychedelic
effects

puked
again
0320


sickness
seems
to
be
abating
just
had
a
cup
of
soup

it
was
at
this
point
which
should
have
coincided
roughly
with
the
peak
experience
due
to
the
sheer
disappointment
over
another
uneventful
experiment
i
suggested
she
try
smoking
some
dmt
she
readily
agreed
so
i
measured
up
25
mg
and
assisted
her
with
the
pipe

what
occurred
next
was
interesting
indeed
my
notes

0330

-
smoked
approximately
25
mg
of
dmt
and
laid
back
on
the
sofa
0340

-
only
vaguely
responsive
to
my
prompts
other
than
moaning
facial
twitching
0350

-
no
noticeable
changes
barely
conscious
minor
body
movement
0405

-
no
noticeable
changes
very
unresponsive
just
moaning
breathing
0420

-
still
very
difficult
to
talk
just
beginning
to
come
out
of
it
0430

-
able
to
communicate
once
again
but
still
feeling
a
strong
body
stone

what
one
may
notice
here
is
the
inordinately
long
duration
of
effects
i
had
fully
expected
her
to
begin
coming
out
of
the
experience
at
about
the
ten
minute
mark
as
is
common
for
smoked
dmt
but
the
trip
was
fully
captivating
for
almost
a
full
hour

i
was
able
to
coerce
her
into
providing
some
documentation
and
she
conveyed
the
experience
as
follows






\x93this
trip
was
like
being
thrown
into
an
inferno
in
the
deepest
pits
of
hell
and
having
pure
evil
boiled
out
of
me
im
not
talking
simmered

im
talking
about
being
brought
to
a
rapid
rolling
boil
it
was
intense
i
remember
thinking
\x93holy
shit
i
had
no
idea
it
could
be
like
this
but
all
that
could
escape
my
lips
was
a
barely
audible
\x93wow
there
was
a
loud
humming
sound
like
the
sound
of
a
didgeridoo
that
enveloped
me
it
was
absolutely
maddening
at
first
i
thought
it
was
my
boyfriend
who
was
trip
sitting
for
me
but
then
i
realized
that
he
wasnt
making
any
sound
at
all
then
i
thought
it
was
the
music
but
it
didnt
stop
when
the
song
ended

i
couldnt
move
i
couldnt
talk
all
i
could
do
was
moan
and
whine
in
the
hell
that
i
had
created
for
myself
my
rational
mind
had
not
left
me
entirely
i
kept
telling
myself
over
and
over
in
my
head
\x93its
okay
this
too
shall
pass
this
cant
last
forever

and
by
the
way
you
asked
for
this

this
is
what
you
wanted
and
now
youre
getting
it
so
suck
it
up
and
take
it
like
a
warrior
should


summary

when
the
37
mg
of
oral
dmt
failed
to
have
any
psychedelic
effects
i
assumed
the
maoi
had
failed
to
do
its
work
however
surely
the
intensity
and
duration
of
the
subsequent
smoked
dmt
was
potentiated
by
the
maoi

it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
maois
could
effect
a
dose
administered
by
smoking
but
it
seems
probable
that
this
occurred
i
would
love
to
have
more
data
on
the
phenomena
but
am
unable
to
find
any
i
hope
this
report
provides
useful
to
others
in
the
least
it
only
reinforces
the
notion
that
one
should
use
great
care
when
working
with
maois




i
was
foolish
id
just
acquired
some
dmt
and
was
impatient
to
try
it
i
didnt
know
for
sure
the
purity
of
the
substance
i
had
acquired
and
instead
of
properly
weighing
a
dose
i
found
i
didnt
have
sensitive
enough
scales
i
just
tried
to
eyeball
it

i
was
at
home
in
my
apartment
a
safe
and
comfortable
setting
but
i
had
had
a
difficult
week
was
tired
and
not
in
the
most
positive
frame
of
mind
i
really
should
have
waited
until
another
time
i
really
should
have
known
better

i
took
the
dmt
by
sandwiching
it
between
two
layers
of
dried
mint
leaves
in
the
bowl
of
a
glass
bong
filling
the
bong
with
smoke
and
taking
it
in
one
single
hit
which
i
held
in
as
long
as
i
was
able
to

ive
read
the
following
back
to
myself
a
couple
of
times
and
it
doesnt
really
come
close
to
describing
what
this
experience
was
actually
like
or
how
utterly
overwhelming
the
feelings
or
terror
and
dread
were
there
are
huge
bits
missing
because
i
just
dont
know
how
to
describe
them
or
quite
where
they
fit
in
but
its
the
best
i
can
do

i
lay
back
on
my
couch
waiting
for
something
to
happen
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
had
failed
to
get
a
strong
enough
dose
to
experience
anything
but
very
shortly
i
felt
a
warm
glowy
feeling
and
started
to
perceive
some
interesting
fractal-type
visuals
however
i
was
still
very
much
in
what
i
normally
think
of
as
reality
at
this
point



just
as
i
began
to
think
that
this
was
as
far
as
this
experience
would
go
things
changed
suddenly
and
drastically

first
i
felt
my
body
instantaneously
and
completely
disintegrate
into
an
unknowable
number
of
infinitesimally
small
particles
then
the
walls
of
the
room
i
was
in
rapidly
expanded
and
blasted
away
i
knew
i
had
broken
through
i
felt
excited
happy
and
euphoric

i
knew
i
had
broken
through
i
felt
excited
happy
and
euphoric



this
did
not
last

as
the
walls
of
my
room
vanished
away
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
and
was
briefly
inside
of
a
vast
purple
coloured
dome-like
structure
covered
in
fractal
patterns
it
felt
like
a
beautiful
and
safe
if
somewhat
overwhelming
place
to
be
for
some
reason
i
tried
to
speak
i
dont
recall
what
i
wanted
to
say
but
remember
saying
cup
and
being
confused
that
this
was
not
the
word
i
intended
and
i
was
instantly
ripped
away
from
it
looking
back
there
was
a
clear
sense
that
my
being
torn
away
was
a
direct
result
of
my
attempting
to
speak
although
i
didnt
acknowledge
this
at
the
time

im
not
able
to
clearly
recall
what
the
place
i
found
myself
in
after
that
was
likei
remember
very
briefly
seeing
the
wall
of
my
room
again
before
a
vertical
white
plane
covered
with
a
regular
pattern
of
clearly
defined
black
dots
slammed
across
in
front
of
it
from
one
side
then
from
the
other
side
and
then
closed
in
on
mewhat
little
visual
experience
i
had
after
that
was
incomprehensible
and
indescribable
i
remember
seeing
the
dot
planes
a
few
more
times
and
know
that
i
experienced
other
things
in
between
seeing
those
but
am
unable
to
recall
those
things
in
any
meaningful
way

throughout
all
of
this
there
was
an
overwhelmingly
loud
sound
which
continually
got
louder

i
remember
experiencing
complete
terror
and
feeling
that
this
was
not
at
all
the
right
place
for
me
to
be
that
something
was
very
very
wrong
and
that
i
had
made
an
awful
mistake
in
taking
this
journey
i
believed
with
no
doubt
at
all
that
i
had
died

i
remember
feeling
that
there
was
some
kind
of
consciousness
or
entity
in
that
place
although
i
never
saw
it
which
it
seemed
had
pulled
me
there
and
wished
to
keep
me
there
it
wasnt
exactly
malevolent
but
it
seemed
to
be
enjoying
or
benefiting
from
my
fear
in
some
way

at
this
point
i
began
to
quickly
forget
how
i
had
come
to
this
place
then
who
i
was
then
what
concepts
like
who
i
and
where
even
were
until
i
no
longer
existed

the
thing
that
used
to
be
me
kept
trying
to
speak
although
it
had
no
concept
of
what
speech
or
language
were
or
what
it
was
trying
to
do
or
why
the
other
entity
in
this
place
seemed
to
be
trying
to
devour
and
subsume
the
non-me
into
itself

at
this
point
i
remember
non-me
feeling
only
two
things
complete
dreadful
all-consuming
terror
and
a
desperate
desire
to
grasp
hold
of
some
kind
of
idea
of
what
i
now
know
as
but
was
completely
alien
at
the
time
self

for
what
was
an
unknowable
amount
of
time
at
once
seeming
like
mere
moments
and
at
once
an
eternity
non-me
struggled
to
grab
a
hold
of
an
idea
it
did
not
understand
this
was
inscrutably
difficult
initially
non-me
couldnt
even
conceive
of
what
an
idea
was
never
mind
develop
a
specific
one
but
eventually
after
what
felt
like
an
eternity
of
desperate
mental
grasping
non-me
was
finally
able
with
great
effort
to
say
a
single
word


i

i

i

i

i
dont
know
how
many
times
non-me
said
this
before
progressing
to
i
am
but
it
seemed
uncountably
huge

i
am

i
am

i
am

this
went
on
for
a
long
long
while
my
sense
of
self
slowly
returning
the
entity
if
there
was
such
a
thing
did
not
seem
to
wish
me
to
leave
but
also
no
longer
appeared
interested
in
trying
to
stop
me

a
rectangle
appeared
and
resolved
into
a
calendar
on
my
wall
other
familiar
objects
in
my
apartment
resolved
themselves
one
by
one
i
felt
my
body
again
there
were
walls
a
door
i
was
on
a
couch


however
everything
was
still
distorted
and
i
still
did
not
know
who
or
what
i
was

i
ami
amwent
on
for
some
time
until
suddenly
the
epiphany
came
and
i
recalled
my
name

i
am
a******
j****i
am
a******
j****







i
was
instantly
back
in
reality
and
realised
that
i
was
triumphantly
screaming
this
out
as
loud
as
i
possibly
could

i
felt
confused
and
bewildered
for
some
time
after
that
eventually
i
got
up
to
look
at
my
clock
it
took
me
a
while
to
recall
what
time
was
or
meant
but
once
i
did
i
could
tell
that
this
experience
had
taken
roughly
15
minutes
it
had
felt
like
eternity

the
effects
didnt
fully
wear
off
for
another
half
hour
my
vision
being
distorted
and
my
thoughts
dis-jointed
but
mainly
being
im
never
fucking
doing
that
again

i
felt
confused
and
anxious
for
hours
afterwards
and
barely
slept
that
night

ultimately
though
despite
being
horrible
and
not
something
i
wish
to
repeat
i
think
this
has
been
a
positive
experience
the
main
thing
i
have
taken
from
this
is
a
very
strong
sense
of
my
own
mortality

the
main
thing
i
have
taken
from
this
is
a
very
strong
sense
of
my
own
mortality

and
of
how
unaware
i
was
of
it
before
despite
thinking
otherwise
and
also
a
renewed
feeling
of
how
fortunate
i
am
to
have
this
existence
of
who
i
am
and
of
how
glad
i
am
to
be
who
i
am
ive
been
taught
a
hard
harsh
lesson
and
already
have
a
strong
sense
that
i
will
grow
from
it

i
cant
categorically
say
that
this
will
be
my
last
visit
to
hyperspaceim
deeply
intrigued
by
the
dome-place
i
briefly
saw
before
being
taken
away
towhatever
that
was
but
i
think
that
it
will
be
a
great
many
years
before
i
feel
mentally
grounded
enough
to
venture
there
safely
if
i
ever
do
while
im
glad
of
what
i
experienced
last
night
i
do
not
ever
want
to
go
to
thatplaceagain




this
was
written
three
days
after
this
experience

i
had
an
experience
with
my
friend
dimitri
on
that
burned
me
horribly

it
may
have
put
me
off
of
brain
science
for
the
rest
of
my
life

i
was
at
a
friends
house
on
a
friday
with
about
8
people

we
were
projecting
trippy
stuff
and
the
light
was
low

someone
pulled
out
some
dmt

i
had
never
tried
it
and
thought
why
not

the
pipe
which
had
been
used
before
-
maybe
some
left
in
the
pipe
was
held
to
my
lips
directly
heated
and
i
was
told
to
breath
in
breath
in
breath
in
breath
in

and
then
my
brain
started
screaming

the
experience
itself
was
as
if
someone
crosswired
my
5
senses
and
put
my
brain
into
an
infinite
feedback
loop
imagine
audio
feedback
applied
to
your
crossed
senses
there
were
no
elves

there
was
no
darkmatter
there
was
no
room
people
chair
or
anything
but
my
mind
looking
at
itself
looking
at
itself
looking
at
itself

this
was
not
an
emotional
metaphor
by
the
way

this
was
my
physical
kinesthetic
reality
being
brutally
ripped
from
me

i
had
a
concept
there
were
no
thoughts
that
5
minutes
of
this
would
melt
my
brain
and
i
would
die

and
i
realized
that
death
would
no
save
me
but
i
would
be
like
this
til
the
end
of
the
universe

it
was
the
most
terrifying
horrifying
experience
i
have
had
or
could
imagine
having

when
i
came
too
i
was
told
that
i
had
screamed
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
for
three
minutes

i
had
bitten
my
hand
so
hard
that
i
had
broken
through
the
skin
in
10
points
damaged
a
nerve
in
my
pinky
and
my
tooth
was
loose
i
had
given
myself
a
black
eye
scratched
my
face
one
eyeball
and
both
my
eyelids

my
left
ankle
and
right
ribs
hurt

my
throat
was
sore

and
i
promptly
got
a
cold
the
next
day
okay
maybe
the
last
one
was
my
own
fault

i
forgot
the
experience
directly
afterwards
and
it
took
my
brain
a
couple
of
days
to
fill
in
the
gaps

though
i
still
do
not
remember
hurting
myself
or
screaming

someone
asked
me
directly
after
i
did
it
if
it
was
bad
and
i
said
no

this
was
patently
false
but
it
took
me
another
day
to
realize
it
unfortunately
this
has
come
in
form
of
reliving
the
experience
in
horrific
dreams
that
leave
me
terrified
shivering
and
seeing
things
after
i
wake
up

just
as
you
being
drunk
feels
like
being
drunk
these
dreams
feel
like
being
on
dmt
they
really
feel
the
same
because
of
the
4
am
adrenalin
rushes
i
wake
up
in
the
morning
weak
and
exhausted
with
low
blood
sugar
the
cold
hasnt
helped

saturday
was
a
wash

i
actually
got
up
and
gave
a
talk
to
high
school
students
about
interactive
art

i
then
forgot
that
i
gave
the
talk
for
the
rest
of
the
day

i
ended
up
feeling
as
if
id
dreamt
the
whole
day

sunday
was
better
but
still
very
difficult

i
have
developed
hopefully
temporarily
a
fear
of
the
dark
which
i
think
is
related
to
the
resulting
nightmares

each
day
it
has
taken
me
half
the
day
to
shed
the
anxiety
of
the
night

i
love
reality

i
have
visited
the
alternative
and
for
the
time
being
i
am
staying
right
here

my
brain
feels
raw
and
the
aftertaste
of
the
terror
and
horror
that
i
felt
has
made
it
difficult
to
function
even
when
awake

i
just
keep
saying
to
myself
it
was
only
a
dream
until
i
believe
it

ive
been
taking
it
easy

i
didnt
work
this
weekend

i
went
to
the
sea
shore
a
spa
and
buddhist
meditation

it
has
helped

the
lessons
-do
this
shit
in
the
right
setting

really
think
about
it

among
other
things
i
should
have
been
sitting
on
the
floor

think
about
how
stressed
you
are
and
how
you
feel

-*always*
specify
how
much
you
want

always
ask
how
much
the
other
person
wants

i
think
a
lot
of
this
was
due
to
the
amount
i
was
a
first
timer
as
well
and
some
things
one
should
work
up
to

-intervene

if
you
dont
see
the
above
things
happening
stop
the
proceedings

-intervene
no
one
could
know
i
was
biting
myself
but
someone
should
have
checked

i
was
restrained
but
i
probably
should
have
been
earlier

i
was
lucky
that
i
didnt
damage
myself
worse

i
know
that
people
work
through
things
and
that
might
be
natural
but
better
safe
than
sorry

seriously

-think

this
is
not
a
toy

do
you
want
to
take
this
risk
for
me
there
were
no
doors
opening

and
while
i
learned
a
few
things
they
were
not
quite
what
people
mean
about
when
they
talk
about
learning
about
yourself

thats
about
it

it
is
now
three
days
later
and
i
am
getting
better

i
think
ive
had
the
worst
of
the
dreams
and
while
i
know
theyll
continue
for
a
while
im
hoping
they
will
decrease
in
severity

thanks
for
reading

i
am
writing
this
in
the
hopes
that
no
one
else
goes
through
this

my
boyfriend
asked
me
if
the
experience
was
abusive
or
therapeutic
and
i
can
without
a
doubt
answer
abusive

-=-=-=-
addendum
submitted
3
weeks
later
-=-=-=-
two
weeks
later
i
decided
that
maybe
i
would
smoke
some
marijuana
it
was
definitely
a
mistake
it
started
to
go
bad
very
quickly
and
my
heart
started
pounding
and
i
got
extremely
scared
my
body
map
became
distorted
and
i
got
very
disoriented
i
got
up
started
breathing
slowly
and
walked
around
i
told
my
friends
what
was
happening
and
they
helped
distract
me
and
eventually
it
got
more
bearable

unfortunately
it
also
brought
back
the
nightmares
and
middle-of-the-night
hallucinations
for
the
next
three
days

i
have
never
had
a
problem
with
pot
in
the
past
and
this
was
my
weed
that
i
have
smoked
many
times
before
i
dont
know
if
this
was
a
flashback
of
sorts
or
just
my
serotonin
system
saying
fuck
you
but
it
looks
like
i
am
going
to
have
to
lay
off
of
anything
but
beer
1
beer
for
a
while




prologue
i
have
always
been
reluctant
to
write
down
and

publish
submit
an
experience
like
this
due
to
two
reasons
firstly
because
i
don´t
feel
very
comfortable
expressing
something
which
is
so
personal
and
secondly
because
in
my
opinion
the
perception
is
so
disorganised
or
more
precisely
so
differently
organised
from
the
one
i
have
during
the
usual
experience
that
the
writing
of
the
sensations
feelings
and
thoughts
i
have
in
a
strong
psychedelic
experience
is
usually
quite
inaccurate
and
not
very
precise

however
i
have
had
recently
two
trips
that
had
been
considerably
more
important
than
the
rest
and
they
are
so
stunning
that
i
think
it
could
be
nice
to
write
down
something
about
them
although
this
writing
is
short
imprecise
incomplete
and
inaccurate


even
though
both
trips
are
independent
and
can
be
read
separately
it
is
interesting
how
they
show
in
some
way
very
different
facets
of
the
psychedelic
experience
although
they
have
lots
of
things
in
common
too

the
first
trip
is
probably
the
most
powerful
experience
of
my
life
and

the
second
one

is
probably
the
best
and
most
beautiful
experience
of
my
life


so
after
this
introduction
lets
move
to
the
matter
of
this
experience
report
the
first
trip
---------

personal
background
i
am
a
quite
experienced
psychedelic
user
even
doing
psychedelics
almost
daily
or
very
regularly
in
some
periods
previous
to
this
trip
i
had
had
lots
of
experiences
specially
quite
a
lot
of
dmt
ones
including
strong
breakthroughs
i
had
also
experimented
with
trips
and
substances
in
different
contexts
and
settings


on
the
other
side
it
is
also
important
to
know
that
my
main
interest
in
life
is
geometry
also
other
parts
of
maths
in
the
sense
of
understanding
and
visualization
of
beautiful
complicated
stunning
and
new
geometrical
phenomena
related
to
intersections
hypersurfaces
higher
dimensions
etc
i
am
a
string/m-theory
and
algebraic
geometry
researcher
this
intellectual/professional
interest
is
also
my
main
interest
about
the
psychedelic
experience
and
without
it
you
cannot
understand
why
this
concrete
trip
was
so
significative
to
me

as
an
aside
it
is
normal
to
understand
part
of
my
interest
in
dmt
taking
into
account
its
visual
and
geometrical
richness
for
example
quoting
psychonautwiki
\x93the
geometry
present
with
smokeable
dmt
is
considered
by
many
to
be
the
most
profoundly
intricate
and
complex
set
of
visual
geometry
found
within
the
entirety
of
the
psychedelic
experience

setting

i
live
alone
in
my
house
on
this
occasion
i
was
sitting
at
my
desk
with
my
laptop
and
several
monitors
showing
different
images
and
videos
about
geometric
visualizations

i
was
sitting
at
my
desk
with
my
laptop
and
several
monitors
showing
different
images
and
videos
about
geometric
visualizations

there
was
also
some
psychedelic/spatial
music
playing
in
the
beginning
the
lights
of
the
room
were
on
i
felt
quite
nervous
and
i
couldn´t
relax
very
much
unlike
the
majority
of
previous
times
this
turned
to
be
significant
later

dosage
and
pre-trip/first-trip

there
was
a
initial
trip
just
before
the
main
one
so
i´ll
relate
here
separately
i
started
smoking
quite
salvia
in
a
bong
i
can´t
precise
which
quantity
even
though
i
knew
the
exact
quantity
it
wouldn´t
be
very
accurate
due
to
the
following
reason
as
i
didn´t
want
to
breakthrough/dissociate
with
salvia
i
started
smoking
gradually
more
and
more
salvia
but
without
maintaining
it
for
a
long
time
in
my
mouth/lungs
as
a
result
i
was
quite
high
but
quite
conscient
too
although
i
managed
to
do
this
in
a
very
efficient
way
it
was
also
true
that
just
since
the
very
beginning
things
started
to
go
wrong
i
do
not
really
know
why

i
kept
on
remembering
and
thinking
about
a
specific
kind
of
things
i
was
obsessed
and
worried
about
at
that
time
this
strongly
stranged
to
me
because
even
though
some
thoughts/obsessions
are
sometimes
potentiated
in
some
more
or
less
bad
trips
this
particular
kind
of
thoughts
had
always
been
removed
when
i
was
tripping

i
kept
on
smoking
salvia
and
at
some
point
when
the
ferris
wheel
effect
started
to
intensify
i
was
thinking
\x93man
this
is
so
ridiculous
these
stupid
obsessions
are
not
going
to
allow
you
to
trip
imagine
people
saying
\x93xxxx
couldn´t
enjoy

the
amusement
park
of
the
trip
due
to
these
stupid
reasons


after
some
time
i
achieved
to
calm
down
those
obsessions
but
in
a
bad
way
because
i
knew
i
was
lying
to
myself
and
i
took
the
first
gvg
pipe
loaded
with
40
mg
of
dmt
i
smoked
it
but
not
perfectly
i
think
i
didn´t
manage
to
maintain
it
for
a
long
time/i
didn´t
smoke
the
pipe
completely

and
then
man
i
should
had
realized
that
something
was
not
normal
i
mean
it
is
difficult
to
realize
that
when
you
are
high
on
salvia
and
dmt
but
anyway
for
example
i
should
have
understood
it
when
the
song
i
was
listening
mixed
with
the
3d-spiral/tunnel
of
the
video
i
was
watching
and
a
kind
of
coloured
3d-whirlwind
come
to
me
but
mixing
all
music
visuals
thoughts
i
mean
lot
of
elements
sounds
visuals
thoughts
patterns
colours
feelings
seemed
to
come
to
me
in
a
whirlwind
but
in
a
kind
of
hypersynesthesic
way
ideas
or
relations
came
to
me
almost
spatially
like
all
other
elements
of
vision
in
a
completely
disorganised/mixed
perception
that
was
fucking
crazy

anyway
the
case
is
that
i
was
quite
high
but
still
quite
conscient
and
i
still
hadn´t
[had
a]
breakthrough
either
so
i
said
\x93let´s
smoke
the
other
pipe
but
this
time
in
a
proper
way
so
i
walk
to
the
bathroom
because
it
was
dark
and
i
could
see
the
flame
clearly
and
i
torch
the
flame
to
the
gvg
pipe
with
around
another
40
mg
of
dmt
and
i
did
it
perfectly
a
huge
white
column
of
smoke
appeared
and
i
swallowed
it
completely
i
walk
to
my
room
again
the
light
was
now
off
although
there
was
a
certain
illumination
coming
from
the
different
pc
monitors
i
stood
in
front
of
the
bed
and
i
held
the
smoke
i
did
it
perfectly
i
almost
swallowed
it
but
i
managed
to
keep
it
in
my
mouth/lungs
for
a
huge
period
of
time
my
intention
was
to
lie
down
in
my
bed
i
don´t
even
know
if
i
managed
to
do
it
because
just
a
few
moments
after
smoking
that
pipe
the
main
thing
irrumpted
in
a
brutal
way

the
main
thing
even
today
i
cannot
understand
what
happened
then
it
was
such
a
crazy
terrible
brutally
powerful
thing
that
i
cannot
understand
why
that
happened
i
had
always
wondered
about
that
kind
of
lovecrafts
idea
why
necessarily
to
enter
in
a
completely
different
plane
of
reality
has
to
cause
terror
i
had
already
had
several
experiences
like
that
both
of
positive
neutral
and
bad
and
even
at
this
point
i
didn´t
have
a
clear
idea
about
that

i
penetrated
completely
and
stayed
in
the
hyperspace
it
was
a
brutal
tremendous
breakthrough
i
would
say
that
it
was
my
strongest
breakthrough
ever
i
was
completely
inside
some
kind
of
hyperreality

it
is
quite
useless
to
describe
it
some
of
the
elements
of
my
room
stayed
there
but
anyway
it
was
another
world
another
reality

a
common
effect
in
my
experience
in
lots
of
breakthroughs
with
dmt
which
can
help
to
describe
the
scene
is
that
all
the
reality
becomes
denser*
all
the
colours
and
things
become
more
powerful
and
brighter
than
ever
saturated
and
the
space
itself
becomes
denser
like
more
things
happening
and
more
shapes
colours
images
being
perceived
at
the
same
time
than
in
the
usual
world
and
perception
as
icome
back
to
reality
i
cannot
avoid
the
sensation
that
that
was
the
real
reality


in
this
concrete
trip
that
sensation
was
brutally
crazy
overwhelmingly
strong
the
scene
was
hyper-powerful
and
dense
and
instantly
i
fell
into
a
brutally
deep
profound
horror
it
seemed
that
i
had
arrived
to
that
place
it
was
obvious
that
i
was
dead
or
at
least
that
my
normal
life
and
world
had
finished
abruptly
i
felt
alone
conscient
of
all
my
familiars
and
friends
werent
there
i
was
alone
caught
imprisoned
in
that
world
i
also
felt
the
presence
of
the
beings
but
these
weren´t
kind
beings
like
in
other
dmt
trips
these
were
also
superhumans
but
in
the
sense
of
lovecrafts
tales
they
were
completely
above
humans
cruel
to
our
eyes
and
i
was
there
to
be
tortured
by
them
or
caught
by
them
at
their
will
like
a
toy
for
them

one
of
the
strongest
thoughts
i
remember
which
also
crystalized
in
a
clear
way
when
all
the
thing
ended
was
kind
of
\x93wow
i
have
to
warn
everybody
to
not
to
do
psychedelics
because
this
place
exists
and
its
horrible
and
nobody
should
take
the
risk
to
fall
into
it
i
have
to
tell
everybody
i
have
just
remembered
right
now
those
verses
of
\x93the
number
of
the
beast
\x93this
cant
go
on
i
must
inform
the
law/
can
this
still
be
real
or
some
crazy
dream-this
was
kinda
the
spirit/idea
some
ideas
that
came
after
the
trip
to
inaccurately
describe
that
place
was
a
\x93horror
hyperreality
amusement
park
way
beyond
our
simple
and
little
world
deep
into
a
hyperspace/dimension
where
those
beings
tortured
us
and
play
in
a
cruel
way
with
us

another
thing
i
remember
is
that
the
scene
was
mostly
obscure
but
also
bright
in
some
sense
partly
owing
to
the
\x93all-denser-effect
it
was
illuminated
by
general
strange
lights
there
were
also
other
strong
bright
lights
coming
from
the
images
of
the
monitors
and
i
could
see
all
very
dense
and
clear
and
the
brights
for
example
in
some
contours
of
some
objects
were
sharp
and
powerful/metallic/digital
and
in
an
aggressive
way
as
i
said
at
some
moments
that
reminded
me
of
being
in
a
mechanical-futuristic-horror
amusement
park

a
bit
later
one
idea/feeling
that
i
had
very
few
moments
after
the
crazyness
ended
was
some
sense
of
sadness
and
specially
deception
it
was
like
\x93ok
i
have
been
lots
of
times
in
the
hyperspace
and
finally
for
the
most
insane
and
profound
breakthrough
ever
this
is
what
you
have
for
me
to
offer
just
a
crazy
absurd
torture
i
mean
for
the
time
i
was

completely
inside
more
than
ever
before
in
the
very
foundations
of
hyperreality
and
i
only
have
received
this
message
it
was
true
there
had
been
more
interesting
things
in
the
trip
apart
from
that
and
the
trip
itself
had
been
spectacular
and
overwhelming
but
the
overall
message
seemed
a
bit
poor
coming
from
such
ultimate
hyper-dimensional
aliens/beings


however
just
a
month
and
a
half
later
i
would
come
back
to
do
dmt
and
i
ended
up
being
completely
wrong

as
the
other
stunning
trip
would
show

the
substance
had
incredible
beauty
and
positive
things
to
show
me

retrospectively
in
some
sense
i
panicked
when
i
became
aware
that
i
had
fallen
into
another
reality
which
it
is
not
bad
by
itself
but
the
idea
that
all
the
other
things
i
had
lived
werent
real
and
to
appear
into
that
superior
place
turned
out
to
be
quite
terrible
this
sensation
of
being
alone
in
such
a
delicate
situation
and
the
certainty
that
things
had
changed
so
fast
was
probably
a
main
cause
of
the
horror
i
felt

this
sensation
of
being
alone
in
such
a
delicate
situation
and
the
certainty
that
things
had
changed
so
fast
was
probably
a
main
cause
of
the
horror
i
felt


another
cause
specific
to
that
trip
was
that
those
powerful
psychedelics
acted
by
multiplying
to
the
infinite
some
loops
i
had
regarding
the
obsessions
i
was
worried
about
during
the
pre-trip
giving
the
trip
a
quantity
of
unpleasant
cyclic
taste
which
i
think
contributed
to
the
feeling
of
being
imprisoned


although
all
of
this
the
trip
itself
was
indeed
a
bad
trip
but
it
was
not
only
bad
it
had
a
powerful
bad
part
but
it
also
had
a
powerful
neutral
part
in
the
sense
of
falling
into
a
place
which
was
just
overwhelming
because
the
proper
nature
of
being
so
fully
in
that
hyperreality
as
an
aside
the
normal
reality
and
world
was
kind
of
a
naive
and
limited
dream/place
compared
to
that
a
very
little
and
unconscient
room
in
a
enormous
hotel

as
you
can
see
the
word
hyperreality
is
a
main
word
to
describe
this
trip
to
me
in
this
occasion
the
hyperreality
character
of
hyperspace
had
more
prominence
than
the
hyperdimensional
character

this
trip
had
not
such
a
geometrical
character
like
a
lot
of
other
trips
including

the
other
one
i
reported

and
lots
of
others
although
it
certainly
had
several
geometrical
visuals
patterns
repetitions
and
thoughts
but
its
main
characteristic
was
not
a
geometrical
splendour

it
some
sense
it
also
had
a
kind
of
hyperdimensional
character
too
but
in
quite
an
unclear
way
i
wouldn´t
say
that
it
was
hyperdimensional
or
an
illusion
extremely
similar
to
that
like
the
other
trip
mentioned
above
but
it
has
certain
strange
phenomena
regarding
spatiotemporal
perception
maybe
there
were
some
resemblance
to
hyperdimensional
pheneomena
in
the
sense
of
all
was
denser
and
there
were
much
more
things
much
more
relations

for
example
in
lot
of
salvia
trips
i
feel
a
kind
of
ferris
wheel
effect
and
like
an
attraction
to
the
center
of
the
scene
or
to
the
\x93center
of
the
reality
that
makes
me
walk
or
even
think
and
feel
in
circles

in
lot
of
salvia
trips
i
feel
a
kind
of
ferris
wheel
effect
and
like
an
attraction
to
the
center
of
the
scene
or
to
the
\x93center
of
the
reality
that
makes
me
walk
or
even
think
and
feel
in
circles

in
this
occasion
due
to
also
the
dmt
influence
things
became
much
denser
in
the
sense
that
i
perceived
so
many
elements
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
apart
from
the
usual
3
spatial
dimensions
i
kinda
felt
the
usual
time
like
a
spatial
dimension
the
different
3d
scenes
at
different
times
would
be
perceived
kind
of
at
once
similar
to
normal
sections
of
a
4-manifold
3d-scene
x
s^1
in
which
time
was
similar
to
s^1
a
cyclic
circular
dimension
so
time
was
like
a
spatial
thing
but
very
constrained
in
quite
a
bad
way
i
felt
chained
being
tortured
again
and
again--this
contributed
to
the
cyclic
nature
of
time
the
same
things
happened
periodically
however
i
must
say
that
this
description
is
extremely
imprecise
and
i
couldn´t
say
that
i
perceived
time
exactly
like
that
it
also
maintained
a
portion
of
its
time-like
character
so
i
wouldn´t
identify
it
with
a
truly
extra
spatial
dimension
in
the
sense
of
a
independent
additional
direction
this
is
more
like
a
conceptualization
or
analogy
rather
than
a
real
geometrical
perception
of
extra
dimension
i
mean
at
some
times
i
probably
could
say
\x93
no
i
am
not
perceiving
different
3d
scenes
at
the
same
time
it
is
just
my
train
of
thoughts
which
is
very
exhalted
and
hasty
they
are
different
mental
images
of
different
moments
if
you
really
want
to
read
about
a
very
accurate
hyperdimensional
illusion
read
my
other
trip
in
which
i
really
had
a
very
pronounced
impression
of
hyperdimensional
perception
anyway
the
sensation
was
quite
impressive
unclear
and
a
rare
spatiotemporal
distortion
of
perception
and
has
a
reasonable
interest
by
itself

in
a
similar
way
there
were
a
kind
of
extra
time
a
real
time
which
was
more
general
and
ampler
which
identified
with
my
thought
in
a
bird-eye
perspective
this
time
was
as
i
said
more
general
hypertime
and
linear
it
flows
onwards
and
progressed
as
i
was
thinking
in
the
overall
progression
of
the
trip
and
the
events
the
same
thing
i
said
for
the
other
case
applies
for
this
fake
extra
time-like
dimension
in
some
sense
i
could
have
said
that
it
was
really
more
like
a
different
train
of
thoughts
almost
parallel
to
the
rest
of
the
thoughts
but
not
quite
rather
than
a
real
extra
time
dimension

and
finally
as
i
have
said
the
reality
was
kind
of
more
dense
and
as
i
moved
my
arm
or
focused
my
sight
in
different
places
i
perceived
strange
and
unexpected
things
for
example
i
first
looked
to
a
representation
of
a
2d
projection
of
the
12-cube
that
was
displayed
on
a
monitor
and
then
i
turned
my
view
to
another
part
of
the
room
and
that
figure
emerged
in
a
plane
inclined
30-45º
with
respect
to
the
area
i
was
looking
that
was
quite
beautiful
and
impressive
also
the
figure
is
beautiful
by
itself
that
also
suggested
to
me
a
kind
of
extra
dimension
inclined
in
that
strange
way
with
respect
to
the
others
but
again
this
was
also
more
an
exaltation
of
my
thought
rather
than
independent
direction
however
again
it
was
quite
curious
and
strange

*concretely
the
\x93denser
thing
effect
varies
among
different
dmt
trips
when
i
have
a
dmt+salvia
breakthrough
this
effect
is
almost
always
quite
powerful
the
effect
could
be
equally
stronger
with
only
dmt
and
with
other
combinations
too

but
i
would
say
the
frequency
of
the
effect

happening
is
more
common
with
that
concrete
combination
i
would
say

however
that
this
trip
was
mainly
dmt-driven
say
80-75%
dmt
+
20-25%
salvia
i
had
had
different
weights
in
this
mix
and
i
know
how
to
differentiate
them
this
was
a
bit
unpleasant
in
the
sense
that
dmt
has
never
treated
me
so
badly
but
i
want
to
remark
that
probably
the
bad
sensations
present
in
this
trip
were
mostly
originated
by
my
previous
obsessions
rather
than
the
proper
nature
of
these
psychedelics
what
the
psychedelics
did
as
usual
was
multiply
and
potentiate
some
of
these
feelings
and
thoughts

this
trip
was
certainly
a
point
of
inflection
it
was
dreadful
it
was
so
strong
so
so
difficult
to
explain
so
difficult
to
understand
it
supposed
a
very
profound
before
and
an
after
incidentally
it
made
me
want
to
stop
doing
psychedelics
for
a
while
it
is
true
that
i
didn´t
think
to
stop
doing
them
forever
not
even
for
a
long
time
because
among
other
things
i
consider
them
an
interesting
tool
to
explore
some
geometrical
concepts
i
work
with
and
which
i
love
however
i
felt
i
needed
time
to
assimilate
and
integrate
the
experience
and
i
did
not
feel
like
tripping
again
in
the
days
after


another
consequence
is
that
it
reinforced
and
stressed
the
idea
that
i
need
to
clarify
my
mind
and
overcome
certain
obsessions
in
order
to
exploit
the
trips
i
already
knew
that
the
mental
state
is
important
when
you
are
using
any
psychoative
substance
and
specially
strong
psychedelics
but
this
helped
me
to
be
more
conscient
of
that




was
a
little
nervous
but
very
excited
about
trying
dmt
for
my
first
time
having
previously
tripped
on
shrooms
liberty
caps
truffles
lsd
and
lsa
had
mentally
enjoyed
all
of
them
bar
my
sole
experience
on
truffles
which
was
a
bit
miserable
i
had
coped
with
that
well
though
i
thought
my
friend
dan
who
i
had
known
for
about
a
month
wanted
to
make
sure
i
really
felt
the
dmt
so
he
tipped
100mg
in
a
pipe
to
share
between
us
i
didnt
know
at
the
time
how
huge
this
dose
50mg
possibly
up
to
around
80mg
was
and
just
trusted
him
mistake

we
were
in
his
bedroom
both
sitting
up
on
his
double
bed
with
low-ish
lights
and
no
music
i
took
the
first
hit
and
passed
it
back
to
him
he
took
a
hit
and
passed
it
back
still
not
feeling
anything
i
made
my
second
rip
a
huge
one
and
felt
it
straight
away
my
last
sober-ish
thought
as
i
passed
it
back
was
\x93oh
dear
the
dmt
is
on
fire
as
it
was
still
burning

that
thought
and
passing
the
pipe
back
was
already
happening
very
slowly

well
i
took
too
big
a
rip
and
had
to
cough
as
i
exhaled
trying
to
keep
coughing
and
exhaling
in
steady
motions
though
because
i
didnt
want
to
start
hardcore
coughing
up
a
lung
my
coughs
felt
like
metallic
robotic
waves

my
coughs
felt
like
metallic
robotic
waves

i
feel
like
the
coughing
and
resulting
tightness
in
my
chest
led
to
me
feeling
uncomfortable
physically
and
played
a
big
part
in
my
bad
experience
although
of
course
theres
no
way
of
telling

well
i
lay
back
and
immediately
the
room
disappears
everything
is
replaced
with
a
very
dark
grey
kind
of
starry
scene
like
a
fuzzy
channel
on
a
tv
kind
of
its
hard
to
remember
the
order
of
things
but
i
remember
saying
\x93oh
jesus
im
not
a
christian
im
agnostic
but
things
were
already
getting
very
intense
and
i
guess
that
was
my
way
of
coping
dan
who
only
felt
very
mild
effects
either
because
i
burned
a
lot
of
it
or
smoked
a
whole
ton
with
my
second
hit
says
that
i
said
\x93oh
god
about
six
or
seven
times
after
that
i
remember
that
at
this
point
i
still
remember
where
i
am
i
guess
and
that
dan
is
there
and
i
was
wanting
him
to
kind
of
help
me
i
guess
but
not
knowing
him
well
enough
to
ask
or
knowing
what
he
could
even
do
at
least
for
the
first
couple
of
oh
gods
anyway

the
accompanying
feeling
was
one
of
intensity
to
put
it
mildly
i
was
in
the
dark
grey
starry
place
which
kind
of
felt
like
space
and
things
were
rushing
past
me
i
guess
and
just
sort
of
happening
to
me
all
at
once
my
skull
felt
like
it
was
being
crushed
by
everything
i
was
experiencing
i
was
still
saying
oh
god
at
this
point
i
guess
i
remember
thinking
from
what
i
had
read
that
it
would
all
be
over
in
a
hour
and
the
thought
of
20
minutes
crept
in
relating
to
the
bulk
of
the
experience
but
i
couldnt
be
sure
what
that
meant
or
if
it
was
true
20
minutes
was
also
too
complicated
to
process
so
i
disregarded
it
the
thought
of
it
being
only
an
hour
didnt
comfort
me
because
i
had
no
idea
what
an
hour
was
anymore
it
didnt
really
exist
where
i
was

im
not
really
sure
what
happened
next
dan
says
i
went
quiet

i
certainly
wasnt
aware
of
being
in
dans
room
with
dan
anymore
discussing
the
story
with
my
friend
henry
he
proposed
i
may
have
experienced
ego-death
this
may
be
true
i
cant
remember
most
of
what
happened

eventually
the
starry
darkness
which
was
my
world
started
to
fade
the
last
thing
i
saw
was
the
image
of
space
or
whatever
with
a
dark
figure
slightly
left
of
the
centre
of
my
vision
i
knew
the
man
or
man-type-thing
wasnt
good
but
it
wasnt
bothering
me
or
talking
to
me
and
i
was
leaving
it
i
realized
i
was
now
sitting
up
and
looking
straight
ahead
to
the
end
of
the
room
into
the
en-suite
bathroom
i
was
also
rubbing
my
face
and
sweating
a
lot
at
this
point
i
could
see
both
the
bathroom
and
the
starry
scene
simultaneously
i
was
still
feeling
intensely
anxious
isnt
quite
the
word
but
close
enough
seeing
the
bathroom
had
brought
me
home
to
some
extent
but
i
was
still
completely
unaware
of
dans
presence
or
anything
but
what
i
had
just
experienced
and
was
still
sort
of
experiencing
i
also
came
to
some
detached
realisation
that
the
dark
figure
i
saw
had
been
the
devil
looking
back
on
it
though
i
dont
think
this
is
entirely
appropriate
the
figure
was
bad
but
it
wasnt
completely
radiating
evil
perhaps
it
had
been
in
those
moments
i
cant
remember
though

at
this
point
dan
got
up
and
i
watched
him
leave
the
bed
to
put
some
music
on
his
laptop
this
was
like
a
revelation
for
me
that
i
am
a
person
in
this
room
dan
is
also
a
person
who
is
here
with
me
he
can
move
so
i
can
move
i
can
leave
this
place
i
pretty
much
sobered
up
kind
of
instantly
then
it
really
brought
me
back
to
earth
the
worst
of
the
bad
feeling
the
fear
went
away
here
after
i
realized
i
was
no
longer
trapped

i
think
my
first
words
were
something
like
\x93that
was
the
worst
experience
of
my
life
which
was
honestly
close
to
the
truth
dan
was
really
shocked
and
apologetic
he
had
thought
i
was
really
enjoying
myself
i
guess
oh
god
is
an
ambiguous
turn
of
phrase
i
followed
this
up
with
\x93i
dont
think
im
ever
going
to
take
acid
again
which
didnt
pain
me
to
say
at
the
time
because
as
much
as
i
was
completely
in
love
with
lsd
at
this
point
i
felt
mentally
broken
after
this
experience

i
felt
mentally
broken
after
this
experience

slowly
i
told
dan
what
had
happened
although
the
memory
of
the
bulk
of
the
entire
trip
had
already
completely
faded
what
i
am
describing
here
are
just
the
snippets
i
can
remember
i
slowly
calmed
down
but
i
felt
very
detached
from
dan
and
told
him
i
felt
as
though
\x93i
didnt
know
him
at
all
i
wasnt
upset
with
him
about
the
dose
or
anything
that
was
literally
just
how
i
felt
at
that
time

dan
told
me
the
whole
experience
had
been
about
two
or
three
minutes
long
i
couldnt
believe
it
especially
as
i
now
felt
pretty
much
sober
and
my
vision
didnt
seem
impaired
at
all
i
didnt
notice
any
real
after
effects
apart
from
the
feeling
of
detachment
already
i
couldnt
get
in
touch
with
the
intense
feelings
of
not-quite-the-words-but-almost
fear
and
panic
i
had
just
had
i
was
out
of
it
it
had
happened
i
couldnt
change
that
i
was
upset
with
myself
i
had
not
risen
to
meet
the
challenge
that
was
dmt
i
had
always
been
able
to
handle
anything
hallucinogens
threw
at
me
before
i
felt
weak
i
thought
of
my
friend
and
to
some
extent
mentor
henry
and
felt
like
i
had
let
him
and
myself
down
this
is
what
i
had
always
told
him
i
wanted
but
i
hadnt
stepped
up
well
i
resolved
i
would
try
again
and
next
time
take
less
and
not
let
it
get
the
better
of
me
i
wanted
to
master
this
drug
i
would
not
give
up

when
i
later
found
out
how
much
i
had
smoked
i
was
relieved
as
i
had
an
explanation
for
the
intensity
of
the
experience
about
10-20
minutes
after
the
dmt
perhaps
time
was
probably
still
funky
for
me
i
got
up
and
smoked
the
last
of
my
weed
a
pretty
small
amount
in
a
bong
to
really
make
it
hit
home
it
really
helped
soon
i
felt
a
lot
lot
better
the
anxiety
had
completely
dissipated
and
i
was
able
to
play
cod
although
i
was
worse
than
usual
my
awful
playing
was
as
funny
as
hell
though
i
was
over
the
experience

i
still
havent
tried
dmt
again
although
i
will
soon
as
a
friend
has
some
i
will
just
be
sure
to
take
less
and
try
hard
not
to
choke
i
feel
the
experience
was
very
necessary
to
give
me
a
hint
of
what
+3
and
+4
could
be
like
up
til
now
i
was
confident
i
could
handle
an
intense
trip
on
shrooms
or
lsd
because
it
was
something
i
was
actively
seeking
without
my
bad
dmt
trip
i
may
have
ended
up
pushing
myself
very
far
with
one
of
those
drugs
when
i
wouldnt
have
been
prepared
things
could
have
ended
up
very
bad
and
not
for
two
minutes
but
for
eternities
maybe
i
am
still
not
fully
prepared
now
but
i
feel
i
have
a
better
understanding
of
what
to
expect

in
closing
measure
your
doses
carefully
and
read
up
on
what
to
expect
for
each
level
of
dose
peace




i
have
since
discovering
it
in
high
school
always
wanted
to
do
dmt
ive
researched
it
religiously
since
first
hearing
about
it
and
up
until
this
past
summer
i
was
never
able
to
find
it
i
knew
that
this
would
be
the
perfect
chance
to
experience
it
given
that
i
was
renting
my
friends
family
summer
home
i
was
finally
able
to
experience
everything
that
ive
read
about
or
maybe
something
even
better


so
after
i
was
able
to
get
my
hands
on
this
beautiful
drug
i
was
incredibly
eager
to
try
it
my
first
couple
of
trips
were
nothing
more
than
warm
ups
since
i
wanted
to
test
the
waters
before
diving
in
head
first
like
so
many
people
who
have
bad
times
do
towards
the
middle
of
the
summer
i
was
able
to
experience
some
of
the
best
trips
of
my
life
one
had
me
taken
by
an
entity
who
showed
me
some
of
the
most
amazing
works
of
art
i
had
ever
seen
it
was
almost
as
if
the
colors
where
speaking
to
me
in
a
way
only
i
could
understand
the
next
few
had
me
enter
an
entirely
new
world
with
shapes
and
patterns
i
could
never
understand
while
my
trips
themselves
where
never
unpleasant
though
most
were
intense
i
have
had
only
one
so
far
that
has
left
a
mark
on
me
by
giving
me
what
i
believe
to
be
a
strong
warning

to
preface
this
trip
i
need
to
give
you
a
little
bit
of
background
information
so
my
friends
family
owns
the
house
that
me
and
my
friend
were
staying
at
and
would
often
visit
on
weekends
this
was
all
well
and
good
though
since
we
would
get
heads
up
in
advance
to
ready
the
house
for
their
arrival
now
given
that
my
friends
family
was
very
anti-drug
there
was
a
tad
risk
to
doing
dmt
in
the
house
im
almost
certain
if
they
had
found
the
crack
pipe
i
use
to
vaporize
dmt
they
would
have
called
the
cops
ive
never
ran
into
any
problems
in
that
regard
so
i
guess
things
turned
out
better
than
expected
however
my
final
dmt
trip
showed
me
just
what
could
have
been
had
this
had
played
out
differently

it
was
towards
the
end
of
summer
i
believe
it
was
my
last
day
staying
in
the
house
when
i
decided
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
trip
now
my
friend
did
inform
me
a
few
days
ago
that
part
of
his
family
would
be
stopping
through
but
since
they
were
a
no
show
i
took
it
as
an
all
clear
to
take
off


i
went
down
to
my
usual
spot
where
i
smoke
dmt
on
a
nice
comfy
couch
in
a
partially
lit
room
there
i
prepared
myself
for
the
trip
i
usually
quiet
my
mind
and
meditate
for
a
few
minutes
before
tripping
as
that
tends
to
help
with
the
intensity
of
the
trips

i
usually
quiet
my
mind
and
meditate
for
a
few
minutes
before
tripping
as
that
tends
to
help
with
the
intensity
of
the
trips

i
gathered
my
supplies
and
started


first
hit
started
off
like
every
other
a
dull
buzzing
a
feeling
of
happiness
and
some
small
visual
distortion
the
second
hit
was
where
i
knew
something
was
off
as
soon
as
i
held
the
hit
in
my
lungs
everything
got
yellow
as
if
someone
had
covered
all
the
lights
in
a
translucent
yellow
wrapping
i
started
to
feel
my
mind
slipping
which
startled
me
since
that
normally
happens
on
my
third
or
fourth
hit
i
began
to
panic
slightly
as
i
went
for
the
third
hit
in
order
to
truly
see
what
this
trip
had
in
store
as
soon
as
i
closed
my
eyes
i
heard
a
banging
which
i
assumed
was
my
friends
family
member
i
had
no
idea
that
what
follows
was
a
hallucination
until
i
was
completely
sober


i
had
pictured
my
friends
family
catch
me
crack
pipe
in
hand
tripping
out
in
this
hallucination
my
friends
uncle
tore
me
from
where
i
was
sitting
and
in
a
sort
of
cartoonish
fashion
tossed
me
out
the
front
door
it
was
there
where
i
thought
i
was
surrounded
by
officers
all
coming
closer
to
detain
me
i
didnt
realize
this
until
after
the
trip
but
i
instinctively
grabbed
onto
the
speaker
next
to
me
which
at
that
point
i
was
certain
that
it
was
an
officers
helmet
and
waving
it
sporadically
saying
something
along
the
lines
of
what
is
this
why
is
this
happening

this
went
on
for
some
time
until
i
could
pull
myself
back
at
which
point
i
realized
i
was
still
sitting
on
the
couch
a
sense
of
unfathomable
relief
washed
over
me
as
i
realized
it
was
all
part
of
the
trip
shaken
a
bit
i
went
outside
for
a
bit
of
fresh
air
and
to
stop
the
paranoia
that
the
police
were
there


once
i
collected
myself
i
started
to
realize
that
dmt
though
a
bountiful
drug
is
still
an
illegal
one
with
great
consequences
should
one
get
caught
with
it
it
was
from
then
on
that
i
realized
that
i
need
to
be
more
careful
with
where
i
choose
to
smoke
and
that
i
should
always
make
sure
its
safe




ive
never
experienced
anything
remotely
close
to
the
intensity
of
this
combination

i
rarely
detail
experiences
ive
had
because
words
simply
dont
do
them
justice
but
this
is
an
exception
because
i
feel
it
is
something
i
need
to
share

of
course
the
more
incredibly
intense
it
gets
the
harder
it
gets
to
explain

nevertheless
ill
at
least
make
an
attempt

lately
ive
been
having
weekly
tripping
sessions
with
a
group
of
4
friends

i
introduced
all
of
them
to
lsd
and
weve
been
having
some
incredible
experiences
together

i
absolutely
love
this
drug

ive
introduced
dmt
to
three
of
them
and
ive
had
mixed
responses

they
all
had
trouble
smoking
the
stuff
as
i
use
an
oil
burner
pipe
but
one
of
them
didnt
feel
it
very
much
at
all
another
had
a
pleasant
mild
trip
and
the
third
had
an
extremely
unpleasant
experience
though
she
only
took
one
hit
so
it
wasnt
too
difficult
to
handle

i
decided
to
try
my
hand
at
smoking
dmt
on
lsd
the
other
weekend
and
took
two
hits
of
it
and
had
an
incredible
time

it
wasnt
a
breakthrough
by
any
means
but
it
was
a
pleasant
intensifying
of
the
lsd
visuals
that
blew
me
out
of
the
water
at
the
time

it
was
good
stuff
and
i
wanted
to
emulate
that
experience
this
weekend

so
this
time
i
went
for
three
hits
of
lsd
as
weve
all
been
gradually
stepping
up
our
dosage

it
was
an
incredible
day
and
we
dosed
about
930am

we
spent
the
first
few
hours
of
the
experience
indoors
handling
the
peak
listening
to
music
watching
milkdrop
etc

then
we
went
outside
and
explored
the
creek
near
one
of
their
houses
that
we
were
staying
at

it
got
cold
and
we
decided
to
head
back
inside
and
i
wanted
to
smoke
dmt
again

my
friend
said
he
was
down
and
the
other
two
decided
not
to

we
sit
down
and
put
on
the
grateful
dead

so
he
takes
two
medium
sized
hits
and
lays
back
and
starts
to
have
a
good
time

i
was
relieved
because
of
the
bad
experience
our
other
friend
had
so
i
felt
confident
in
doing
it
this
time

we
had
started
a
stopwatch
on
one
of
our
phones
to
keep
track
of
how
long
we
held
the
hits

i
had
switched
it
on
when
my
friend
started
taking
his
hits
and
so
i
started
taking
mine
probably
3-5
minutes
after
it
had
started

so
i
took
a
small
hit
held
for
thirty
seconds
as
always
and
let
it
out

then
i
lit
up
another
slightly
bigger
hit
and
repeated

when
the
third
hit
came
around
and
i
started
inhaling
the
bulb
of
the
pipe
completely
fogged
up
with
the
vapor

i
dont
think
i
had
ever
taken
a
hit
that
big
before

but
i
took
it
held
it
in
and
thats
when
things
got
real

i
have
no
recollection
of
letting
that
hit
out

in
fact
as
any
of
you
who
have
experienced
a
breakthrough
dose
of
dmt
should
know

much
of
the
experience
was
blacked
out

the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
lying
on
the
ground
on
my
stomach

i
didnt
know
where
i
was
what
was
happening
why
it
was
happening
what
time
it
was
or
who
i
was

i
struggled
to
get
a
hold
of
reality

i
opened
my
eyes
wide
and
couldnt
see
a
single
thing
at
some
points

the
world
was
replaced
with
a
horrid
nightmarish
world

when
i
could
get
glimpses
of
what
was
around
me
the
room
was
a
huge
swirl
like
a
blender

stuff
was
everywhere

all
of
the
things
we
had
on
the
floor
were
scattered
everywhere
and
there
were
dozens
of
each
object

i
saw
so
many
copies
of
my
cell
phone
and
the
oil
burner
pipe
and
jars
and
clothes
and
all
sorts
of
things

nothing
made
any
sense

i
pulled
my
hand
out
from
under
me
and
the
pipe
was
clenched
in
it

as
i
was
looking
at
it
it
completely
vanished
and
reappeared
on
the
ground
next
to
me

i
was
dizzy
and
completely
delusional

i
kept
thinking
what
time
is
it
and
whats
happening
to
me
but
most
importantly
am
i
hurt

am
i
okay

am
i
dying

i
looked
up
to
see
my
friend
kneeling
by
me
trying
to
talk
to
me
in
a
calming
voice
but
i
couldnt
understand
him

not
a
word
he
was
saying

it
was
complete
gibberish

all
the
while
these
thoughts
were
swarming
my
head
and
i
struggled
to
ask
him
if
i
was
hurt
but
i
couldnt
articulate
the
thought
into
words

i
kept
thinking
i
have
to
ask
him
if
im
okay

ask
him
but
i
couldnt
speak

i
just
looked
back
up
at
him
when
he
was
speaking
nonsense
and
shook
my
head
and
curled
back
up
into
a
ball

i
had
to
just
lay
down
and
recede
into
myself

i
had
no
choice

i
faded
in
and
out
of
consciousness
several
times

my
life
was
flashing
right
before
my
eyes

it
was
like
a
blurred
tunnel
of
visions
that
came
to
me
from
my
past

it
felt
like
i
zoomed
through
my
entire
life
in
a
flash
going
over
everything
that
happened
to
me

it
got
to
that
day
and
the
days
events
flashed
through
my
mind

i
made
a
tremendous
effort
to
figure
out
at
what
point
my
memory
stopped

i
remember
being
at
the
creek
jumping
on
rocks
which
im
hugely
fond
of
doing
on
lsd
and
climbing
on
the
rickety
maintenance
bridge
we
found

had
i
fallen
off

that
was
the
only
possibility
i
could
think
of

i
must
have
fallen
and
hit
my
head
and
had
been
rushed
to
the
er

i
pulled
my
head
up
and
looked
around
the
room

it
wasnt
the
room
i
started
in

it
was
somewhere
else

it
looked
huge
and
tiny
at
the
same
time
pulsating

it
looked
nothing
like
the
room
we
were
in

i
looked
around
and
saw
that
all
three
of
my
friends
werent
in
there
with
me

the
police

the
police
must
have
come
and
found
out
what
happened

we
were
busted

it
was
all
over

my
life
was
ruined

i
figured
my
friends
were
in
the
other
room
talking
to
an
officer
and
explaining
that
i
was
on
dmt
and
they
were
waiting
for
me
to
become
sane
again

the
dread
of
that
combined
with
the
feelings
of
sheer
terror
i
had
felt
already
and
i
was
losing
it

i
saw
everything
important
to
me
before
me
demolished
and
destroyed

if
i
wasnt
dying
already
and
the
thought
had
occurred
to
me
several
times
there
were
times
when
i
thought
this
was
the
only
explanation
my
life
may
as
well
have
been
over

everything
and
everyone
i
cared
about
vanished
before
my
eyes
destroyed

i
had
become
insane

lost
my
mind

even
if
i
survived
this
hellish
nightmare
i
would
never
be
sane
again

i
would
never
be
happy
again

i
managed
to
look
up
and
saw
that
my
friend
was
back
in
the
room
and
sitting
on
the
couch

the
window
was
behind
him
and
the
light
shining
in
obscured
his
face

he
looked
divine
but
it
was
no
comfort
to
me

i
rolled
back
over
and
fell
into
it
again

i
came
back
to
and
pulled
myself
up
and
flopped
onto
the
couch

i
faded
in
and
out
of
reality
as
all
these
thoughts
of
dread
and
loss
flooded
my
mind
and
broke
me

ive
had
a
few
bad
trips
on
mushrooms
but
they
dont
compare
to
this

not
even
close

i
was
convinced
i
would
never
feel
happiness
which
has
happened
to
me
on
a
horrible
mushroom
trip
before

then
the
thought
hit
me
as
i
started
to
realize
what
was
happening

the
concept
of
a
bad
trip
came
back
to
me
and
i
remembered
i
had
smoked
dmt
and
things
began
to
make
a
little
more
sense

i
was
completely
delusional
though

intellectually
i
knew
that
this
would
all
be
over
soon
and
i
knew
i
had
to
remind
myself
of
this
but
the
negative
feelings
overcame
all
rationality
and
i
became
extremely
depressed

the
door
opened
and
my
friend
came
back
in
and
sat
on
the
chair
next
to
me

he
asked
me
if
i
wanted
some
water
and
i
weakly
nodded
and
he
handed
me
the
bottle
i
had
brought
and
i
carefully
cracked
open
the
cap
and
took
a
sip

i
just
then
realized
how
much
my
throat
and
mouth
burned

the
water
helped
even
though
it
gave
me
a
bit
of
a
coughing
fit

i
started
burping
quite
a
bit
and
my
friend
said
youre
not
gonna
throw
up
on
me
are
you

i
sort
of
chuckled
and
said
no

my
head
nodded
back
over
and
i
closed
my
eyes

things
were
still
horrifying
but
reality
was
slowly
starting
to
fade
back
in

i
remembered
that
the
only
way
out
of
this
nightmare
was
to
let
go

it
took
more
effort
than
id
care
to
admit
to
just
lay
back
still
and
ride
it
out

all
the
while
i
was
muttering
things
like
holy
shitfuck
that
was
bad
really
bad
really
bad
idea
why
did
i
do
that

oh
my
god

but
at
least
now
i
could
understand
english
again
and
could
begin
to
communicate

i
had
pieced
everything
back
together
and
began
to
understand
what
had
happened
to
me
but
the
feelings
still
remained
and
i
was
weak
broken
and
destroyed

our
other
two
friends
came
back
in
and
one
asked
if
i
was
okay
and
i
told
her
yes
yes
ill
be
fine
just
give
me
another
minute

then
i
remembered
the
time

what
time
was
it

i
had
to
know

i
had
to
know
how
long
i
was
out
for

i
asked
my
friend
and
he
didnt
know

i
remember
in
the
haze
and
confusion
i
looked
at
my
phone
and
saw
that
it
was
403

now
i
looked
at
it
and
it
was
423

i
didnt
put
that
together
and
it
was
meaningless

just
numbers

nonsense

i
slipped
back
into
the
couch
with
my
eyes
clothes
whimpering
and
grunting
a
little
bit

at
some
point
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
bathroom

the
concept
of
time
didnt
mean
anything
to
me
and
the
memory
of
it
is
jumbled
and
segmented

i
finished
the
bottle
of
water
when
i
came
back
and
laid
back
to
relax
and
let
the
rest
of
it
dissipate

the
other
two
had
gone
back
into
the
other
room
and
it
was
just
me
and
my
friend
who
had
stuck
with
me

he
sat
next
to
me
and
i
was
on
the
verge
of
sobbing

i
started
to
talk
to
him
in
a
soft
weak
voice
and
i
kept
repeating
that
that
was
a
bad
idea

that
was
a
horrible
idea

how
could
i
have
been
so
careless

i
started
to
explain
to
him
a
little
bit
of
what
had
happened
though
it
was
still
a
mess
in
my
mind

he
told
me
when
i
was
on
the
floor
and
he
was
trying
to
talk
to
me
i
stared
at
him
with
eyes
wide
open
and
a
blank
face
and
that
my
pupils
were
completely
dilated

im
the
only
one
of
the
four
of
us
that
doesnt
have
dark
brown
eyes
and
he
said
that
there
was
absolutely
no
color
in
them

i
was
apparently
shaking
rolling
about
a
bit

he
said
he
brought
the
other
two
out
of
the
room
so
that
things
would
calm
down
a
bit

everything
was
fine

nothing
was
broken
the
police
hadnt
come
and
i
was
beginning
to
grasp
reality
again

i
was
going
to
be
okay

he
also
said
that
there
was
one
song
that
came
on
right
as
i
started
to
fall
into
the
bad
trip

i
had
put
on
the
best
of
skeletons
from
the
closet
a
best-of
album
by
the
grateful
dead
and
the
song
that
came
on
was
called
rosemary

that
song
scares
the
shit
out
of
me
sober
for
some
reason
and
it
made
sense
that
that
song
triggered
that
negativity

it
very
well
could
have
been
the
cause
of
all
this

our
other
friends
came
back
in
the
room
and
one
of
them
found
the
phone
with
the
timer

it
was
still
running

this
was
at
the
point
when
i
was
just
starting
to
come
out
of
it
and
it
read
50
minutes

fifty
minutes

i
was
out
for
probably
about
forty-five
minutes

in
the
heat
of
the
experience
i
thought
it
would
all
be
over
in
10

in
all
honesty
i
would
have
guessed
i
was
gone
for
days

literally
days

it
felt
like
years

anybody
whos
experienced
a
breakthrough
knows
that
feeling

without
a
doubt
this
experience
was
the
most
terrifying
and
traumatizing
experience
of
my
entire
life

i
feel
like
this
sort
of
experience
is
the
worst
thing
a
human
being
can
go
through
and
come
out
okay
from

it
was
truly
humbling
and
has
inspired
a
higher
respect
for
these
drugs

thats
not
to
say
i
didnt
have
a
respect
for
them
already
but
im
surely
going
to
tread
with
more
caution
in
the
future

itll
be
a
while
before
i
combine
these
two
drugs
again
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
break
through
on
dmt
while
on
lsd
again

i
cant
imagine
a
worse
thing

one
post
on
the
internet
caught
my
eye
upon
rereading
it

this
combo
will
caused
me
to
completely
lose
all
control
and
any
sense
of
self
i
still
had
left
after
taking
lsd
the
boundaries
that
separate
my
body
from
my
surroundings
dissolved
and
i
mesh
with
the
ever
morphing
energy
surrounding
me

the
dmt
flash
that
followed
was
shocking
and
impossible
since
i
was
high
on
lsd
i
didnt
comedown
like
i
do
when
smoking
dmt
sober
but
remained
in
the
dream
for
a
significant
amount
of
time
a
lot
happened
but
it
wasnt
human
after
a
while
i
wasnt
functioning
as
a
human
anymore


when
i
finally
regained
control
the
dmt
afterglow
and
the
lsd
combined
to
give
the
feeling
of
surviving
an
extremely
death
defying
experience
i
was
in
a
state
of
shock
for
a
good
while


i
personally
love
this
combo
but
i
have
seen
it
break
people
before
so
think
deeply
about
whether
you
want
to
subject
your
mind
to
something
so
shattering
and
foreign

i
should
have
heeded
this
warning

this
describes
how
i
felt
exactly

thanks
for
reading
if
you
made
it
all
the
way
through

ill
definitely
never
forget
this
experience
and
the
lesson
i
learned
from
it

i
think
we
all
start
to
feel
invincible
at
some
point
in
our
psychedelic
careers

im
just
glad
i
pushed
the
limits
in
a
safe
environment
rather
than
somewhere
where
i
could
have
hurt
myself
or
others




i
am
very
young
and
lack
the
skill
required
to
portray
the
hell
i
endured
during
my
trip
for
that
i
apologize
i
considered
writing
this
later
when
my
writing
skills
have
further
developed
however
by
that
time
i
would
have
forgotten
much
of
the
trip
i
have
read
many
other
trip
experiences
and
decided
its
time
to
share
my
indescribable
event
with
others

i
would
like
to
start
this
entry
off
by
saying
i
was
very
young
and
immature
i
still
am
at
the
time
i
was
15
years
old
and
bored
with
my
life
i
had
done
salvia
a
couple
of
times
and
enjoyed
it
when
i
heard
a
dealer
would
have
dmt
available
i
was
instantly
interested
i
had
no
idea
what
i
was
getting
myself
into
my
dealer
had
dmt
crystals
available
previously
and
i
smoked
a
very
small
amount
around
10-15mgs
possibly
and
enjoyed
it
greatly
the
trip
was
beautiful
and
i
badly
wanted
to
repeat
it


the
day
had
come
when
my
dealer
had
maoi
available
for
consumption
with
dmt
pills
i
was
with
three
friends
my
dealer
had
provided
for
us
each
a
pill
i
was
given
an
extra
that
he
owed
me
my
pill
was
loaded
with
the
most
dmt
around
250mg
my
friends
each
had
about
150mg
in
theirs
we
walked
to
a
public
park
and
each
consumed
an
maoi
half
an
hour
later
at
802
we
took
the
pills
we
all
sat
down
relaxed
chilled
on
the
swings
and
waited
for
the
effect
to
kick
in


none
of
us
were
feeling
anything
after
about
an
hour
and
decided
to
contact
our
dealer
he
advised
to
wait
longer
as
it
is
tough
for
the
body
to
digest
we
returned
to
my
house
smoked
some
hookah
and
relaxed
waiting
for
the
effects
to
kick
in
about
half
an
hour
passes
and
my
sibling
informs
me
that
my
father
wants
to
have
dinner
with
me
yes
i
am
a
fucking
idiot
complete
idiot
i
chose
the
completely
wrong
setting
for
such
an
event
to
occur
i
proceed
inside
and
eat
with
my
dad
guacamole
and
bread
reality
is
buzzing
paranoia
is
taking
me
over
my
complete
surroundings
are
vibrating


my
father
does
not
notice
that
i
am
acting
very
strange
the
room
was
shaking
at
this
point
i
am
able
to
control
myself
but
struggle
doing
so
finally
i
finished
eating
and
return
to
my
friends
in
the
garage
finding
one
of
them
laying
on
the
stairs
i
am
informed
he
collapsed
he
is
able
to
communicate
with
me
and
i
tell
him
to
sit
up
i
am
completely
unaware
of
the
power
of
dmt
and
presume
to
assume
he
is
having
a
little
trouble
the
dmt
is
hitting
me
harder
and
harder
every
step
i
take
felt
like
taking
a
step
on
a
step
on
a
different
height


this
is
too
much
my
dealer
provided
for
us
kill
pills
some
sort
of
white
substance
i
have
no
idea
what
was
in
them
but
we
were
told
they
would
kill
our
trip
within
five
minutes
or
less
i
pull
the
pills
out
of
my
pocket
i
have
two
another
250mg
dmt
pill
and
a
kill
pill
tripping
so
hard
i
mix
up
the
pills
my
friends
take
the
proper
kill
pills
i
took
another
dmt
pill
accidentally
and
drank
half
a
can
of
an
energy
drink
another
mistake


i
took
a
step
outside
the
garage
leaving
my
friends
on
the
staircase
to
an
upstairs
apartment
colors
are
swerving
immediately
the
dmt
takes
me
completely
the
tree
began
to
breathe
the
leaves
had
eyes
i
look
at
the
grass
and
am
immediately
submerged
between
each
petal
i
looked
up
towards
the
sky
and
a
checker
board
took
over
the
checker
board
had
small
squares
those
of
blue
and
a
pinkish
purple
the
checker
board
was
in
a
kaleidoscope
effect
and
constantly
spiraling
i
can
barely
control
myself
and
walk
further
away
from
the
house
onto
a
field
that
is
apart
of
our
property
we
have
a
hill
under
a
fig
tree
where
i
choose
to
lay
down
as
walking
was
too
much
paranoia
was
destroying
me

the
effects
immediately
changed
i
was
a
camera
in
the
corner
of
a
room
a
completely
white
room
with
black
lines
for
the
outlines
of
the
walls
i
was
watching
an
alien
family
communicating
in
a
language
that
was
completely
gibberish
their
voices
were
extremely
high
pitched
and
every
word
they
said
was
unrecognizable
i
believe
i
was
in
this
stage
for
the
longest
time


colors
were
swerving
the
whiteness
turned
into
the
checkerboard
again
the
checkerboard
however
was
much
darker
black
and
purple
very
much
darker
there
was
no
more
sky
i
was
floating
inside
the
kaleidoscope
falling
and
falling
there
was
no
end
to
the
falling
my
body
was
doing
all
sorts
of
flips
at
this
point
i
had
lost
all
control
and
forgotten
about
reality
every
word
i
had
thought
in
my
mind
would
be
repeated
over
and
over
i
questioned
my
ego
every
word
i
thought
to
myself
was
changing
pitch
as
the
thought
was
being
processed
in
my
mind
as
i
created
each
statement
in
my
consciousness
my
mind
reprocessed
it
questioning
whether
it
was
legitimate
or
not
after
each
statement
was
produced
in
my
head
visual
subtitles
were
produced
to
follow
the
subtitles
were
flying
in
front
of
my
eyes
going
up
and
down
twisting
vertically
horizontally
in
numerous
ways
the
subtitles
were
also
being
bent
adapting
to
the
pitch
change
of
my
voice
this
is
all
in
a
layer
between
the
black
and
purple
never
ending
kaleidoscope
the
kaleidoscope
was
a
new
dimension
that
my
body
was
constantly
floating
in
i
was
thinking
to
myself

what
the
fuuuuuuaaaaackkkccccccckkk
is
theeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiiis

put
your
palm
to
your
mouth
and
produce
a
constant
sound
muffle
that
sound
by
flapping
your
palm
forward
and
away
from
your
mouth
ive
always
thought
thats
what
native
americans
did
or
something
anyways
thats
exactly
what
was
going
through
my
head
i
was
screaming
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
the
on
and
off
cut
up
of
my
speech
was
also
being
altered
by
the
change
of
pitch
i
kept
asking
myself
what
is
this

what
the
fuck
whats
happened
to
me
what
is
my
name
who
am
i
1
the
change
of
pitch
only
terrified
me
more
i
completely
lost
grasp
of
reality
and
myself
in
an
unknown
dimension
physically
and
emotionally
all
my
senses
had
blended
together
my
perception
was
fucked
inside
out
i
spoke
faster
and
faster
to
myself
yelling
cursing
my
brother
i
screamed
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
like
a
girl
as
loud
as
i
could
i
wanted
to
get
out
i
wanted
out
of
this
hell

this
part
is
extremely
hard
to
describe
during
this
part
i
had
felt
like
everything
before
this
experience
i
was
constantly
seeking
for
answers
seeking
for
a
quest
seeking
for
a
reason
for
life
a
purpose
of
life
at
this
time
of
the
trip
this
was
the
climax
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
blinded
from
the
truth
my
whole
life
and
now
this
was
it
the
truth
this
is
reality
everything
before
this
was
just
dream
this
is
reality
i
panicked
this
it
i
am
in
hell
this
is
what
my
parents
are
always
telling
me
about
i
am
in
hell
an
unrecognizable
pain
rises
from
the
back
of
my
throat
the
back
of
my
mouth
was
being
pried
open
a
cone
ten
times
the
size
of
my
throat
opening
was
being
forced
out
of
my
throat
to
the
forward
of
my
mouth
i
began
vomitting
i
did
not
know
i
was
throwing
up


this
has
was
the
most
painful
thing
ive
ever
experienced
in
my
life
and
never
want
to
go
through
anything
like
it
ever
again
the
throw
up
didnt
end
i
thought
to
myself
it
was
acid
and
tried
to
stay
away
from
it
yet
it
would
not
stop
coming
out
of
my
mouth
i
felt
as
if
my
whole
body
was
exploded
my
insides
were
bursting
out
of
me
i
had
lost
complete
identification
of
my
body
parts
and
simply
felt
as
if
i
was
falling
apart
the
acid
was
a
green
brown
color
and
came
out
of
me
like
large
diarrhea
i
screamed
i
screamed
and
did
not
stop
screaming
there
was
no
other
way
out
i
wanted
to
make
noise
i
wanted
out
of
this
hell


the
throwing
up
cools
down
and
i
am
yet
again
lost
in
this
unknown
dimension
i
hear
voices
around
me
did
he
take
drug
oh
no
hes
doing
drugs

this
part
i
can
describe
vividly
it
felt
like
a
lucid
dream
in
this
dream
i
was
collapsed
on
the
ground
a
reality
was
formed
a
stable
environment
was
around
me
the
environment
was
nothing
like
our
everyday
environment
but
it
was
stable
the
sky
was
blue
trees
were
green
however
it
was
all
like
a
painted
picture
a
picture
a
5
year
old
had
painted
with
water
pencils
nothing
was
sharp
everything
had
round
edges
to
it
i
was
on
the
ground
collapsed
laying
there
i
was
surrounded
by
people
everyone
was
asking
did
he
take
drugs
my
mind
processed
the
statement
and
absorbed
the
word
drug
the
word
drug
changed
meaning
the
word
went
under
numerous
changes
in
pitch
and
length
the
word
was
stretched
out
in
this
dimension
the
word
had
marked
my
death
sentence
the
term
drug
described
one
about
to
die
who
had
been
marked
by
the
horrible
disease
drug
was
a
disease
and
i
had
caught
it


i
was
in
this
state
on
the
ground
for
in
reality
was
about
half
an
hour
i
had
lost
all
track
of
time


finally
shapes
were
returning
to
their
original
form
reality
was
coming
back
a
layer
between
my
perception
and
my
real
environment
was
created
shapes
were
put
between
these
layers
the
trip
was
dying
down
i
ran
into
a
fence
head-on
as
i
was
being
chased
and
stabilized
by
my
family
i
kept
fighting
as
they
were
all
holding
on
to
me
keeping
from
hitting
for
objects
i
collapsed
onto
the
cement
drive-way
and
was
dragged
into
the
grass
i
laid
in
the
grass
spiralling
back
from
the
unknown
dimension
was
like
riding
a
never
ending
spiralling
slide
and
throughout
that
was
the
horrifying
checkerboard
of
black
and
purple
the
slide
ended
with
a
powerful
thump
and
i
was
back
faces
were
staring
at
me
this
return
to
reality
was
like
being
born
there
was
blood
on
my
shirt
i
was
in
complete
confusion
faces
were
staring
at
me
i
saw
our
house
and
the
car
for
the
first
time
slowly
things
were
coming
back
to
me
i
felt
as
if
i
was
seeing
everything
for
the
first
time
the
last
thing
i
remember
hearing
in
the
unknown
dimension
was
my
brothers
voice
he
said
my
name
and
asked
me
if
i
was
okay
hearing
his
recognizable
voice
was
like
seeing
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
i
was
in
instant
relief

that
was
the
trip
a
bad
fucking
trip
an
overdose
of
500mg
the
intended
amount
was
250mg
which
i
thought
was
supposed
to
last
for
an
hour
or
two
my
friends
were
alright
they
were
dropped
off
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
they
experienced
but
my
brother
told
me
they
were
wanting
hugs
from
him
i
am
happy
what
happened
to
me
did
not
happen
to
them
my
neighbor
heard
me
screaming
and
called
the
neighborhood
security
guard
who
came
and
assisted
my
family
in
wrestling
me
to
the
ground
he
asked
me
what
i
had
taken
and
i
yelled
in
his
face
dimethyltryptamine
the
security
guard
called
the
police
who
were
really
friendly
and
flashed
their
flashlight
in
my
eyes
and
took
me
up
inside
my
house
and
laid
me
on
the
bed
and
left
this
was
all
after
the
trip
ended
i
laid
on
the
bed
for
what
seemed
about
half
an
hour
until
everyone
had
left
this
bed
was
in
an
apartment
above
my
garage


after
i
regained
stability
i
was
helped
inside
the
house
to
my
room
halfway
there
i
collapsed
onto
the
tile
of
my
living
room
my
vision
was
completely
blurred
by
skinny
orange
lines
i
continued
my
voyage
up
the
stairs
and
into
my
room
i
was
in
so
much
pain
i
took
a
shower
and
slept
in
my
sleep
there
was
no
dream
i
shut
my
eyes
and
was
in
a
realm
of
black
pure
black
everywhere
i
woke
up
the
next
day
with
loose
braces
a
black
eye
ant
bites
all
over
my
body
my
palms
were
covered
with
ant
bites
texas
fire
ants
had
eaten
me
i
could
not
type
due
to
the
fire
ants
my
hands
were
completely
swollen
i
had
ant
bites
between
my
fingers
i
had
ant
bites
on
top
of
other
ant
bites
apparently
after
i
was
throwing
up
and
running
around
the
yard
i
rolled
around
in
ant
piles
this
is
most
likely
was
caused
the
unbearable
pain
and
hell
i
believe
the
energy
drink
and
food
i
had
eaten
before
caused
the
never
ending
throw
up


this
was
a
life
changing
experience
and
all
happened
two
days
before
my
15th
birthday
you
are
all
probably
thinking
im
a
fucking
idiot
and
you
are
100%
correct
i
messed
up
big
time
i
hope
what
i
have
written
is
beneficial
to
you
once
again
i
apologize
for
my
lack
of
description
i
have
read
numerous
other
posts
on
this
website
and
found
them
all
very
descriptive
and
written
professionally
i
fear
by
that
time
i
will
have
forgotten
my
experience


i
am
an
idiot
and
i
have
definitely
learned
from
my
mistake
dmt
is
an
extremely
powerful
substance
and
i
now
respect
it
for
its
capabilities
such
a
substance
should
be
used
wisely
i
will
not
be
tampering
with
psychedelics
until
i
am
older
and
my
brain
somewhat
returns
to
its
original
state
of
being
since
this
experience
my
brain
has
been
a
mess
my
life
has
changed
in
the
unknown
dimension
before
the
pain
i
met
with
my
ego
i
met
with
my
inner
soul
trapped
within
my
body
and
questioned
its
purpose
and
being
i
feel
like
i
must
return
to
this
realm
in
the
future
again
hopefully
in
the
future
in
a
much
safer
environment
i
am
happy
to
learn
from
my
mistakes
i
learned
a
lot
from
this
experience
a
lot
please
be
careful

not

the
rest
i
do
not
know
however
as
i
regained
consciousness
and
absorbed
reality
i
pulled
my
phone
out
of
my
wet
pants
and
read
1050pm
i
was
instantly
shocked
it
felt
like
so
much
more
time
had
passed




i
was
camping
with
a
bunch
of
friends
in
the
woods
it
was
raining
and
got
really
cold
so
we
decided
to
sit
around
in
the
tent
and
just
hang
out
and
pass
some
weed
around
we
smoked
for
about
15
minutes
until
my
friend
brought
up
that
he
brought
some
dmt
with
him
and
that
we
should
try
it
he
filled
up
the
mini
bong
with
a
tiny
bit
of
weed
and
a
points
worth
of
dmt

i
took
two
decent
sized
hits
and
kinda
got
a
strange
head
rush
and
the
body
high
was
unlike
anything
i
had
felt
before
i
was
very
heavy
and
it
felt
like
i
was
being
held
down
i
decided
to
stir
the
bowl
around
some
and
i
proceeded
to
take
another
hit
that
last
hit
happened
to
be
huge
and
i
remember
staring
at
the
tent
walls
and
all
of
my
friends
before
everything
went
black

all
of
the
sudden
i
cant
see
anything
then
i
hear
a
god
awful
noise
its
like
the
sounds
of
a
million
screams
and
every
siren
imaginable
all
i
see
is
intense
huge
spirals
and
swirls
of
rainbow
colors
going
insanely
fast
and
its
the
only
thing
i
can
see
i
dont
know
what
my
body
is
anymore
and
the
only
thing
i
can
feel
is
this
very
painful
sensation
coursing
through
whatever
it
is
i
think
is
my
body
it
feels
like
needles
are
all
over
me
and
im
being
twisted
into
a
million
knots
it
was
almost
like
i
was
being
toed
down
and
being
forced
to
watch
the
scariest
movie
imaginable
i
start
screaming
according
to
my
friends
which
lasted
for
about
a
minute
straight
i
think
i
was
making
the
siren
sounds
that
i
was
hearing
i
thought
i
was
in
another
reality
and
that
i
was
consumed
in
that
new
universe
i
had
stumbled
into
it
was
extremely
terrifying
and
it
felt
like
it
lasted
an
eternity
i
then
started
to
chomp
on
my
teeth
i
was
way
past
the
point
of
grinding
them
and
i
assumed
i
thought
that
me
moving
my
teeth
was
making
the
spirals
continue
to
go
it
felt
like
my
body
was
just
going
in
knots
and
circles
and
being
pulled
down
the
spirals
kept
going
and
i
kept
hearing
these
crazy
distorted
sounds
and
i
just
wanted
the
trip
to
end

i
couldnt
get
it
through
my
head
at
the
time
that
it
was
only
a
trip
and
it
would
be
over
soon
i
thought
i
was
stuck
in
that
terrible
spiraling
abyss
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
it
really
did
feel
like
more
than
a
lifetime
i
never
thought
it
would
end
and
i
just
wanted
to
cry

i
woke
up
after
about
7
minutes
and
was
clenching
my
bottom
lip
in
between
my
teeth
i
looked
up
at
the
top
of
the
tent
and
only
saw
orange
and
blue
circles
i
sat
up
and
looked
around
with
all
of
my
friends
looking
at
me
it
took
me
about
3
minutes
to
remember
everyones
name
and
i
had
to
go
around
the
circle
naming
off
names
and
trying
to
remember
where
exactly
i
was
at
i
immediately

stood
up
and
tried
to
run
out
of
the
tent
once
my
friends
opened
it
for
me
i
realized
it
was
freezing
out
and
raining
so
i
sat
back
down
i
wrapped
up
in
about
five
blankets
and
i
couldnt
stop
shaking
i
put
my
finger
in
my
mouth
and
ran
it
across
my
teeth
and
i
didnt
feel
any
teeth
in
my
mouth
only
gums
i
freaked
out
and
started
to
mumble
i
kept
my
finger
in
my
mouth
running
it
over
my
teeth
until
i
could
feel
them
again

my
friends
told
me
i
was
screaming
and
making
moaning
noises
for
about
a
minute
straight
and
that
i
had
opened
my
mouth
and
stuck
my
tongue
out
in
a
strange
way
i
also
was
breathing
extremely
hard
and
they
considered
trying
to
wake
me
up
i
was
only
out
for
about
5-8
minutes

dmt
was
a
very
insane
experience
for
me
and
i
dont
think
i
would
be
interested
in
doing
it
again
it
was
almost
too
much
for
me
to
handle
and
to
this
day
i
still
think
of
how
vivid
that
trip
was
and
it
still
scares
me
i
feel
like
ive
been
to
another
dimension
in
time
that
i
couldnt
escape
that
night
i
was
terrified
to
sleep
cause
i
didnt
know
if
i
would
have
a
dream
like
my
trip
was
i
feel
like
that
this
dmt
experience
really
changed
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
i
feel
like
ive
been
to
an
eternity
and
back
i
went
into
the
trip
with
a
fantastic
mindset
but
somehow
i
ended
up
seeing
the
most
terrifying
thing
of
my
life
please
be
safe
and
have
fun
dmt
is
a
crazy




my
first
experience
with
dmt
was
extremely
intense
extremely
bad
and
absolutely
the
most
excruciating
horror
of
my
life

and
that
doesnt
even
begin
to
describe
it

i
am
very
spiritually
enlightened
in
touch
with
my
chakras
and
have
vast
medical
knowledge
and
awareness
of
the
body
and
of
my
spiritual
body/third
eye
which
may
have
affected
my
experience



experience

i
was
out
of
town
with
my
husband
visiting
friends
and
i
was
having
a
great
weekend

i
had
known
on
this
trip
that
i
would
be
doing
dmt
but
didnt
do
much
research
on
it

oh
wait-
i
watched
2
youtube
videos
of
morons
talking
about
mechanical
elves

little
did
they
mention-
leaving
all
forms
of
fucking
reality
i
was
totally
unprepared
for
what
occurred

i
was
skeptical
that
it
would
even
do
anything-
because
i
have
done
so
much
lsd
and
mushrooms
and
had
yet
to
have
an
intense
visual
experience

i
do
smoke
pot
often
and
have
for
over
a
decade
but
im
not
a
wake
and
bake
type
of
smoker

the
night
before
we
did
the
dmt-
my
husband
his
friends
and
i
partied
hard

so
this
could
be
taken
into
consideration


we
had
smoked
7
bowls
of
ultra
premium
grade-
2
b-hits
and
2
shots
of
patron
tequila-
and
a
thc
chocolate
chip
cookie

oh
and
i
was
also
drinking
meade


that
night-
i
hardly
slept
and
was
constantly
awakening
to
what
i
thought
were
demonic
spirits
in
my
room
only
later
to
discover
that
the
house
was
indeed
haunted

but
i
also
knew
i
had
never
been
that
blown
in
my
life-
so
i
threw
it
up
to
being
high

i
normally
see
spirits
so
this
wasnt
unusual
only
that
they
felt
menacing
and
that
they
didnt
want
me
in
their
house



the
next
day
was
the
day
we
all
were
planning
on
doing
dmt
for
the
very
first
time


i
woke
up
the
day
of-
i
still
felt
high-
even
though
we
werent
smoking
anything
that
day
because
we
wanted
to
try
dmt
clean

however
i
felt
high
up
until
the
very
point
i
smoked
dmt



i
had
two
experiences
with
dmt

since
this
was
all
our
first
times
doing
dmt
we
decided
to
do
a
trial
run

since
we
were
going
to
be
smoking
it
a
glass
pipe
was
needed
but
flame
could
not
directly
hit
the
dmt

so
my
husband
and
his
bestfriend
rigged
an
aqua
globe
the
plant
waterer
things
and
drilled
a
hole
in
the
top
of
the
globe
and
with
a
funnel
poured
the
dmt
into
the
glass
aquaglobe

we
dipped
the
glass
mouthpiece
in
silicone
to
prevent
cuts

the
dmt
was
divided
out
into
carefully
measured
parts



we
started
with
30mg
of
dmt

we
smoked
it
in
a
glass
pipe
we
bought
for
this

all
three
of
them
smoked
it
and
said
that
it
tasted
terrible
like
\x93burnt
plastic
but
that
it
felt
good
and
\x93clean
that
things
felt
amplified

so-
i
thought-
ok
here
it
goes

i
smoked
my
first
hit
of
dmt-
which
as
we
had
studied
wouldnt
take
us
away
from
our
bodies

the
physical
buzz
of
smoking
this
drug-
is
extremely
similar
to
a
full
body
buzz
of
doing
nitrous

then
to
my
amazement-
i
saw
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
visuals

my
husbands
face
began
morphing
into
a
silly
puddy
face
and
every
movement-
every
sound
wave
created
the
most
beautiful
visuals-
lines
fractals
waves-
everywhere-
rainbows
so
beautiful-
i
was
so
taken
back
by
the
intensity
of
the
beautiful
visuals
i
was
witnessing
here
in
the
living
room
of
our
friends
house

it
was
so
intense-
just
this
one
trip-
while
i
was
going
through
it
i
thought
to
myself-
i
am
not
doing
the
full
amount

within
3
minutes
i
was
not
seeing
visuals
and
was
nearly
sober
but
experiencing
the
body
buzz


within
30
minutes
i
had
decided
to
go
through
with
the
full
blown
amount

we
took
an
hour
between
hits
so
that
we
could
come
down
mildly
between
the
hits

maybe
this
accounted
for
the
fact
that
i
had
the
type
of
trip
that
i
had

i
had
an
extremely
intense
trip
on
my
first
try
on
30mg

my
2nd
hit
of
dmt
was
60mg

i
was
the
4th
in
the
group
of
friends
that
took
the
60mg
hit

when
i
watched
the
other
three
take
it-
it
was
apparent
that
they
each
\x93left
their
bodies
and
that
they
were
at
peace

after
they
came
back
they
stated
that
it
was
the
most
intense
experience
of
their
life
that
they
saw
visuals
but
it
was
a
very
happy
peaceful
experience

i
was
leary
but
decided
to
buck
up
and
do
it



puff-
puff-
puff
everyone
kept
on
saying
dont
fight
it-
let
go-
let
go-
and
what
they
are
really
saying
is-
let
go
of
your
reality
and
body

i
was
terrified

i
take
the
final
hit
that
sent
me
to
hyperspace

i
felt
the
feeling
that
i
get
over
the
top
hill
on
the
roller
coaster-
that
gut
feeling
of
omg
i
cant
handle
this
gforce

except
that
feeling
didnt
go
away
like
it
does
on
a
roller
coaster

i
realized
that
i
was
completely
detached
from
my
body

i
wasnt
in
a
room
on
a
couch
in
a
house
on
earth

i
didnt
recognize
anything
around
me
from
this
universe

i
saw
fractals
geometric
patterns
psycodelic
imagery
all
around
me



space
and
time
didnt
exist

and
i
realized
that
this
was
the
space
in-between
the
spaces

the
code
behind
the
matrix

the
stuff
that
everything
is
made
of

and
that
is
when
the
chaos
sent
me
into
hysterics



suddenly
i
began
feeling
deep
rooted
emotional
terror
and
feelings
of
low
self
esteem
and
rejection
from
my
childhood

i
was
abused
in
my
childhood

i
felt
as
though
time
did
not
exist
and
i
had
no
idea
how
to
get
back
to
my
body

i
tried
physically
to
come
back
and
i
did
once
or
twice
i
remembered
opening
my
eyes
trying
to
reach
out
to
my
husband
who
saw
me
struggling
but
i
got
sucked
back
to
\x93dmt
land

i
remember
not
having
a
sensation
of
having
a
body
but
the
experience
of
having
conscious
thought

i
remember
seeing
the
horror
of
the
familiarness
of
not
being
in
reality
seeing
fractals
in
chaos
and
the
feelings
of
utter
degradation
of
self
the
power
of
feeling
worthless
in
the
eyes
of
everything

i
can
understand
how
people
can
experience
this
and
say
that
they
saw
god

it
is-
absolutely
mindfucking


how
can
i
explain
not
being
in
reality

3d
reality

at
one
point
during
the
trip
i
began
recognizing
images
or
i
began
putting
together
images
into
3d
objects
i
could
recognize
like
finding
shapes
in
clouds

i
began
witnessing
scenes
that
were
familiar
like
the
scene
from
dumbo
with
the
pink
elephants
on
parade

and
seeing
trippy
psychedelic
posters
from
the
60s

it
was
as
though
the
images
were
mocking
me
laughing
at
my
horror

i
felt
like
i
was
in
a
pink
floyd
album

as
i
came
back
i
remember
being
utterly
terrified
from
the
experience-
as
i
felt
my
body-
i
got
up
from
the
couch
and
ran
outdoors
trying
to
get
away
from
the
living
room-
the
place
where
i
experienced
the
worst
livid
horror
of
my
life

my
trip
was
very
bad
because
of
all
the
trauma
i
relived
during
my
dmt
trip

i
wish
i
could
recall
interesting
images
to
recall
to
you
but
i
cant
remember
the
images
but
i
remember
the
feelings


i
felt
so
much
anguish
and
horror
and
terror
and
bad
bad
things

i
think-
maybe
dmt
brings
the
worst
emotions
out
of
some
people

ive
had
a
very
hard
life
and
ive
had
to
push
a
lot
of
bad
emotions
down
to
deal
with
the
real
world

maybe
dmt
brings
out
what
i
refuse
to
acknowledge



dmt
pops
me
out
of
3rd
dimensional
reality

im
not
even
experiencing
what
i
would
experience
in
an
out
of
body
experience
or
when
i
die

i
would
know-
i
have
had
an
outerbody
experience
before

this
was-
another
realm
completely


its
an
innerknowing-
that
we
all
feel
after
experiencing
it-
that
it
is
somehow-
they
way
things
really
are
behind
the
curtain

to
this
day
i
have
no
idea
why
i
had
a
bad
trip

i
was
nervous
about
it
and
the
experience
was
the
most
intense
experience
of
my
life-
but
still-
so
were
the
other
people

there
are
parts
of
my
trip
that
i
know
i
experienced
but
am
not
able
to
remember

i
can
only
remember
the
trippy
fractals
even
though
i
know
i
experienced
reliving
childhood
trauma
to
some
extent

and
the
worst
part
of
it-
is
time
does
not
exist
so
it
goes
on
forever-
and
ever
and
ever

regardless
of
this
experience
i
am
determined
to
do
it
again

i
think
now
that
i
know
what
to
experience
i
will
not
freak
out

but
it
could
happen
and
i
am
open
to
that
too

no
one
could
have
prepared
me
to
feel
what
not
feeling
reality
feels
like

but
after
doing
dmt-
lsd
is
like
childs
candy


atleast
on
lsd
and
shrooms
i
realize
that
im
still
in
a
room-
on
planet
earth-
that
i
have
fingers
even
though
they
may
appear
3
feet
long
and
glowing

dmt
takes
me
to
a
place
that
is
the
center
of
all
of
creation

the
chaos
that
was
there-
before
god
created
matter

dmt
shows
me
a
place
that
only
the
gods
know
about

i
feel
blessed
to
have
had
this
experience
though
it
was
an
extremely
bad
trip

i
am
determined
to
try
it
again

it
has
forever
changed
me
it
is
a
life
changing
event

know
the
good
the
bad
and
the
ugly
of
dmt
before
you
do
it

after
effects



the
day
after
the
dmt
was
taken
i
felt
very
carefree
and
had
an
overall
slight
body
buzz

this
lasted
for
2-3
days
after
the
dmt

within
the
7
days
since
taking
dmt
i
have
smoked
marijuana
twice
and
ingested
it
once

the
first
time
i
smoked
since
dmt
i
had
the
hardest
high
since
i
was
a
teenager

on
day
7
i
ate
a
\x93brownie
and
literally
tripped
like
on
lsd
minor
visuals
and
everything
else
i
made
the
brownies
so
i
know
what
was
in
it


i
am
curious
to
the
effects
that
dmt
leads
with
with
other
mind
altering
substances



my
spiritual/psychic
gifts
have
increased
slightly
since
doing
dmt

the
next
day
after
doing
dmt
i
felt
cold
ice
chills
shooting
straight
into
my
pineal
gland

17
days
later
still
experiencing
cold
ice
sensation
at
top
of
my
head



my
personality
has
changed
in
a
dramatic
way
since
doing
dmt

i
cant
take
any
crap
from
anyone

which
can
be
a
good
or
bad
thing

i
used
to
not
say
anything
when
i
felt
i
was
being
wronged
or
whatever
but
now
now
i
speak
immediately
without
even
thinking-
without
even
curbing
what
comes
out
of
my
mouth

this
nearly
got
me
in
trouble
today
as
my
boss
handed
me
a
schedule
and
i
started
bitching
about
it-
which
is
something
ive
never
ever
done
before

again
its
a
good
trait-
to
not
care
what
others
think
about
you-
but
in
the
workplace
and
the
real
world
it
is
going
to
be
a
challenge
to
control

all
my
life
i
gave
a
damn
about
what
others
thought
but
after
doing
dmt-
none
of
that
matters
anymore



ultimately
dmt
has
changed
my
life
forever

and
only
those
who
have
journeyed
with
it
can
truly
understand
how
i
feel

notes
taken
after
doing
dmt

i
had
a
notebook
with
me
after
doing
each
dose
of
dmt
and
wrote
down
the
following
after
the
60
mg
experience

fractals/mandelbrot
willy
wonka
tunnel
roller
coaster
360
vision

no
eyes

\x93the

behind

absolute
chaos
no
concept
of

all
4
of
us
saw
psychedelics
i
understand
psychedelics
now
theres
nothing
in
existence
to
describe
dmt
dmt=
the
matrix
code




back
in
about
april
or
may
of
2012
an
associate
of
mine
had
whipped
up
a
batch
of
some
pure
dmt
he
had
about
75
grams
as
a
personal
cache
and
he
got
rid
of
the
rest
we
had
taken
it
orally
mainly
through
vaporization
or
by
coating
a
bowl
of
cannabis
with
it

after
about
a
month
or
so
of
doing
it
this
way
we
decided
to
take
it
to
the
next
level
he
soluted
it
in
with
ro
water
and
hydrochloric
acid
to
stabilize
the
base
he
injected
me
with
roughly
115x
the
dose
that
strassman
had
used
in
his
dmt
trials

this
is
my
story
of
the
events

after
the
solution
was
fully
injected
the
belt
on
my
arm
was
removed
i
was
slightly
apprehensive
of
the
dosage
but
not
scared
or
nervous
needles
dont
scare
me
approx
4
seconds
after
the
belt
was
removed
it
felt
as
if
i
was
kicked
in
the
diaphragm
by
a
mule
of
sorts
i
coughed
and
as
i
leaned
my
head
back
i
watched
as
my
vision
of
the
subtly
lit
room
was
invaded
from
the
outside
in
by
a
forming
opalescent
static
then
it
was
dark
for
a
split
second
before
i
was
then
torn
by
my
center
shakra
out
of
my
body

i
began
to
soar
out
of
the
limits
of
our
atmosphere
whizzing
past
moons
and
planets
going
progressively
faster

and
faster
as
the
vibrations
shook
my
soul
to
the
very
core
it
was
like
a
cacophony
of
static
sound
and
low
frequency
oscillators

it
was
like
a
cacophony
of
static
sound
and
low
frequency
oscillators



as
i
began
to
slow
down
i
began
to
become
slightly
more
conscious
of
my
surroundings
and
as
if
guided
by
a
higher
force
made
my
way
towards
a
nebula
of
massive
proportions
resembling
the
horse
head
nebula
i
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
plasmic
forces
of
the
gaseous
mass
witnessing
some
of
the
greatest
events
in
astrological
science

then
off
in
the
distance
a
light
began
to
shine
hazy
at
first
then
brighter
i
realized
it
was
approaching
me
at
a
moderate
speed
and
the
vibrations
stopped
it
was
silent
as
i
watched
this
4th
dimensional
tesseract
of
light
approach
and
envelope
me
i
later
identified
this
as
the
metatron
cube
as
it
blinded
me
with
heavenly
light
and
ambient
sound
i
grew
a
sudden
universal
understanding
yet
to
this
day
i
cannot
comprehend
entirely
what
it
meant
only
fragments
of
a
higher
nature
at
work
in
an
ouroboratic
state
of
space
and
time

i
was
then
launched
back
to
my
body
upon
arriving
i
opened
my
eyes
to
the
most
horrific
scenario
ive
ever
witnessed
ive
never
hallucinated
black
before
in
any
hallucinogenic
state
ive
taken
lsd
over
60
times
mushrooms
about
a
dozen
times
mescaline
various
2c
molecules
mdma
etc
and
ive
never
had
a
bad
trip
on
any
of
these
substances
but
this
was
on
a
level
of
sheer
terror
i
cant
even
fully
comprehend
unaware
of
my
associate
having
dosed
himself
in
a
like
manner
he
had
taken
a
slightly
smaller
dose
i
began
to
state
what
i
believed
happened

somethings
wrong
i
said
i
think
im
dying

and
although
claiming
to
have
been
completely
deaf
during
this
period
of
time
my
associate
had
the
sheer
instinct
to
detect
i
was
in
distress
and
calm
my
tits

no
way
man
its
ok
youre
going
to
be
ok
he
said

both
of
our
voices
were
distorted
as
run
through
a
matrix
filter
and
around
us
the
creeping
black
ichor
i
watched
spread
from
floor
to
ceiling
began
to
take
upon
a
form
in
the
corner
a
looming
twisting
figure
with
a
12
span
of
what
i
assume
were
wings
made
entirely
of
the
ichor
its
facial
features
distorted
to
the
point
of
and
unidentifiable
blur
yet
i
knew
it
was
watching
our
every
move
both
physical
and
metaphysical

i
identified
it
as
death
i
realized
that
i
had
died
and
that
i
was
rejected
from
my
spiritual
state
by
a
higher
power
but
that
the
escort
was
still
active
in
his
duties
my
life
in
its
entirety

began
violently
flashing
before
my
vision
shaking
my
vision
memories
of
my
childhood
i
thought
long
forgotten
began
to
become
significant
in
this
state
i
thought
of
my
mom

and
how
angry
she
would
be
that
this
is
how
i
would
die
this
thought
made
me
violently
ill
and
my
stomach
lurched
once
forcing
me
from
my
sprawled
position
to
an
upright
one
sitting
on
the
couch
i
was
on

i
looked
at
my
associate
and
mumbled
grab
a
bucket
but
it
was
too
late
i
threw
up
the
hamburger
i
had
eaten
prior
to
heading
to
my
associates
house
and
as
we
both
stared
at
it
things
began
to
become
slightly
clearer
gaining
the
ability
to
consciously
recognize
objects
became
obvious
after
i
noticed
the
pickle
sitting
in
the
mess
on
the
floor
the
trip
and
the
excitement
began
to
leave
my
self
and
associate
and
realizing
what
i
had
just
done
my
associate
stood
up
and
went
to
the
bathroom
to
vomit
himself
and
grab
paper
towels

afterwards
we
discussed
our
trips
in
great
detail
to
each
other
as
we
smoked
a
bowl
of
lavender
haze




on
one
morning
with
my
friend
ill
call
him
n
we
were
driving
over
to
ss
house
to
get
some
dmt
two
years
prior
i
had
been
obsessing
over
wanting
to
do
it
reading
all
of
the
posts
on
erowid
how
to
mentally
prepare
myself
for
the
journey
all
that
stuff
i
was
excited
to
finally
do
it


there
it
was
we
picked
up
some
crystals
weighed
them
out
to
be
a
total
of
700
mg
we
left
ss
house
and
headed
to
as
at
the
time
i
kept
a
bong
that
a
and
i
shared
at
his
house
we
grabbed
the
medicali
and
headed
back
to
ns
house
we
hiked
up
to
his
third
floor
where
there
was
a
lingering
odor
of
chinese
food
specifically
steamed
dumplings
from
the
previous
night
we
had
plenty
of
bud
and
alone
time
we
loaded
up
the
first
bowl
with
a
dmt
sandiwich
using
the
weed
as
the
bread


i
offered
to
go
first
we
had
put
water
and
ice
in
the
bong
because
the
2
percs
in
it
were
broken
due
to
my
own
stupidity
we
had
turned
on
ns
black
light
and
the
neon
natty
light
sign
just
for
kicks
we
had
some
music
playing
i
think
whats
beef
by
biggie
was
playing
at
the
time
i
lit
up
the
first
hit
was
smooth
fine
i
noticed
a
dramatic
alteration
in
the
taste
that
im
used
to
recieving
from
the
bong

the
second
rip
was
much
more
harsh
upon
inhaling
i
got
something
similar
to
a
headrush
this
prompted
me
to
move
up
from
the
floor
into
the
giant
black
all
encompassing
doggy-bed-ish
thing
that
n
provided
me
i
couldnt
keep
my
eyes
closed
but
while
open
the
loud
rumbling
from
behind
me
made
the
room
around
me
shake
and
vibrate
intensely

you
should
know
that
i
have
an
abnormally
high
blood
pressure
for
someone
my
age
its
not
dangerously
high
but
it
can
be
when
mixed
with
drugs
the
rumbling
is
climbing
higher
in
pitch
and
in
position
i
hear
it
in
two
places
high
above
me
and
far
behind
me
its
creeping
closer
to
me
but
higher
in
pitch
it
reaches
a
supersonic
level
of
sound
then
i
close
my
eyes

after
closing
my
eyes
i
remember
nothing
at
all

according
to
n
i
was
taking
short
quick
breaths
and
alot
of
them
he
said
that
he
could
visibly
tell
how
fast
and
hard
my
heart
was
pumping
blood
to
fuel
my
journey
he
said
each
beat
was
a
punch
to
my
chest
cavity
possibly
160
punches
per
minute
he
said
he
was
not
aware
of
my
high
blood
pressure
and
that
dmt
can
be
dangerous
if
mixed
with
someone
with
high
blood
pressure


he
told
me
i
slowly
opened
my
eyes
and
i
was
trying
to
say
something
or
i
was
just
moving
my
mouth
oddly
with
nothing
but
carbon
dioxide
exiting
quickly


i
woke
up
in
ns
car
i
asked
him
where
we
were
going
what
time
was
it
and
where
were
my
shoes
he
answered
but
i
coulnt
comprehend
it
at
the
time

i
dont
remember
anything
until
seeing
my
dad
sitting
in
the
pleather
chairs
provided
for
visitors
in
my
room
i
had
had
a
heart
attack
at
age
17


i
do
not
blame
this
on
anyone
but
myself
i
should
not
have
mixed
my
health
condition
knowingly
with

a
drug
that
increases
blood
pressure
please
be
careful
when
taking
this
journey
its
alot
to
take
in

once

in
a
truly

the
price

we

provided

the
copier
or
quoter
does
not
take
credit
for
our
statements

we
each
had
taken
150
mg
of
pure
mda
the
differences
from
mdm
are
striking
mda
is
more
hallucinogenic
with
noticeable
closed
eye
imagery
is
a
much
greater
aesthetic
enhancer
especially
of
people
and
of
music
is
more
euphoric
more
drug-like
a
heavier
and
more
obviously
body-involved
trip
tactile
sensation
is
more
powerful
erotic
and
noticeable
on
mda
physical
effects
are
more
up-front
gastric
upset
pupil
dilation
water
retention
limbic
arousal
on
the
whole
we
find
mda
a
more
enjoyable
and
interesting
trip
longer
lasting
and
more
sexual/sensual
our
favorite
characteristic
is
that
one
retains
an
interesting
psychedelic
ideation
on
mda
rather
then
the
feeling-oriented
but
rather
idealess
thinking
of
mdm

that
evening
we
were
very
taken
with
the
musical
enhancement
--
we
are
both
avid
listeners
--
and
had
found
mdm
to
actually
interfere
with
our
enjoyment
of
music
mda
goes
especially
well
with
second-rate
classical
music
the
lushness
and
color
of
strauss
lizst
rimsky-korsakov
smetana
and
other
ethnic
and
minor
romantic
composers
are
very
compatible
with
the
sensual
fantasy
aspects
of
mda
we
were
playing
smetana
the
moldau
a
tone
poem
about
the
major
river
in
czechoslovakia

during
the
past
several
weeks
i
had
had
several
episodes
of
allergic
reaction
which
were
unusual
for
me
possible
causes
included
the
spring
weather
and
flowers
gardening
adjustment
to
the
west
coast
and
six
months
of
regular
dmt
use
while
the
music
was
playing
i
noticed
increased
allergic
symptoms
this
is
unusual
on
mda
which
as
andrew
weil
points
out
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
allergy
suppressors
around
and
so
it
has
always
affected
me
in
the
past

along
with
the
allergic
response
i
began
to
note
the
familiar
goddess-possession
phenomenon
which
we
had
first
encountered
on
mda-lsd
trips
and
which
led
us
to
our
first
profound
trips
and
contact
experiences
this
time
it
was
subtle
perhaps
because
no
lsd
was
involved
at
the
same
time
a
series
of
flashes
false
memories
or
past
life
reminiscences
occurred
having
to
do
with
rivers
and
my
riverine
ancestry
triggered
by
the
content
of
the
music

this
is
a
characteristic
of
mda
experience
which
we
had
not
encountered
on
mdm
where
memories
are
more
personal
and
less
archetypal/symbolic
with
mda
memories
one
can
become
caught
up
in
an
associative
web
of
ancestral
material

during
this
whole
period
i
had
continuing
allergic
symptoms
zarkov
felt
fine
and
was
having
a
great
time
this
dichotomy
is
even
more
noticeable
since
zarkov
is
usually
the
one
with
allergy
problems
i
showered
off
and
washed
my
face
but
i
still
felt
uncomfortable
and
uneasy
we
have
noted
on
several
occasions
that
allergic
reactions
had
preceded
profound
contact
trips

about
hour
4
i
decided
to
try
smoking
some
dmt
my
blood
pressure
and
pulse
were
only
slightly
elevated
but
i
still
felt
restless
and
uneasy
the
week
before
i
had
reset
an
mdm
trip
with
dmt
the
dmt
seemed
to
have
had
a
calming
and
healing
effect

i
smoked
about
40
mg
in
4-5
tokes

as
it
came
on
i
asked
the
dmt
entities
for
help
and
guidance

i
kept
my
eyes
open
until
the
visual
changes
became
overwhelming
the
whole
room
was
being
transformed
into
the
characteristic
dmt
crysthanthemum
pattern
i
closed
my
eyes
and
fell
back
into
the
trance

the
first
thing
i
saw
was
the
visible
language
the
words
the
shapes
the
music
the
music
refers
to
the
dmt
auditory
effects
not
music
in
this
reality
and
the
stereo
was
off
during
this
part
of
the
trip
and
the
voices
all
carried
the
same
message
strong
safe
strong
safe
help
ok
ok
help
safe
safe
alright
the
elves
appeared
they
sang/i
saw/read/felt/heard
they
are
made
out
of
the
visible
language
the
message
is
conveyed
by
the
medium
itself
in
several
simultaneous
sensory
modalities
vision
heard
speech
read
language
music
song
images
and
pictures
all
happen
at
once
so
that
the
meaning
is
multi-dimensional

for
example
if
one
were
to
see
a
cat
in
this
state
it
would
be
communicated
in
many
ways
at
once
one
would
see
a
picture
or
cartoon
of
a
cat
made
out
of
writhing
colorful
strips
or
segments
which
are
words
--
cat
cat
cat
pussy
kitty
pussy
meow
tail
ears
cat
cat
kitty



and
the
picture
would
be
accompanied
by
a
musical
description
of
the
cat
like
peter
and
the
wolf
only
more
descriptive
and
precise
and
by
voices
singing
cat
cat
kitty
kitty
meow
puss
kittycat



which
would
match
the
text

this
time
i
saw
the
elves
as
multidimensional
creatures
formed
by
strands
of
visible
language
they
were
more
creaturely
than
i
had
ever
seen
them
before
the
message
was
changing
from
the
initial
ok
ok
safe
safe




the
word
changing
suggests
that
this
was
a
time-linear
process
i
dont
think
this
is
the
case
i
believe
that
during
the
trance
the
whole
message
and
its
variations
were
there
at
once
from
the
start
there
is
a
different
meaning
to
time
in
the
dmt
state
and
the
notion
of
linear
temporal
order
that
we
usualiy
believe
is
not
valid
or
useful
all
the
information
is
always
immediately
there
and
the
idea
of
linearity
comes
from
our
linear
habits
of
attention
and
the
fact
that
we
do
not
yet
know
how
to
see/hear/perceive
several
messages
simultaneously
and
consciously
so
we
string
them
out
for
perceptual
convenience

the
elves
were
dancing
in
and
out
of
the
multidimensional
visible
language
matrix
waving
their
arms
and
limbs/hands/fingers
and
smiling
or
laughing
although
i
saw
no
faces
as
such
the
elves
were
telling
me
or
i
was
understanding
them
to
say
that
i
had
seen
them
before
in
early
childhood
memories
were
flooding
back
of
seeing
the
elves
they
looked
just
like
they
do
now
evershifting
folding
multidimensional
multicolored
what
colors
always
laughing
weaving/waving
showing
me
things
showing
me
the
visible
language
they
are
created/creatures
of
teaching
me
to
speak
and
read
are
they
are
linguistic
programs
made
manifest
and
personified
this
throws
an
entirely
new
light
on
terence
mckennas
remark
at
esalen
about
language
being
the
most
alien
artifact
we
have

following
is
a
paraphrase
of
the
message
content
--
all
conveyed
in
the
multimedia
way
described
earlier
to
emphasize
the
entire
message
was
conveyed
via
visible
language

they
read-protect
their
contact
with
children
no-no
bye-bye
uh-uh
dont
tell
is
the
phrase
they
used
to
keep
me
from
remembering
or
telling
the
grown-ups
they
come
to
you
when
you
are
a
child
my
younger
brother
and
i
saw
them
when
we
were
very
young
they
lived
under
the
bed
they
played
with
us
but
they
only
came
out
when
our
parents
werent
around
they
showed
us
things
they
showed
us
meaning
and
language
my
brother
say
them
more
clearly
perhaps
because
he
was
younger
then
i
did
they
taught
us
words
-
i
read
earlier
than
normal
because
of
their
help

when
i
was
frightened
or
anxious
i
would
crawl
under
the
bed
to
where
it
was
safe
because
the
elves
were
there
bye-bye
uh-uh
dont
tell
well
be
back
they
used
to
sing

ive
been
seeing
it
all
along
i
thought
the
chysthanthemum
pattern
is
the
elves
is
the
visible
language
is
the
message
however
true
visions
on
dmt
like
those
on
mushrooms
are
different
from
these
patterns
they
are
real
like
seeing
with
normal
vision
more
like
a
movie
or
a
very
vivid
dream
than
like
the
pattern/cartoon/visible
language

the
personal
reality
of
these
creatures
seems
indisputable
during
the
contact
but
that
interpretation
runs
into
my
normal
skepticism
when
i
am
out
of
contact
is
the
notion
that
these
are
beings
merely
the
obvious
interpretation
of
these
phenomena
by
the
human
mind
or
is
something
else
going
on
that
we
can
only
understand
by
interpreting
it
as
an
encounter
with
an
alien
being

the
visible
language
and
the
multidimensional
nature
of
the
forms
seems
so
clear
but
the
relationship
of
these
phenomena
to
me
as
an
individual
and
to
the
human
race
in
a
species-history
sense
is
less
clear
i
am
always
afraid
of
repeating
the
errors
of
misplaced
concreteness
thinking
the
creatures
are
real
and
the
dogmatic
fallacy
thinking
that
i
know
what
i
saw
the
most
honest
answer
is
that
i
dont
know
what
i
saw
do
we
ever
but
that
the
description
above
is
my
attempt
to
communicate
some
of
what
i
thought
i
saw

the
encounter
felt
profound
exhilarating
and
filled
with
warmth
excitement
and
protection
i
was
not
afraid
but
was
comforted
by
the
experience

and
after
the
encounter
had
ended
i
found
my
allergic
symptoms
had
disappeared
i
was
no
longer
agitated
but
felt
calm

the
visible
language
phenomenon
was
most
interesting
--
i
felt
curious
excited
and
peculiarly
self-confident
while
experiencing
it
--
a
childlike
delight
and
a
consuming
desire
to
see
and
know
more
i
only
saw
part
of
what
was
going
on
and
i
only
remember
part
of
what
i
saw
and
i
can
communicate
only
a
little
of
what
i
remember

when
dear
reader
you
have
similar
experiences
try
to
see/perceive
as
much
as
you
can
remember
as
much
as
you
are
able
take
notes
or
talk
into
a
recorder
and
attempt
to
write
down
your
trip
it
is
hard
to
do
the
results
are
always
less
than
you
hope
but
we
must
all
try
to
express
these
things
if
we
are
ever
to
build
a
descriptive
consensus
or
even
a
start
at
understanding

high

looking
for
some
answers<br/>hi
everyone
<br/>im
writing
here
since

i
had
an
uncommon
experience
with
dmt
since
the
last
time
2
months
ago
i
have
a
headache
that
doesnt
go
away
i
have
tried
dmt
around
4
times
the
first
time
i
just
took
10mg
the
second
20mg
the
third
time
was
around
30
mg
and
there
i
had
an
unwanted
effect
that
i
physically
could
identify
as
i
took
the
third
puff
i
had
some
dreamy
hallucinations
without
breaking
through
at
the
same
time
i
had
the
feeling
that
the
left
side
of
my
face
was
slightly
paralyzing
this
feeling
went
away
as
the
effect
from
dmt
left
it
was
an
uncommon
and
uncomfortable
feeling
but
since
it
went
away
i
didnt
give
so
much
importance

two
months
after
i
had
the
feeling
i
was
prepared
for
a
full


dosis
dose
looking
forward
to
breaking
through
i
must
say
as
well
one
week
ago
before
the
experience
i
was
at
a
festival
and
there
i
took
mdma
mushrooms
and
weed
for
two
days

back
to
that
day
of
the
bad
trip
i
smoked
a
joint
3
hours
before
and
then
packed
60mg
in
my
volca
evolve
what
happened
next
was
pretty
scary
at
the
second
puff
it
came
to
the
same
face
feeling
as
before
but
this
time
was
10
times
stronger
extremely
painful
and
i
really
thought
my
head
was
going
to
explode
a
big
feeling
of
paralysis
and
pain
took
over
the
left
side
of
my
face
and
head

a
big
feeling
of
paralysis
and
pain
took
over
the
left
side
of
my
face
and
head

this
was
around
10
seconds
and
then
left
slightly
i
tried
to
breathe
and
calm
down
and
enjoy
the
amazing
visuals
i
was
having
at
the
moment

as
the
whole
effects
from
dmt
went
away
this
pain
on
the
left
side
stayed
the
next
day
i
was
having
strong
headaches
in
my
whole
head
after
one
week
i
went
to
the
doctor
and
told
him
about
everything
he
recommended
an
mri
and
blood
tests
i
came
back
4
weeks
later
with
the
results
and
he
told
me
that
he
did
not
find
anything
wrong


it
has
been
2
months
since
this
experience
and
the
pain
hasnt
left
a
single
moment
since
then
the
left
side
of
my
face
is
feeling
weird
strong
pressure
behind
and
in
the
ear
and
my
eye
my
neck
is
feeling
hard


since
the
doctor
couldnt
give
me
a
certain
answer
about
what
is
happening
to
me
i
would
really
appreciate
the
opinion
or
experience
from
someone
who
has
lived
something
like
this




also
for
2
years
i
have
a
neurological
condition
in
my
back
left
side
the
doctors
say
is
herpes
zoster
i
have
the
feeling
that
this
has
something
to
do
with
my
headache
as
if
the
pain
has
moved


from
place

from
my
back
to
the
head
curiously
the
common
pain
in
my
back
is
almost
gone
since
the
experience


<br/>i
would
be
really
thankful
to
hear
about
your
experiences<br/>thank
you
so
much
and
sorry
for
my
bad
english




i
had
just
gotten
back
from
a
concert
and
i
was
on
the
tail
end
of
2
tabs
of
acid
i
had
also
taken
my
daily
birth
control
pill
as
well
as
75mg
of
adderall
12
hours
prior

i
had
ingested
two
pre-concert
beers
about
5
hours
prior


a
group
of
about
ten
of
us
decided
to
smoke
some
dmt
we
went
into
a
subdued
room
and
prepared
to
dose
most
us
had
used
dmt
before
excepting
the
owner
of
the
pipe
he
was
the
trip
supervisor
in
a
sense
he
loaded
the
pipe
each
time
and
coached
us
individually

after
3
other
people
it
was
my
time
to
dose
i
put
a
thin
glass
pipe
about
one
foot
in
length
up
to
my
lips
and
waited
as
the
supervisor
heated
the
dmt
with
a
torch
lighter
the
pipe
started
clouding
with
smoke
and
once
i
got
the
go-ahead
i
inhaled
the
entire
pipe
in
one
breath
and
held
it
i
exhaled
and
coughed
i
started
seeing
wonderful
patterns

then
i
coughed
again
and
again
people
started
to
ask
if
i
was
ok
the
visuals
were
now
extremely
intense
and
i
was
overwhelmed
with
difficulty
i
managed
to
say
i
feel
like
i
need
to
cough
something
up

somebody
fetched
a
wastebasket
i
felt
like
there
was
something
sharp
lodged
into
the
back
of
my
throat
and
then
i
started
dry
heaving
i
had
an
intense
desire
to
vomit
but
was
unable
to
induce
vomiting
another
person
brought
me
a
glass
of
water
which
i
accepted
gratefully
i
tried
drinking
the
water
but
my
body
seemed
to
reject
that
idea
and
i
heaved
the
water
back
up


i
then
realized
that
something
was
very
wrong
with
my
throat
between
coughs
and
dry
heaves
i
had
never
felt
this
horribly
after
any
drug
before
i
was
extremely
worried
and
between
heaves
and
coughs
i
asked
if
the
paramedics
should
be
called
i
had
never
seen
anyone
react
this
way
to
drugs
before
and
terrifyingly
it
was
me
having
the
reaction
the
visuals
were
just
a
distraction
to
an
overwhelming
sense
both
physical
and
mental
that
something
had
gone
horribly
wrong


the
group
became
concerned
but
no
calls
to
the
paramedics
were
made
people
surrounded
me
in
support
rubbing
my
back
and
doing
what
they
could
to
make
me
feel
more
comfortable
my
windpipe
felt
extremely
distressed
and
each
time
i
swallowed
or
coughed
the
pain
was
excruciating
gradually
however
the
pain
diminished
after
about
10
minutes
i
could
ingest
water
again
with
some
pain
about
20
minutes
after
i
dosed
i
became
convinced
that
i
was
going
to
be
ok

my
throat
and
lungs
remained
very
sore
for
at
least
5
hours
after
dosing

reflecting
on
my
experience
i
wonder
if
the
vapor
had
been
too
hot
and
had
burned
my
throat
i
would
be
willing
to
experience
dmt
again
sometime
in
the
future




i
have
decided
to
write
a
trip
report
for
reasons
that
are
twofold

for
one
i
do
wish
to
warn
others
of
some
of
the
complications
i
experienced
on
this
drug

i
have
read
many
trip
reports
and
done
a
lot
of
research
plus
have
personally
experimented
with
it
in
the
past
and
i
believe
what
happened
to
me
is
less
common

i
believe
what
happened
to
me
is
less
common


second
part
of
my
reason
for
writing
this
is
selfish

i
desperately
need
a
way
to
help
integrate
this
experience
to
move
forward
with
my
life
and
i
this
is
an
attempt
at
doing
just
that

background

i
am
a
33
y/o
female
who
is
quite
experienced
with
psychedelics

i
really
enjoy
marijuana
lsd
mushrooms
ketamine
mdma
2cb
combinations
of
the
aforementioned
substances
etc

prior
to
the
experience
i
am
about
to
share
i
had
smoked
dmt
approximately
15-20
times
but
usually
out
of
a
vape
pen
which
cuts
me
off
before
i
can
really
get
a
blast
off
dose
if
you
will

some
of
those
trips
were
really
cool
and
some
were
scary
but
never
so
frightening
it
turned
me
away
from
my
pursuit
of
crystal
dmt
i
spent
years
looking
for
it
and
3
weeks
ago
i
finally
found
it

my
husband
and
i
bought
a
gram
and
partook
in
a
few
small
trips
working
up
the
courage
to
take
that
blast
off
dose

the
set
up

4
days
ago
at
aprox
1500
we
decided
it
was
time
to
try
to
travel
to
another
dimension
and
meet
these
entities
we
keep
hearing
about

i
invited
2
of
our
friends
over
k
and
p

we
used
our
rig
to
dab
the
dmt
p
went
first
and
blew
her
40
mg
hit
out
immediately
through
her
nose

accordingly
she
had
a
fun
experience
in
which
she
was
still
able
to
communicate
with
us

k
went
next
and
did
a
smaller
dose
and
came
back
10
minutes
later
sharing
about
all
the
amazing
visuals
she
had
seen
and
love
she
had
felt


my
husband
decided
to
go
last
so
finally
the
moment
i
had
waited
for
it
was
my
turn

my
husband
got
the
rig
ready
and
poured
in
40
mg
of
dimitri

i
inhaled
it
all
and
laid
back
on
the
couch

some
gramatik
song
was
playing
i
cannot
remember
which
as
i
held
in
the
smoke
i
closed
my
eyes
and
began
to
see
hazy
dull
colors
and
patterns

i
thought
to
myself
this
isn\t
really
working
and
let
the
smoke
out

i
started
to
say
to
my
husband
i
needed
more
hah
yeah
right
but
i
couldn\t
get
it
out

what
happened
next
is
a
it
of
a
blur
but
this
is
my
best
recollection

the
trip
all
of
a
sudden
bright
neon
elaborate
patterns
spirals
and
jester-like
clown
people
filled
my
vision
i
was
already
terrified
and
could
not
understand
what
was
going
on

it
is
difficult
to
find
words
in
the
english
language
to
describe
a
true
dmt
trip
but
this
is
the
only
way
i
can
think
to
describe
it

it
felt
like
one
of
the
jester
creatures
grabbed
me
from
behind
and
then
grabbed
my
upper
lip
stretching
and
pulling
it
over
my
head
turning
my
face
inside
out

i
found
it
difficult
to
breath

at
this
point
i
was
still
laying
down
with
my
eyes
closed
he
the
jester
felt
like
a
male
to
me
for
some
reason
then
slammed
me
face
first
into
the
couch
and
then
pulled
me
back
up
and
tore
both
my
eye
lids
open
forcing
me
to
take
in
the
insane
psychedelia
before
me

my
husband
and
friends
said
at
one
point
i
bolted
up
to
a
sitting
position
with
my
eyes
wide
open
darting
rapidly
around
the
room

i
think
this
coincides
with
the
feeling
of
having
my
eyes
torn
open
and
being
forced
to
watch
this
horror
unfold


the
words
i
was
hearing
in
my
head
were
you
think
you
can
play
with
us
you
little
b****

i
couldn\t
understand
what
was
going
on
or
what
i
had
done
to
get
treated
like
this

i
don\t
even
think
i
knew
who
i
was
but
i
definitely
knew
something
was
horribly
wrong


the
next
thing
i
remember
is
feeling
like
this
jester
had
stuck
jagged
plastic
down
my
throat
and
i
was
choking
to
death

outwardly
my
husband
and
friends
said
i
had
started
gagging
and
this
is
when
they
became
concerned

looking
back
i
am
sure
the
taste
of
plastic
and
the
harshness
of
the
smoke
is
what
led
to
this
feeling
but
when
you
are
that
high
you
have
zero
ability
to
rationalize
this

the
gagging
turned
into
me
spitting
all
over
the
couch
and
my
husband
said
it
looked
like
i
was
about
to
throw
up

instead
of
throwing
up
i
tried
to
stand
up
according
to
my
loved
ones
who
got
me
to
sit
back
down
and
began
crying
out
help
help
help
help
over
and
over

the
jester
continued
to
choke
me
and
i
felt
like
i
was
loosing
the
battle

i
started
saying
i
can\t
breathe
i
can\t
breathe


finally
the
trip
began
to
release
its
grip
and
i
could
hear
voices
that
were
familiar
but
the
most
familiar
voice
i
could
finally
hear
was
my
own

i
heard
myself
begging
for
help
and
asking
how
to
breathe

i
heard
myself
begging
for
help
and
asking
how
to
breathe

my
husband
said
i
even
said
help
me
you
guys
and
he
said
that
notified
him
that
i
was
coming
back
because
i
had
some
concept
that
my
loved
ones
were
there

i
slowly
came
out
of
it
and
as
i
was
coming
back
that
jester
character
was
surrounded
by
beautiful
colors
and
patterns
and
he
was
kind
of
dancing
and
smiling
and
laughing
saying
come
again
little
girl

we\ll
be
waiting
and
other
eerie
stuff
like
that
when
i
finally
completely
came
to
i
saw
3
very
scared
people
surrounding
me
rubbing
my
back
telling
me
i
was
ok
and
i
was
safe

i
had
no
idea
why
they
were
telling
me
this
and
i
turned
to
my
husband
and
said
what\s
going
on
what\s
happening
to
me

he
replied
babe
you
did
dmt

i
began
to
cry

the
whole
experience
was
only
about
5
minutes
possibly
less
which
is
short
even
for
dmt
i
was
later
told

it
felt
like
a
life
time

the
aftermath
it
is
4
days
later

the
trip
is
very
difficult
to
remember
visually
but
the
feelings
are
not

i
can
still
feel
that
jagged
plastic
in
my
throat
im
assuming
i
must
have
burned
it
or
something

i
still
feel
sick
to
my
stomach

i
still
feel
anxiety
and
fear

i
had
to
leave
work
early
the
other
day
and
begged
my
husband
to
leave
work
too
because
i
was
anxious
and
scared
and
felt
like
the
only
safe
place
for
me
in
this
world
was
with
him

i
sincerely
feel
traumatized

the
main
entity
i
saw
was
mean
he
was
maniacal
taunting
violent
and
aggressive

i
feel
like
i
am
on
the
verge
of
a
panic
attack
writing
this
out

my
takeaways
when
i
started
this
i
said
i
wanted
to
warn
others

and
i
dont
mean
about
the
intense
hallucinations
or
entities

i
have
heard
of
horrible
trips
and
i
did
know
it
was
possible
even
likely

i
guess
i
didnt
realize
it
could
ever
be
that
aggressive
of
a
hallucination
but
hey
its
dmt
anything
can
happen
when
you
enter
that
realm

i
was
in
that
entitys
world
and
it
had
its
way
with
me



what
i
really
want
people
to
be
mindful
of
is
that
dmt
can
be
physically
dangerous


you
always
hear
i
always
heard
things
like
youe
so
high
you
can\t
keep
your
eyes
open
and
you
can\t
move
you
just
lay
there

well
news
flash
i
did
both
and
i
could
have
hurt
myself
trying
to
stand
up
like
that
if
my
friends
and
husband
had
not
been
there

i
could
have
hurt
myself
trying
to
stand
up
like
that
if
my
friends
and
husband
had
not
been
there

i
didnt
read
about
people
almost
choking
or
throwing
up
on
it
until
i
started
to
research
it
after
my
experience
and
even
then
there
is
not
a
lot
of
information
on
this
side
effect

perhaps
because
it
doesnt
happen
often
but
it
can
happen



if
you
are
going
to
do
this
drug
i
would
have
a
sitter

someone
who
can
help
you
get
sit
back
down
or
throw
up
safely



i
wont
ever
touch
this
substance
again
and
i
probably
wont
consume
any
form
of
psychedelic
until
i
am
able
to
integrate
this
experience




i
live
in
a
town
where
not
a
whole
lot
goes
on
its
a
dead
valley
with
hot
summers
and
cold
winters
and
there
isnt
really
anything
to
do
most
kids
my
age
find
enjoyment
in
this
valley
resorting
to
drugs
alcohol
and
partying


when
dmt
became
available
to
me
through
one
of
my
friends
i
was
anxious
to
try
it
i
had
never
tried
a
hallucinogen
before
and
i
had
planned
on
taking
acid
one
random
weekday
during
my
spring
break
my
friend
and
i
were
on
my
couch
downstairs
watching
tv
waiting
for
my
acid
to
kick
in
it
had
been
exactly
an
hour
since
i
dropped
my
two
tabs
415
they
went
in
and
510
on
my
couch
he
looked
at
me
and
asked
me
if
i
wanted
to
smoke
dmt
i
said
no
but
the
tabs
had
dissolved
by
that
time
and
we
were
now
waiting
for
my
acid
trip
to
begin
he
said
if
i
smoked
weed
with
my
acid
it
would
make
my
trip
intense
i
thanked
him
for
the
free
bowl
and
let
him
pack
it

he
loaded
our
bong
with
a
base
of
weed
and
sprinkled
dmt
on
top
then
packed
some
more
weed
on
top
to
cover
it
up
not
really
feeling
too
nervous
more
excited
to
enhance
my
trip
actually
i
took
the
hit
i
killed
the
bowl
entirely
and
held
it
in
little
did
i
know
until
i
held
the
hit
did
he
pack
two
and
a
half
doses
of
dmt
into
that
bowl
i
had
wondered
why
the
taste
was
so
bitter
and
had
gotten
such
a
harsh
hit

within
milliseconds
i
began
to
experience
a
tingling
sensation
throughout
my
entire
body
the
world
around
me
turned
extremely
bright
almost
as
if
to
turn
the
brightness
setting
on
a
tv
all
the
way
up
the
volume
of
life
became
so
high
that
it
turned
to
just
noise
and
i
couldnt
even
make
out
what
i
was
hearing
i
finally
breathed
out
the
world
turned
darker
than
before
i
had
smoked
as
my
breath
left
my
body
i
felt
it
extend
outward
as
if
the
air
was
attached
to
my
lungs
in
some
sort
of
way
it
was
almost
impossible
to
breathe
and
honestly
i
dont
remember
doing
it
i
looked
around
the
room
and
watched
objects
magnify
and
furniture
distort
and
disappear
then
i
remembered
i
had
the
bong
in
my
hand
and
i
put
it
on
my
coffee
table
from
this
point
the
entire
world
around
me
turned
many
different
shades
of
the
color
red
this
is
where
my
nightmare
began

i
thought
i
had
smashed
the
bong
on
my
table
and
cut
my
hand
open
as
i
felt
a
very
warm
liquid
on
my
hand
with
the
bong
as
i
placed
it
on
the
table
i
went
immediately
to
look
at
my
hand
and
i
watched
my
fingers
disappear
from
my
hand
then
i
watched
my
feet
disappear
from
my
legs
then
my
arm
from
my
body
i
freaked
out
and
started
to
feel
parts
of
my
body
to
see
if
they
were
still
there
i
touched
my
chest
my
arm
and
then
my
leg
my
friend
stood
up
at
this
point
and
asked
me
what
the
hell
i
was
doing
and
this
only
made
everything
worse
i
actually
thought
i
had
ripped
the
limbs
off
of
my
body
and
peeled
flesh
away
from
bone
at
this
point
i
literally
accepted
death
because
i
thought
i
was
dying
i
thought
i
had
ripped
my
skin
and
body
parts
off
because
i
was
tripping
so
hard

i
thought
i
had
ripped
my
skin
and
body
parts
off
because
i
was
tripping
so
hard

then
i
blacked
out
and
remember
looking
at
my
friend
while
i
was
sitting
in
the
same
place
on
my
couch
i
couldnt
move
and
felt
like
every
bone
in
my
body
was
broken
i
thought
i
was
dead
and
that
i
could
see
the
world
around
me
still
looking
around
i
realized
i
was
tripping
harder
than
i
ever
imagined
i
could
shapes
that
i
couldnt
draw
or
explain
were
floating
in
midair
every
material
thing
inside
my
house
disassembled
and
floated
in
midair
my
tv
screen
zoomed
out
at
me
and
took
over
my
entire
field
of
vision
i
just
wanted
it
to
be
over
at
this
point
i
wanted
to
wake
up

i
looked
at
my
hand
again
remembering
how
i
thought
i
smashed
the
bong
and
saw
my
watch
was
a
snake
so
i
took
it
off
i
took
my
wallet
and
phone
out
of
my
pockets
too
and
placed
them
on
the
table
and
took
my
shoes
off
and
sat
down
i
then
asked
my
friend
if
everything
was
okay
he
said
yes
i
asked
if
i
broke
the
bong
he
said
no
i
asked
if
i
spilled
bongwater
he
said
no
i
asked
how
long
it
had
been
he
said
one
minute
and
fifteen
seconds

i
then
looked
outside
and
thought
if
anything
i
wanted
to
be
where
it
was
bright
and
shiny
where
i
could
see
the
sun
and
try
to
be
happy
i
put
my
watch
and
shoes
back
on
and
then
took
my
phone
and
wallet
and
walked
outside
into
my
backyard
my
shins
felt
like
they
werent
there
and
every
step
i
took
was
like
walking
on
water
the
ground
became
distorted
and
almost
goo
like
where
ever
i
placed
my
feet
still
peaking
i
walked
outside
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
around
my
table
he
followed
me
out
and
we
sat
outside
while
i
looked
at
the
still
extremely
insane
yet
mild
hallucinogens
compared
to
what
i
had
seen
while
inside
on
my
couch
looking
up
at
the
sky
i
couldnt
tell
whether
it
was
cloudy
or
sunny
all
i
know
was
it
was
brighter
outside
i
asked
him
what
i
did
and
he
told
me
i
was
calm
and
breathing
just
fine
the
entire
time
i
had
no
fast
sudden
movements
and
didnt
seem
as
if
in
a
panic
at
all
i
talked
just
fine
and
seemed
close
to
perfectly
normal
at
this
point
every
brick
on
my
brick
wall
was
a
tiki
head
and
they
were
all
talking
to
me
i
was
ready
for
the
hallucinations
to
be
over
i
wanted
to
wake
up
from
my
horrible
nightmare
but
time
was
the
only
thing
that
would
help
i
asked
him
at
this
point
how
long
it
had
been
and
he
said
two
minutes
and
thirty
seconds

as
my
friend
finished
his
cigarette
we
walked
back
inside
and
upstairs
to
chill
and
watch
some
tv
i
dont
remember
the
next
twenty
seven
and
a
half
minutes
of
my
life

i
do
remember
each
horrible
visual
i
witnessed
each
feeling
i
had
the
sound
of
life
during
my
nightmare
and
most
of
all
my
acceptance
of
death
i
had
relived
this
nightmare
every
single
night
for
about
two
months
straight
and
even
experienced
another
dream
that
recalled
every
same
feeling
i
had
while
on
dmt
only
in
a
different
nightmare

insomnia
and
paranoia
followed
for
a
very
long
time
as
well
i
didnt
sleep
for
that
night
and
got
about
four
or
so
hours
of
sleep
for
every
night
after
that
until
about
a
month
ago
i
began
to
become
a
captive
in
my
room
because
i
was
afraid
that
if
i
opened
doors
i
wouldnt
find
behind
them
what
i
thought
was
really
there
i
didnt
sit
in
that
same
place
on
my
couch
for
the
next
day

i
dont
recommend
this
substance
at
all
it
was
and
might
remain
the
most
horrible
and
terrifying
experience
of
my
entire
life
the
visuals
i
cant
explain
to
anyone
and
no
words
even
come
close
the
feeling
of
acceptance
of
death
hasnt
gone
away
and
i
remember
it
completely
when
i
had
heard
you
die
on
dmt
and
come
back
to
life
i
didnt
know
it
would
be
in
that
way




my
background
in
hallucinogens
is
quite
extensive
having
tried
many
different
psychedelics
at
high
doses
including
smoking
nn
dmt
multiple
times
daily
for
at
least
a
month
of
my
life

it
was
a
earlier
month
in
the
year
of
2009
and
my
friend
who
i
will
call
f
had
acquired
a
milligram
scale
i
was
very
excited
because
we
had
been
sitting
on
the
supplies
to
make
ourselves
a
dose
of
pharmahuasca
for
quite
some
time
he
and
i
had
prepared
for
the
night
and
planned
to
have
limited
interruptions


f
and
i
weigh
out
the
proportions
of
the
dmt
to
be
140mg
per
pill
and
around
150mg
of
banisteriopsis
caapi
and
peganum
harmala
the
setting
is
fs
house
which
is
a
ranch
style
home
in
a
neighborhood
in
the
local
city
the
home
has
not
been
remodeled
since
the
1970s
and
creates
a
very
trippy
vibe
another
note
to
mention
is
that
i
had
fasted
for
the
previous
24
hours
and
f
had
not


the
experience
f
and
i
are
both
very
excited
to
have
our
first
experience
on
pharmahuasca
be
an
absolutely
crazy
experience
we
both
love
to
trip
and
do
so
together
very
often
at
this
point
in
time
the
time
building
up
to
the
trip
we
both
calm
ourselves
physically
and
mentally
and
prepare
a
mix
of
light
trance
and
psychedelic
music
once
everything
is
prepared
we
ingest
our
two
pills
that
we
have
put
our
materials
into


t000
ingest
the
two
pills
previously
mentioned
t2000
no
real
effects
felt
thus
far
f
and
i
both
feel
perhaps
we
have
not
eaten
enough
so
we
both
fill
a
capsule
entirely
with
nn
dmt
and
swallow
it
as
well

t4000
i
feel
somewhat
sick
to
my
stomach
and
i
am
starting
to
feel
anxious
i
go
to
use
the
restroom
at
this
point

t4500
i
am
in
the
bathroom
sitting
on
the
toilet
and
the
oevs
begin
i
am
having
a
good
time
and
enjoying
the
trip
thus
far
t5500
i
am
still
sitting
on
the
toilet
and
having
a
hard
time
grasping
what
is
going
on
i
am
tripping
at
this
point
i
would
rate
it
at
++/+++

t105
i
have
managed
to
make
it
out
of
the
bathroom
and
into
fs
room
and
i
lie
on
his
bed
f
has
yet
to
start
tripping
and
i
believe
this
was
due
to
my
fasting
and
he
had
just
eaten

t110
i
am
tripping
hard
its
getting
to
be
+++
levels
it
is
at
this
point
that
i
realize
that
i
am
just
starting
the
come
up
from
the
first
two
pills
and
the
third
pill
probably
has
not
kicked
in
at
this
point
i
think
to
myself
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
ruff
night

t135
i
am
tripping
at
what
would
only
be
described
as
++++
i
feel
a
rush
of
nausea
and
decide
i
need
to
go
to
the
bathroom
how
i
put
the
two
together
and
this
point
is
still
unknown
to
me
i
make
it
to
the
guest
bathroom
with
great
difficulty
i
try
to
open
the
door
and
it
does
not
open
i
try
harder
and
finally
it
comes
open
f
was
in
the
bathroom
and
the
door
was
locked
i
push
him
out
of
the
way
and
make
it
to
the
toilet
i
start
vomiting
uncontrollably


t140
i
am
still
vomiting
and
i
am
not
really
making
much
of
the
vomit
into
the
toilet
the
toilet
is
contorting
into
geometric
patterns
that
are
familiar
with
dmt
my
vomit
appears
to
be
robotic
worms
of
some
sort
swirling
around
in
the
toilet
i
keep
telling
myself
its
only
my
mind
and
i
am
going
to
be
ok


t150
i
am
tripping
so
hard
that
i
am
freaking
out
i
am
whiting
out
and
truly
feeling
fear
at
this
point
what
have
i
done
i
want
this
to
stop
at
this
point
i
fear
that
i
have
eaten
poison
by
mistake
f
who
is
still
at
around
a
++
level
tells
me
later
that
i
am
convulsing
on
the
floor
rolling
around
in
my
own
vomit
i
tell
him
to
make
it
stop
i
tell
him
that
i
want
this
to
be
over
i
ask
for
some
antipsychotic
to
bring
me
down
please
f
help
me
i
ask
him
if
i
am
dying
and
his
amorphous
blob
of
a
figure
says
no
but
i
sense
fear
in
his
voice
i
repeat
the
question
accompanied
this
time
with
why
am
i
so
sick
i
think
i
am
dying
i
tell
f
to
call
my
parents
and
my
girlfriend
and
tell
them
that
i
am
dying
f
repeats
this
back
to
me
as
a
question
but
i
cannot
understand
what
noises
this
thing
is
making


during
this
time
i
lay
on
the
floor
floating
in
and
out
of
consciousness
it
is
during
this
time
that
the
most
profound
experience
comes
into
play
i
am
all
of
the
sudden
out
of
my
body
in
a
way
similar
to
smoking
dmt
but
more
intense
i
go
out
into
a
black
nothingness
and
i
am
accompanied
by
three
other
beings
of
unknown
descent
we
all
are
sitting
with
our
legs
crossed
atop
our
own
ball
of
energy
the
seats
we
were
posted
on
seem
to
be
the
hue
of
a
dark
reddish
orange
and
the
beings
were
a
bluish
green
hue
all
of
the
objects
had
the
lines
of
geometric
patterns
that
are
associated
with
smoking
dmt
the
energy
pulses
in
the
objects
in
front
of
me
and
the
rest
of
my
field
of
vie
which
was
around
270
degrees
is
pitch
black
i
communicate
with
the
beings
via
telepathy
and
they
are
very
friendly
and
intelligent
beyond
my
miniscule
levels
of
comprehension
the
beings
start
streaming
knowledge
into
my
mind
memories
of
things
past
that
are
very
clear
and
understandable
i
watch
through
their
eyes
as
the
universe
is
created
and
the
evolution
of
planets
not
only
planets
i
know
but
ones
i
do
not
with
species
that
i
have
never
seen
or
imagined
i
wonder
what
all
of
this
means
not
having
any
faith
in
deities
of
any
sort
i
wonder
if
thats
what
these
creatures
are
whatever
these
unknown
entities
are
they
are
superior
to
humans
by
unknown
orders
of
magnitude


after
i
am
with
them
for
what
seems
like
an
eternity
the
beings
bid
farewell
and
i
am
sent
hurdling
back
down
to
earth
i
am
not
sent
back
to
fs
bathroom
rather
i
arrive
at
a
temple
that
seems
mayan
aztec
and
incan
in
origin
the
structure
is
made
of
energy
rather
than
stone
similar
in
design
to
the
aforementioned
energy
balls
that
the
unknown
beings
and
i
rested
upon
i
approach
the
temple
and
there
are
guards
made
of
energy
similar
to
that
of
the
balls
the
guards
seem
to
be
20
feet
tall
and
dressed
as
incan
warriors
with
square
heads
and
large
ears
with
large
hoops
inside
the
lobe
the
guards
have
strange
spear/sword
weapons
i
have
never
seen
before
i
try
to
pass
the
guards
and
they
stop
me
they
communicate
with
me
telepathically
just
as
the
beings
from
before
had
however
the
tone
these
creatures
use
is
not
friendly
the
leader
of
the
guards
tells
me
that
i
cannot
enter
the
temple
yet
the
temple
contained
all
knowledge
and
i
would
not
understand
it
he
also
said
that
once
i
entered
the
temple
that
i
could
never
return
to
where
i
had
come
from


t245
i
come
to
and
f
is
standing
over
me
i
am
somewhat
scared
and
i
ask
him
what
the
fuck
is
going
on
he
smiles
lightly
and
says
your
tripping
real
hard
and
laughs

t250
f
convinces
me
that
i
am
fine
and
coaxes
me
to
change
from
my
vomit
covered
clothes
and
come
out
to
the
living
room

t255
i
have
a
moment
lasting
around
10
minutes
where
my
head
is
completely
clear
and
i
tell
f
what
i
saw
we
go
outside
and
smoke
a
cigarette
and
return
inside
because
of
the
cold
weather
outside

t305
i
start
tripping
wildly
again
but
i
maintain
consciousness
and
talk
to
f
during
this
part
of
trip
i
am
still
lost
at
this
point
and
ask
f
to
explain
to
me
what
i
am
and
lots
of
other
questions
concerning
human
activity
f
is
starting
to
approach
the
level
i
was
experiencing
earlier
so
he
does
not
respond
much
rather
stares
at
his
pants
for
the
next
60
minutes

t405
at
this
point
i
am
around
a
+++
and
i
am
enjoying
myself
as
compared
to
what
has
just
happened
i
listen
to
music
and
watch
cartoons
t640
the
trip
is
dwindling
down
and
i
feel
tired
i
go
to
sleep
and
wake
up
the
next
day
with
no
ill
effects
on
my
body
other
than
a
completely
confused
mind


in
conclusion
this
was
the
scariest
experience
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
but
i
survived
with
a
great
story
to
tell
had
f
not
been
there
to
help
me
i
think
it
could
have
been
much
worse
always
have
a
friend
and
a
safe
environment




this
trip
report
is
to
highlight
the
possible
danger
of
combining
changa
and
syrian
rue
i
am
quite
an
experienced
tripper
having
taken
lsd
mushrooms
ecstasy
ayahuasca
and
a
number
of
non
psychedelic
drugs

i
have
eaten
10
grams
of
mushrooms
a
number
of
times
as
well
as
eating
entire
sheets
of
lsd

my
experience
with
the
combination
of
syrian
rue
changa
and
dmt
was
clearly
physiologically
dangerous
i
do
not
recommend
it

after
a
number
of
experiences
with
syrian
rue
i
will
no
longer
be
using
it

it
does
not
have
the
same
\x93guardian
qualities
as
caapi
vine
used
in
traditional
ayahuasca




1200-
after
lightly
boil
19g
of
syrian
rue
for
35
minutes
i
drink
the
syrian
rue
1245-
i
ingest
the
changa
and
dmt
spice
the
spice
is
orange
i
had
packed
them
into
capsules
1330-
begin
noticing
signs
of
dmt
working

the
effect
is
markedly
different
from
ayahuasca
or
smoked
dmt


1345
begin
feeling
nauseous
start
to
feel
strong
effects
of
dmt
quite
wild
and
uncontrolled
in
comparison
to
ayahuasca
vaporise
some
cannabis

1410
vomit
violently
1420
vomit
violently
again
1430
am
unable
to
urinate
and
am
beginning
to
feel
that
something
has
gone
seriously
wrong

1445
i
realise
that
my
body
is
being
poisoned
by
something
i
ingested
i
have
the
sense
that
the
syrian
rue
being
an
maoi-a
is
inhibiting
the
enzyme
necessary
for
the
breaking
down
of
this
toxic
chemical

1500
i
lied
down
on
the
bed
and
began
to
hum
tonic
dominant
tonic
musicians
will
understand
i
had
the
sense
that
i
was
being
given
a
tool
to
enable
me
to
hold
on
to
something
as
my
body
fought
the
toxin

by
this
point
my
lips
have
turned
blue
and
i
am
breathing
with
difficulty

there
is
a
burning
sensation
in
my
kidneys
and
i
am
unable
to
urinate

my
lips
have
turned
blue
and
i
am
breathing
with
difficulty

there
is
a
burning
sensation
in
my
kidneys
and
i
am
unable
to
urinate



1505
i
realise
that
my
body
is
creating
spit
to
dry
and
digest
whatever
is
causing
it
so
much
trouble
but
is
unable
create
the
enzyme
due
to
the
syrian
rue

i
ask
my
girlfriend
who
is
sober
to
spit
into
a
glass
in
order
for
me
to
drink
it
and
hopefully
use
her
enzymes
to
digest
the
changa
i
also
have
a
bit
of
water
and
some
active
yoghurt

1510
i
sit
down
and
began
to
sound
the
aum
om
loudly
focusing
on
the
solar
plexus
to
throat
to
lips
and
circulating
the
microcosmic
orbit
in
order
to
facilitate
urinating
and
reestablish
proper
kidney
and
liver
function
1530
i
finally
urinate
i
return
back
to
baseline
over
several
hours

in
summary
i
recognise
the
feeling
of
my
liver
and
kidneys
beginning
to
fail
as
i
have
experienced
it
on
an
overdose
of
ecstasy

i
faced
a
real
danger
of
death
or
permanent
damage
to
my
organs
if
i
had
not
had
some
experience
of
facing
death
or
if
my
girlfriend
had
not
been
there
i
believe
that
i
would
have
panicked
and
not
taken
the
necessary
measures
to
save
my
life

i
cannot
stress
enough
that
the
danger
was
physiologically
real
unlike
with
lsd
or
psilocybin
mushrooms
syrian
rue
does
not
seem
to
have
the
depth
or
protective
qualities
of
more
traditional
maoi
plants

i
and
others
round
me
have
used
it
with
mushrooms
and
experienced
negative
effects
as
well




the
very
first
time
i
smoked
dmt
i
was
with
2
very
close
friends
whom
i
respect
and
love
very
much
we
were
house-sitting
this
beautiful
place
with
warm
decorating
and
great
ambient
music
playing
over
the
excelent
b&o
soundsystem
the
reason
of
our
gathering
was
to
try
pharmahuasca
a
synthesized
form
of
ayahuasca

bring
hither
the
pills

pharmahuasca
is
a
2-component
psychoactive
substance
first
we
ingested
the
mao-inhibitors
we
waited
about
30
minutes
for
the
pill
to
do
their
thing
and
then
we
ingested
the
actual
pharmahuasca
pills
we
were
not
quite
sure
what
to
expect
since
it
was
a
novelty
for
all
of
us
are
you
feeling
something
special
hmm
yes
feels
a
bit
like
mushrooms
lets
wait
and
see

this
continued
for
another
hour
or
so
all
of
us
feeling
something
but
not
what
we
hoped
for
nor
expected
so
my
friend
thought
it
was
time
to
extend
the
experience
a
little
and
he
pullled
out
a
little
bag
with
this
orange
stuff
and
asked
if
weve
ever
smoked
dmt
well
its
not
like
you
can
buy
this
stuff
at
your
local
drugstore
i
asked
him
what
the
effects
were
how
long
it
took
etc
at
that
time
i
never
did
lsd
but
my
other
friend
assured
me
that
id
enjoy
it
being
the
natural
tripper
and
lucid
dreamer
that
you
are
i
put
my
nose
in
the
bag
and
it
smelled
very
sweat
very
natural
so
i
was
convinced

lets
do
it

so
he
takes
out
his
glass
pipe
and
explains
to
me
that
freebase
smoking
is
the
best
way
to
do
it
however
i
ask
him
to
roll
a
joint
with
it
so
i
am
on
familiar
grounds
he
puts
in
some
miniscule
pieces
of
orange
wax
carefully
placing
them
in
toke-sequence
telling
me
that
this
stuff
is
probably
more
expensive
then
gold
and
gives
me
a
wise-ass
smile
he
says
that
he
loves
us
and
that
he
is
happy
to
share
this
holy
moment
with
us
us
being
there
and
then
was
no
coincedence
it
was
meant
to
be
be
we
all
felt
like
that

and
then
he
lights
it
he
takes
a
good
puff
then
another
and
smilingly
passes
the
joint
to
my
other
friend
who
takes
a
deep
one
or
two
as
well
he
passes
the
joint
to
me
i
take
the
joint
from
him
take
a
deep
hiss
and
hold
my
breath
as
long
as
i
can

immediately
there
is
a
noise
like
an
oscilator
that
starts
as
a
low
zoom
going
higher
and
higer
louder
and
louder
yeah
baby
pitch
me
up
at
the
same
time
a
tingling
feeling
that
starts
in
the
lowest
part
of
my
spine
shoots
up
to
my
forehead
and
countless
beautiful
butterflies
are
coming
into
my
vision
the
higher
the
tone
the
more
colorful
butterflies
are
filling
my
head
my
heart
my
whole
body
i
think
i
just
died
oops
and
that
im
on
my
way
heaven
then
i
hear
a
funny
toiiiinnnk
and
i
am
there

i
had
left
my
body
&
ego
my
memories
morales
and
fears
and
i
had
entered
nirwana
i
was
home
flying
through
a
multidimensional
place
of
pure
vision
and
thought
i
saw
endless
arches
of
golden
salamanders
flowing
through
the
very
fabric
of
space
&
time
their
colors
changing
and
rotating
like
countless
kaleidoscopes
smiling
and
looking
at
me
my
form
and
vision
were
shifting
all
the
time
and
i
saw
countless
non-defined
being
animals
flowers
trees
jewels
and
crystals
while
the
salamanders
were
telling
and
showing
me
the
secret
of
life
heavenly
music
harp-strings
and
choirs
ad
infinitum
were
caressing
my
mental
g-spot
there
were
no
questions
anymore
all
was
answered
and
there
was
eternal
unity
i
was
omnipotent
i
was
the
universe
and
the
universe
laughed
and
laughed
about
itself
and
the
joke
of
life
it
pulled
on
it
the
most
beautiful
place
in
the
universe
and
i
had
found
it
its
soooo
sweat
soooo
beautifull
and
loving
its
magic

in
the
mean
time

in
the
mean
time
starting
about
five
seconds
after
i
smoked
the
dmt-joint
i
had
fainted
and
lost
my
consciousness
luckily
i
was
already
lying
down
we
come
prepared
so
i
didnt
injure
myself
i
have
fainted
before
i
cant
stand
the
sight
of
blood
and
when
i
faint
im
also
in
this
gorgeous
place
of
holy
bliss
a
bit
similar
to
the
dmt-trip
imagine
my
luck
when
i
see
blood
or
get
an
injection
i
naturally
trip-out

my
body
started
twitching
my
eyes
were
closed
and
i
didnt
respond
to
stimuli
from
the
outside
world
anymore
instantly
my
2
friends
snapped
out
of
their
own
trip
and
panicked
over
my
jerking
body
first
they
tried
to
put
me
in
an
upright
position
and
then
they
set
me
on
my
feet
both
embracing
me
in
what
must
have
seemed
a
freak
group-hug
shaking
me
around
and
shouting
my
name
at
me
asking
me
to
please
come
back

whats
happening

after
what
seemed
an
eternity
but
actually
was
7-10
minutes
my
dmt-fairies
suddenly
started
to
vanish
and
the
colors
seemed
to
get
sucked
in
an
invisible
black
hole
this
void
that
i
seemed
to
be
in
started
warping
in
strange
colors
and
patterns
like
dna-strands
emerging
from
a
singularity
and
from
some
distant
place
or
time
i
heard
shouting
getting
louder
and
louder
what
is
this
noise
and
why
and
why
doesnt
it
stop
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
realize
there
is
an
i
and
an
outside
world
where
my
body
of
the
physical
realm
resides
and
that
i
need
to
get
back
to
earth
slowly
the
visual
warps
are
merging
with
the
sounds
and
sights
of
normality
and
see
two
friends
screaming
like
idiots
in
my
face
this
is
certainly
not
the
homecoming
i
had
imagined
when
i
see
my
friends
freak
out
i
assume
something
must
have
gone
terribly
wrong
and
i
freak
out
too
get
me
out
of
this
make
it
stop

my
friends
keep
hugging
me
telling
me
everything
is
going
to
be
alright
not
to
worry
that
they
love
me
and
that
it
will
wear
off
in
a
minute
or
so
slowly
i
start
believing
them
experienced
tripsters
they
are
and
all
the
terror-thoughts
start
to
fade
away
then
im
back
my
head
and
my
stomach
hurt
a
little
and
i
have
a
minor
buzz
in
my
ears

both
my
friends
look
at
me
in
utter
amazement
and
relief
both
saying
that
they
have
never
seen
anything
alike
and
that
they
thought
i
had
oded
or
something
knowing
nobody
ever
oded
from
dmt
they
knew
that
i
faint
sometimes
but
this
was
beyond
any
expectation
at
a
time
least
expected

alles
vergängliche
ist
nur
ein
gleichnis
das
unzulängliche
hier
wirds
ereignis
das
unbeschreibliche
hier
ists
getan
das
ewig-weibliche
zieht
uns
hinan
faust

i
had
some
water
and
a
cigarette
and
when
i
relaxed
a
little
we
all
started
to
laugh
our
ass
off
what
beauty
lies
in
this
cosmic
joke
do
you
want
another
hit
nahh
i
think
ill
pass
for
now
i
need
some
time
to
process
this
all
maybe
in
2002

why
i
tripped
so
instantly
from
so
little
dmt
we
still
dont
know
i
mean
it
was
enough
for
the
3
of
us
but
this
we
suspect
the
mao-inhibitors
2
we
ate
before
set
my
tryptamine
receptors
wide
open
and
maybe
the
pharmahuasca
from
before
already
pushed
me
to
a
higher
level
but
my
friend
never
saw
anybody
10
minutes
knockout
from
a
single
toke
you
better
try
this
at
home




i
have
had
a
small
amount
of
dmt
that
i
have
kept
around
for
quite
a
while
now
probably
a
year
now
which
i
got
from
a
very
reliable
friend
who
managed
to
procure
it
online

i
have
been
interested
in
having
this
experience
for
a
long
time
and
i
felt
like
i
had
done
enough
personal
research
to
know
at
least
somewhat
what
i
could
expect

i
felt
like
i
had
done
enough
personal
research
to
know
at
least
somewhat
what
i
could
expect

i
have

been
a
long
time
fan
and
listener
of
the
joe
rogan
experience
podcast
and
have
heard
joe
as
well
as
multiple
guests
talk
about
their
positive
mind-altering
perspective-
shifting
experiences
with
this
obscure
mystical
and
intriguing
drug
i
had
also
seen
the
rick
strassman
documentary
the
spirit
molecule
several
times
in
recent
years
and

had
been
interested
in
having
a
visionary
experience
of
my
own
i
wanted
my
first
experience
to
be
with
ayuhuasca
perhaps
in
the
native
setting
in
the
amazon
with
a
shamanbut
i
grew
impatient
and
decided
it
was
time
to
just
take
the
plunge
and
try
smoking
the
dmt
i
already
had
sitting
in
my
medicine
cabinet
for
so
long

i
would
say
that
i
have
had
enough
psychedelic
experiences
in
my
life
both
positive
and
negative
with
many
different
substances
including
multiple
trips
using
psilocybin
and

lsd
that
i
can
say
im
an
experienced
psychonaut
however
nothing
ive
ever
felt
could
have
prepared
me
for
this
because
of
the
implications
and
stories
i
had
heard
as

well
as
my
last
experience
with
lsd
i
was
afraid
of
it
for
a
long
time
hence
why
i
had
it
sitting
around
for
so
long
probably
spurred
by
my
most
recent
lsd
trip
which
to

say
the
least
was
not
a
positive
experience
but
thats
for
a
whole
other
story
the
important
thing
is
during
that
ill-fated
trip
i
went
to
a
place
where
i
never
ever

wanted
to
go
again

my
friend
had
told
me
i
needed
to
vaporize
it
with
a
torch
and
an
oil
pipe
way
back
when
i
first
got
it
from
him
and
being
that
i
have
never
used
meth
or
smoked
crack
i
had

to
go
out
and
get
one
so
on
a
tuesday
evening
after
a
long
day
at
work
i
went
to
a
local
gas
station
where
i
knew
they
would
sell
oil
pipes
and
got
myself
the
pipe
and
a

small
disposable
torch
lighter
which
was
embarrassing
to
say
the
least
haha
and
then
went
home
to
prepare


at
this
point
i
should
mention
that
i
have
a
prescription
for
adderall
which
i
take
intermittently
for
work
and
had
taken
30mg
earlier
that
day
probably
about
6
hours
before
the
experience
this
may
have
had
an
effect
on
the
experience
but
i
cant
be
sure
suffice
to
say
i
did
not
think
about
it
being
an
issue

i
had
heard
many
stories
and
almost
all
of
the
good
ones
were

people
who
said
that
they
had
a
good
friend
or
friends
around
to
help
them
through
the
experience
i
wish
so
badly
in
retrospect
that
i
had
heeded
the
advice
of
the
countless
travelers
who
had
come
before
me
the
problem
was
i
couldnt
ask
my
roommate
because
hes
not
into
this
sort
of
thing
and
every
friend
who
i
had
broached
the
subject
with

seemed
uncomfortable
with
the
idea
so
being
the
fearless
adventurous
type
that
i
am
i
read
a
few
accounts
online
for
a
bit
about
people
trying
it
by
themselves
and
after
a

little
while
i
decided
that
itd
be
ok
to
try
by
myselfbig
mistake

my
friend
also
told
me
that
the
yellow
crystalline
powder
he
had
wrapped
up
in
a
tiny
square
of
tin
foil
was
about
enough
for
4
doses
so
i
went
by
that
estimation
and
sectioned
out

about
1/4
of
the
amount
i
had
and
scooped
it
into
the
pipe
using
a
small
nail
file
i
made
my
bed
and
propped
up
some
pillows
then
i
put
on
a
youtube
video
of
some
binaural

beats
accompanied
by
ambient
music
and
visualization
graphics
which
i
thought
would
be
cool
and
trippy
to
go
along
with
the
dmt
these
binaural
beats
use
differing
frequencies
played
under
soft
music
and
are
meant
to
induce
deep
relaxation
and
meditation
by
forcing
your
brain
into
oscillating
theta-waves
i
was
feeling
calm
and
relaxed
albeit
i
could
have
possibly
still
been
a

little
stressed
from
the
long
day
at
work
i
turned
down
the
lights
and
set
a
small
candle
un-lit
that
had
a
glass
container
where
i
was
planning
on
putting
the
pipe
as
soon
as
i
exhaled
as
i
had
heard
the
effects
were
so
fast
that
often
you
forget
the
thing
youre
holding
is
a
hot
piece
of
glass

session

1005
pm
april
28th
2015

i
sat
with
my
back
propped
up
on
the
pillows
i
had
arranged
along
the
headboard
and
put
the
glass
candle
in
front
of
me
then
sparked
the
torchi
had
never
smoked
out
of
an
oil
pipe
before
so
it
was
a
bit
confusing
at
first

i
fumbled
with
the
torch
a
bit
but
managed
to
get
a
few
small
rips
and
held
them
in
for
just
a
second
eachand

immediately
tasted
the
awful
metallic
plastic-like
vapor
as
i
exhaled
and
heard
what
i
can
only
describe
as
the
sound
a
transformer
makes
when
morphing
states
and
changing

it
was
loud
and
shrill
and
seemed
to
be
coming
from
inside
my
skullnot
like
in
my
mind
but
literally
resonating
from
the
base

of
my
neck
and
reverberating
inside
the
walls
of
my
skull
my
vision
changed
got
darker
and
seemed
to
condense
and
contort
in
a
perfectly
symmetrical
way
like
space
bending
in
the
center
and
i
remember
putting
down
the

pipe
and
trying
to
focus
on
the
trippy
visualizations
on
the
screen


at
this
point
i
could
still
tell
i
was
in
my
room
and
was
aware
of
everything
around
me
my
whole
room

being
warped
and
then
the
vibrations
started
low
at
first
then
loudervibrating
resonating
oscillation
as
if
space-time
were
sound
waves
coming
out
of
a
subwoofer
but

the
speaker
was
meit
was
coming
out
my
very
center
not
my
body
but
my
consciousness
at
this
point

i
was
still
awake
and
aware
of
my
surroundings
so
i
decided
before
it
was
all
gone
and
wastedi
should
try
to
take
another
fuller
hit

i
had
heard
from
many
testimonials
the
true
experience
feels
like
you
break
through
and
you

gojustelsewhere
still
in
a
warped
daze
i
hurriedly
unfolded
the
foil
and
dosed
out
about
a
third
of
what
was
left
in
the
foil
wrapped
it
back
up
and
set
it
asidethen

i
sparked
the
torch
and
ripped
it
againhard
as
fuck
this
time
and
then
held
in
the
vapor
as
long
as
i
could



before
i
could
even
exhale
i
felt
and
heard
a
deafening
loud
pop
and
sizzle
like
one
of
those
old
photographic
flash
bulbsfollowed
immediately
by

a
mechanical
whoosh
sound

in
an
instant
my
vision
warped
into
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
tunnel
of

fractal
light
and
sound
as
my
entire
consciousness
and
physical
form
imploded
and
was
sucked
into
a
black
hole
the
size
of
a
pin
i
could
feel
my
form
exploding
and
being

ripped
away
atom
by
atom
as
i
was
rocketed
backwards
across
the
universe
across
infinite
space
as
brightly
lit
as
the
sunit
was
like
that
feeling
you
get
at
the
top
of
a
sky-high
roller
coaster
as
you
teeter
off
the
edge
and
plunge
into
the
abyssonly
it
was
backwards
faster
than
light
curving
and
undulating
into
infinite
escher-like

loops
of
this
one
singular
infinite
moment
i
immediately
felt
pure
terror
and
realized
i
had
taken
too
much
and
there
was
no
stopping
it
now
i
was
rocketing
toward
the
empty
dark
void
i
somehow
knew
was
fast-approaching

behind
me
i
think
at
this
point
i
must
have
started
screaming
but
my
voice
was
absorbed
into
the
whirring
mechanical
banging
of
the

deafening
sound
all
around
me
coursing
through
me
it
sounded
like
in
the
movie
the
matrix
when
neo
gets
his
whole
body
consumed
by
the
metallic
liquid
and
his
scream

turns
into
warbled
nothingness
i
could
see
things
images
in
the
blur
as
i
continued
to
fall
and
fall
deeper
i
remember
yelling
what
the
fuuuuuck
but
my
voice
was
still
cut
down
by
the

broken
warbled
sound
as
it
stuttered
off
disappearing
into
the
void


the
images
and

forms
were
distortedescaping
description
but
still
infinitely
amazing
but
because
i

was
facing
backwards
i
could
only
see
what
had
already
passed
there
were
snippets
from
my
life
visions
of
things
i
had
done
people
ive
hurt
and
regretful
decisions
ive

made
but
it
was
all
simultaneouslike
a
feeling
of
pure
dark
energy
like
concentrated
darkness
it
was
a
morphing
cloud-like
entity
that
seemed
to
be
aware
of
me
and
part
of
me
at
the
same
time

i
can
only
describe
it
as
being
made
up
of
all
the
worst
parts
of
myself
the
worst
experiences
ive
ever
feltthe
darkest
emotions
however
this
thing
was

aware
and
it
spoke
to
menot
in
english
but
i
could
understand
its
meaning
it
showed
me
over
and
over
again
all
the
mistakes
ive
ever
made
and
i
was
convinced
of
its
intent
it
wanted
to
keep
me
therelocked
in
this
infinite
dark
loop
of
time
forever
being
ripped
apart
and
re-assembled
and
falling
falling
endlessly
all
the

while
being
shown
my
own
sins
on
an
never-ending
feedback
loop
of
static
torment
this
darkened
morphing
infinite
construct
was
a
prison
of
my
own
making
i
could
hear
or

maybe
more
like
feel
a
thousand
different
distinct
voices
all
around
me
screaming
not
saying
but
screaming
my
name
over
and
over
again
all
around
methrough
me
and
i

knew
that
i
had
put
myself
into
this
place
for
the
rest
of
time
this
was
my
punishment
for
coming
to
this
place
unprepared
for
trying
to
understand
what
i
had
no
hope
of

comprehending
until
the
universe
had
decided
it
was
my
time
to
die

then
the
voices
all
around
me
shifted
from
a
thousand
into
a
hundred
then
twentythen
just
one
voice
yelling
my
name
the
shrill
mechanical
banging
turned
into
a
knock
at

the
doori
stumbled
up
and
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
my
face
and
all
over
my
sidemy
arms
i
felt
hot
blood
pouring
down
from
the
bridge
of
my
nosemy
room
was
in
shambles
i

found
the
light
switch
and
finally
opened
the
door
to
my
roommate
who
had
been
outside
the
door
shouting
my
name
banging
as
hard
as
he
could
afraid
to
come
in
i
remember
telling
him
i
was
okay
after
i
opened
the
door
and
i
just
needed
a
second
he
was
like
did
you
take
some
shit
i
nodded
as
i
reached
for
the
bathroom
light
and
steadied

myself
as
i
observed
the
damage
in
the
mirror
my
face
was
fuckedi
had
hit
it
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
or
the
deskprobably
scraped
it
along
the
carpet
quite
a
bit
because

there
is
a
wicked
purple
and
red
rug-burn
across
my
face
the
bridge
of
my
nose
looked
like
it
had
been
smashed
against
the
edge
of
something
sharp
my
body
was
sore
all
over

countless
scrapes
across
my
arms
and
shins
and
a
huge
bruise
on
my
hip
my
head
which
i
must
have
banged
several
times
felt
like
a
mass
of
throbbing
lumps
and
still
vibrated

with
the
mechanical
oscillationi
felt
as
if
my
body
was
a
hologram
and
the
image
was
still
staticnot
yet
fully
manifested


as
i
staggered
out
into
the
kitchen
he
followed
me
wide-eyed
and
frantic
asking
me
what
was
going
on
shouting
i
ran
to
the
kitchen
sink
and
started
splashing
cold
water
on
my
face
and
i
realized
my
roommate
was
holding
a
small
kitchen
knife
frightened
i
asked
him
in
an
obviously
scared
and
confused
voice
why
he
had
a
weapon
and
could
he
please
put
it
down
he
said
that
he
heard
me
screaming
what
the

fuuuuuck
whaaaat
theee
fuuuuucccckkkk
over
and
over
over
loud
banging
and
crashing
noises
coming
from
my
room
he
threw
the
knife
into
a
drawer
and
offered
me
some
water

before
i
started
to
try
to
explain
after
a
few
mins
of
frantic
explanation
of
what
had
just
happened
he
finally
told
me
why
he
had
been
holding
the
knifehe
said
he
was
scared
because
my
screaming
was
replaced
by
a
deep
demonic
voice
he
swore
did
not
belong
to
mehis
exact
words
were
it
sounded
like
the
devil

i
feel
as
if
i
know
now
what
lies
on
the
other
sidealthough
the
experience
still
frightens
me
i
am
happy
i
had
it
even
though
it
was
singularly
the
most
utterly
terrifying
thing
ive
ever
felt
i
feel
now
as
though
ive
been
given
a
second
chance
at
this
reality

i
feel
now
as
though
ive
been

this

and
these
series
of

call
life

that
i
know
the
next
time
i
go
back

hours
after
the
experience




i
am
writing
this
because
of
the
lack
of
experiences
similar
to
this
i
am
a
semi
experienced
person
with
hallucinogenics
with
about
five
dmt
trips
prior
to
this
experience

in
the
week
leading
up
to
this
event
i
was
at
a
festival
doing
ketamine
and
mdma
nearly
every
day
as
well
as
a
reduced
food
intake
on
the
day
of
this
event
i
had
no
food
to
beat
the
rush
out
of
the
festival
i
had
capped
1g
of
dmt
in
case
cops
happened
to
pull
us
over
and
i
knowing
thinking
that
it
would
have
no
effect
on
my
body

t
-001
i
see
the
police
down
the
road
with
lights
flashing
for
a
road
block
and
decide
as
we
get
close
i
will
consume
the
caps
i
had
made

t
-000
i
ingest
said
capsules
as
we
are
coming
up
on
the
road
block
they
wave
us
through

t
004
i
try
to
puke
up
the
capsules
after
drinking
1l
of
water
the
caps
do
not
come
up
and
we
decide
to
continue
driving

t
045
i
tell
my
friends
i
will
not
die
to
the
drugs
i
have
consumed
i
am
feeling
sick
to
the
stomach
i
think
this
is
due
to
the
lack
of
food
and
excess
water
in
my
stomach

t
130
i
have
had
my
eyes
closed
for
the
past
20
min
slight
closed
eye
visuals
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
it
for
the
trip
until
i
open
my
eyes
i
look
out
the
window
the
trees
are
silver
rather
than
green
and
the
windows
have
a
warped
texture
to
them

t

i
decide
to
climb
over
the
camping
gear
to
grab
food
the
only
thing
i
can
reach
is
corn
pops
i
decide
to
eat
about
30g
of
them
the
trip
has
mellowed
out
a
little
making
me
comfortable
enough
to
do
this

t

i
am
enjoying
my
cevs
when
i
realize
how
high
i
am
the
cevs
were
fractal
and
constantly
changing
with
vivid
blues
greens
yellows
and
reds
my
eyes
open
the
trees
outside
are
breathing
like
lungs
appreciation
for
music
is
phenomenal
looking
around
the
vehicle
it
was
morphing
and
melting
to
the
music
the
thought
of
death
comes
to
me
\x93i
am
ready
i
think
to
myself
my
love
conscience
due
to
the
lack
of
a
better
word
tells
me
i
will
not
die
and
to
enjoy
the
ride

t230
we
arrive
at
a
subway
in
a
small
town
i
have
needed
to
pee
for
a
while
peeing
makes
me
come
down
i
am
now
able
to
talk
to
people
in
line
and
order
my
own
sub

the
tripping
has
nearly
ceased
and
my
mind
has
grew
in
love
from
the
experience

it
was
a
waste
of
money
dmt
should
be
done
in
a
different
way
due
to
the
spiritual
nature
and
power
of
it
please
love
and
be
ready
for
it

the
movie
had
ended
and
the
lsd
i
had
taken
had
fully
stabilized
into
a
trip
this
was
quite
a
large
dose
there
was
a
bit
of
unsettling
of
my
mind
coming
up
to
this
i
had
made
it
my
mission
to

inject
the

exit

a

of
two
hours
really
i
dont

why
i
love
these
dissociatives
so
much
when
i
exited
the

i

urinating
in

i
was
doing

to
break
the

down

its
just
my

i
feel
my

has
truly
started
but
there
is
one
big
problem
i
have
misplaced
my

as
of
now
i
am
writing
this
i
still
dont
know
where
my
bong
went
but
because
i
was
missing
it
made
me
improvise
and
made
for
quite
an
experience

5-meo-dmt
a
capsule
containing
a
pre-weighed
dose
of
25mg
5-meo-dmt
is
spread
out
inside
a
test
tube
with
crazy
lsd
antics
i
ended
up
finally
vaporizing
some
5-meo-dmt
with
a
torch
i
was
looking
for
my
bong
i
spread
this
dose
out
a
lot
it
was
very
warm
euphoric
but
i
did
not
reach
the
level
i
was
seeking
with
it
[like
with
combined
nn-dmt
and
lsd]

t

im
starting
to
get
a
little
frustrated
because
i
couldnt
find
my
bong
and
i
hadnt
got
a
good
dose
of
trytpamines
yet
in
search
of
a
device
to
smoke
dmt
out
of
as
i
had
plenty
dmt
in
the
form
of
50/50
freebase
to
blue
lotus
leaf
i
just
needed
something
to
smoke
it
out
of
i
had
attempted
the
earlier
test
tube
method
but
that
didnt
bring
that
utter
transforming
lsdmt
i
was
looking
for

so
with
a
little
searching
i
find
one
of
my
old
home
made
pipes
a
long
wooden
one
made
from
a
thin
tree
branch
and
a

12

drill
bit
a
sort
of
leprechaun
or
gandalf
style
pipe

now
on
lsd
style
is
everything

i
was
well
fitted
classy
an
extra
long
benson
and
hedges
cigarette
on
ear
music
in
check
dr
nogatco
ego
boosted
i
filled
the
pipe
to
the
brim
with
enhanced
leaf
100mg
of
dmt
partly
because
i
did
not
know
how
well
this
pipe
would
hold
up
so
i
begin
smoking
and
realize
this
is
a
wooden
pipe
i
should
be
outside
so
i
open
my
back
door
and
walk
up
these
concrete
steps
check
out
the
earth
in
full
lsdmt
style
this
was
it
transformation

i
bounce
back
down
the
stairs
in
wonky
style
and
enter
the
room
marveling
at
the
amazing
stylish
pipe
and
the
incredibly
lucid
transforming
surroundings
around
me
nothing
is
as
unique
and
powerfully
visual
as
lsdmt

t

so
im
back
out
on
the
concrete
steps
with
the
big
long
pipe
to
get
another
dose
of
dmt
i
take
one
puff
and
obviously
the
dmt
had
melted
and
concentrated
into
that
one
hit
as
i
exhale
i
get
that
terrible
feeling
that
something
very
big
is
coming
i
had
taken
too
much
quickly
i
turn
around
to
come
downstairs
back
inside
but
i
dont
have
enough
time
and
crash
i
fall
down
the
stairs
mid-breakthrough

things
got
very
intense
i
was
being
viciously
attacked
by
the
dmt
transformations
i
was
seriously
worried
i
thought
i
had
sustained
a
serious
head
injury
broken
my
neck
and
was
experiencing
brain
death

i
was
seriously
worried
i
thought
i
had
sustained
a
serious
head
injury
broken
my
neck
and
was
experiencing
brain
death

i
had
experienced
a
breakthrough
to
the
point
of
near
death
before
but
i
had
never
experienced
this
after
falling
down
a
set
of
concrete
stairs

it
culminated
to
a
point
everything
the
entire
universe
all
being
had
condensed
down
to
one
thing
i
was
hanging
on
to
a
single
thread
of
life
if
there
was
a
binary
code
of
only
one
number
i
was
that
1
and
the
entire
universe
was
that
1
and
it
was
flickering
between
1
and
0
i
really
wanted
it
to
stay
at
1
i
wanted
us
to
live

i
am
yelling
stop
loudly
repeatedly
and
it
didnt
help
and
that
confused
me
i
was
alone
i
had
no
sitter
i
was
terrified
i
had
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
serious
incident
someone
was
going
to
find
me
in
serious
condition
or
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs


the
flickering
stayed
at
1
and
slowly
the
1
became
many
and
things
were
reconstructed
the
hyperspatial
transformational
chaos
declines
and
i
am
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
am
alive
cold
i
must
escape
the
cold
i
make
my
first
purposeful
movement
reach
for
the
door
-20*c
weather
outside
close
it
and
get
back
on
my
feet

i
seem
to
have
injured
my
foot
and
knee
but
can
walk
ok
i
didnt
break
any
bones
but
i
broke
the
big
long
leprechaun
pipe
cigarette
lost
i
scramble
to
pick
up
the
pieces
its
almost
pitiful
funny
how
i
was
riding
high
earlier
now
im
crushed

i
finally
make
it
back
put
everything
away
and
lie
down
on
the
couch
almost
laughing
happy
to
be
alive
i
get
some
sleep




about
a
week
ago
i
experienced
what
is
probably
the
craziest
most
hectic
night
ive
ever
had

it
was
my
friend
marys
18th
birthday
so
my
friend
dave
and
i
decided
to
throw
a
party
for
her
i
picked
up
mary
around
4pm
and
took
her
to
get
her
navel
pierced
after
mary
got
her
piercing
when
went
to
the
mall
to
get
food
and
then
to
daves
apartment

we
arrive
at
daves
apartment
to
find
about
eight
of
our
friends
there
hanging
out
it
was
about
8pm
when
the
party
really
began

t
+
000

we
start
the
night
off
by
smoking
some
dmt
i
had
a
half
a
gram
of
dmt
which
came
out
to
about
ten
doses
i
purchased
a
glass
ball
freebase
pipe
to
use
with
the
dmt
so
i
could
properly
vaporize
it
i
dumped
50mg
into
the
pipe
i
intended
to
take
three
hits
but
as
soon
as
i
exhaled
the
first
hit
i
decided
one
was
enough
for
my
first
time
i
handed
the
pipe
to
one
of
my
friends
and
laid
back
on
my
friends
bed
i
instantly
felt
the
most
euphoric
ive
ever
felt
my
body
felt
completely
blissful
this
was
the
best
physical
sensation
ive
ever
felt
there
was
about
seven
of
my
friends
standing
around
me
watching
me
and
laughing
the
walls
and
doors
behind
them
began
to
bend
and
breathe
colors
became
extremely
vibrant
almost
to
the
point
it
was
overwhelming
i
close
my
eyes
and
saw
a
huge
striped
wall
in
front
of
the
wall
were
two
giant
blobs
of
goo
that
were
morphing
and
spinning
around
each
other
eventually
i
opened
my
eyes
and
gradually
returned
to
reality

five
other
people
at
the
party
tried
the
dmt
as
well
but
mary
said
she
wanted
to
wait
until
later
in
the
night
mary
wanted
to
start
the
night
off
with
a
roll
i
weighed
out
03g
of
methylone
for
mary
gave
it
to
her
and
she
swallowed
it
i
then
also
ate
03g
of
methylone
after
the
others
finished
with
the
dmt
they
also
ate
some
methylone

for
the
next
two
hours
we
listened
to
music
played
beer
pong
and
hung
out
together

i
just
remembered
i
had
a
sheet
of
blotters
with
1000
micrograms
of
25c-nbome
on
each
tab
jokingly
i
said
to
mary
so
are
you
trying
to
eat
some
nbome
or
what
surprisingly
she
was
eager
to
eat
some
and
it
was
her
birthday
so
i
wasnt
going
to
stop
her
from
doing
what
she
wanted
to
do
when
everyone
else
realized
what
she
was
taking
about
six
other
people
wanted
to
take
some
too
mary
took
two
tabs
and
everyone
else
took
one
including
me


t

im
rolling
pretty
hard
but
not
tripping
very
hard
i
take
three
shots
of
patron
mary
and
another
one
of
my
friends
each
roll
a
blunt
we
go
outside
and
smoke
the
blunts
when
i
come
back
in
im
pretty
fucked
up
but
still
not
tripping
very
hard
mary
tells
me
shes
seeing
trails
and
tripping
very
hard
she
asks
me
to
take
more
nbome
so
i
will
be
on
the
same
level
as
her
wanting
to
please
the
birthday
girl
i
agree
i
take
one
more
tab
then
i
eat
another
03
grams
of
methylone
mary
snorts
a
few
lines
of
methylone

t

now
im
tripping
hard
i
am
really
fucked
up
i
can
barely
function
normally
i
start
to
notice
mary
is
saying
some
slightly
weird
things
and
acting
a
little
strange
i
figured
she
was
just
really
fucked
up
and
didnt
think
much
of
it

t

marys
behavior
is
gradually
becoming
stranger
and
more
erratic
she
is
very
hyper
and
cant
seem
to
stay
in
one
room
for
more
than
five
minutes
everyone
was
wondering
why
she
was
acting
a
little
weird
but
her
behavior
wasnt
crazy
enough
for
anyone
to
speak
up
about
it

t

there
is
now
clearly
something
wrong
with
mary
she
is
running
around
the
apartment
room
to
room
being
very
loud
and
hyper
her
behavior
gradually
becomes
even
more
erratic
she
took
off
her
shirt
and
was
running
through
the
apartment
in
her
bra
she
is
yelling
laughing
and
making
sex
noises
all
the
movement
caused
her
navel
piercing
to
bleed
several
times
each
time
she
would
notice
it
was
bleeding
shed
start
crying
but
kept
running
around
in
hindsight
i
realize
how
terrible
of
an
idea
this
was
but
i
then
asked
mary
if
she
wanted
to
smoke
her
dmt
yet
she
agreed
and
smoked
50mg
it
only
made
her
act
crazier
i
tried
to
explain
to
dave
that
i
had
never
seen
her
like
this
before
i
was
embarrassed
because
dave
didnt
know
mary
before
the
party
i
asked
to
have
the
party
at
daves
and
he
agreed
even
though
he
didnt
know
mary

mary
is
running
up
to
guys
and
making
sex
noises
latching
on
to
them
and
humping
a
couple
who
lives
in
the
apartment
comes
out
of
their
room
after
being
woken
up
by
all
the
commotion
at
this
point
mary
loses
her
bra
too
and
is
running
around
topless
the
owners
of
the
apartment
then
told
me
we
had
to
leave
they
said
they
were
sorry
but
couldnt
have
her
making
so
much
noise
and
commotion
so
late
at
night
in
their
apartment
complex
one
of
the
guys
who
was
at
the
apartment
took
mary
and
told
me
to
come
over
to
his
place
across
the
street
he
left
with
mary
and
i
soon
followed
in
my
car
with
his
girlfriend
i
get
to
his
apartment
which
is
empty
because
hes
about
to
move
mary
is
still
freaking
out
and
demands
we
take
her
back
to
the
other
apartment

mary
asks
me
for
some
water
so
i
pour
her
a
glass
as
soon
as
i
give
it
to
her
she
throws
it
across
the
room
at
the
wall
shes
now
making
me
very
angry
i
try
very
hard
to
not
yell
at
her
angrily
i
ask
her
why
she
threw
the
water
and
she
punches
me
in
the
chest
and
runs
out
of
the
room
she
tries
to
run
outside
but
i
stop
her
she
then
runs
up
to
me
grabs
me
and
begins
making
out
with
me
as
soon
as
she
starts
she
stops
and
runs
out
of
the
room
she
runs
out
of
the
apartment
and
up
the
stairs
outside
she
tries
getting
into
an
apartment
thinking
it
was
the
one
we
were
in
earlier
but
it
actually
belonged
to
someone
we
did
not
know
i
get
her
back
inside
and
try
to
keep
her
calm

dave
gets
her
to
lay
down
on
his
bed
and
watch
tv
she
still
appears
agitated
but
has
finally
calmed
down

t

she
begins
asking
me
about
certain
things
she
did
during
the
night
she
seems
confused
as
to
why
she
did
what
she
did
gradually
she
remembers
bit
by
bit
what
occurred
that
night
she
becomes
extremely
embarrassed
and
apologetic
when
she
remembers
how
she
was
acting
neither
of
us
knew
exactly
what
caused
her
to
act
that
way
i
did
the
same
amount
of
drugs
she
did
but
i
suppose
with
a
drug
cocktail
like
we
had
it
wouldnt
be
too
hard
to
become
psychotic

this
is
by
far
the
craziest
night
ive
ever
had
and
ill
never
forget
it




my
buddy
had
taken
maybe
4
shots
of
whiskey
and
drank
3
beers
nothing
crazy
but
he
had
a
buzz
going
when
he
got
home
he
was
in
a
very
very
happy
mood
ya
he
was
buzzed
but
he
knew
quite
well
what
was
going
on
him
and
his
buddies
had
gone
for
a
nature
walk
earlier
and
smoked
some
dmt
it
was
awesome
he
tells
me
so
he
decided
to
load
his
pipe
the
same
way
he
just
used
the
pipe
to
scoop
up
a
bunch
of
dmt
and
blastoff
[hes
pretty
sure
about
100mg
got
scooped
up
because
of
how
much
he
had
left
before
this
incident
and
how
much
is
left
now]

what
happened
next
is
so
fuzzy
according
to
his
father
he
fell
backwards
off
of
his
chair
and
cracked
his
head
really
hard
i
guess
it
knocked
him
out
when
he
woke
up
he
was
tripping
fairly
good
he
felt
so
immobilized
he
thought
it
was
just
the
dmt
because
he
was
laying
where
he
normally
does
while
smoking
he
thought
he
had
a
life/death
trip
where
paramedics
arrived
and
blah
blah
blah
so
he
woke
up
saying
dad
im
sorry
over
and
over
again
he
thought
that
was
because
in
his
trip
his
dad
saw
him
die

when
he
woke
up
this
morning
he
spoke
to
his
dad
his
dad
told
him
you
know
you
said
some
really
mean
things
on
that
shit
i
guess
swim
hit
the
dmt
fell
and
hit
his
head
then
went
on
a
rampage
trying
to
fight
his
father
for
no
reason
whatsoever
i
guess
after
that
swim
had
gone
and
laid
back
down
only
to
pass
out
and
wake
up
at
the
point
where
he
was
saying
im
sorry

now
swim
knows
the
alcohol
had
a
good
bit
to
do
with
it
coupled
with
past
issues
hes
had
with
his
father
im
sure
the
hit
on
the
noggin
also
threw
swim
off
his
head
still
hurts

point
is
be
very
careful
with
when
you
choose
to
smoke
dmt
swims
dad
almost
called
911
yesterday
swim
would
have
been
in
a
world
of
shit
also
dont
be
a
dumbass
like
swim
and
smoke
dmt
while
sitting
on
a
tall
chair

i
hope
you
guys
take
this
warning
seriously
mainly
newcomers




a
bit
about
my
trippy
past
ive
smoked
the
ganja
for
about
5
years
mushrooms
about
8
times
acid
about
15
times
mescaline
twice
lsa
twice
mdma
once
ketamine
once
and
a
light
dmt
dose
once

so
i
took
a
couple
puffs
of
a
deemster
joint
about
a
year
ago
it
was
crazy
but
i
still
hadnt
gone
all
the
way
i
hadnt
broken
through
as
they
say
in
dmt-lingo
even
though
i
was
still
somewhat
connected
to
this
reality
it
took
a
good
10
minutes
after
the
experience
ended
to
make
sure
that
i
was
still
the
same
person
it
scared
me
a
lot
it
was
a
month
before
i
decided
i
would
be
willing
to
do
it
again
but
none
had
been
around

until
last
night
about
a
year
later

a
friend
got
some
generic
smoking
herb
damiana
infused
with
dmt
extracted
from
mimosa
so
a
few
of
us
went
to
his
house
to
try
it
out
me
and
3
friends
sit
down
and
roll
a
deemster
joint
we
pass
it
around
and
each
take
a
couple
of
puffs
i
notice
that
my
friends
are
taking
little
girly
puffs
they
have
no
breathing\\smoking
technique
we
all
got
to
the
first
stages
of
a
dmt
trip
significant
body
high
minor
visuals
and
that
sense
of
imminent
death
the
people
i
was
with
took
their
little
mouthfuls
of
smoke
and
exhaled
quickly
thats
not
how
i
do
things
=d
next
time
the
joint
came
around
i
breathed
deeply
a
couple
of
times
to
oxygenate
my
lungs
then
i
exhaled
as
fully
as
i
could
before
beginning
to
suck
on
the
joint
i
took
a
looong
slooow
hit
and
held
it
in
for
as
long
as
i
could

i
got
pretty
freaking
high
and
found
myself
face
to
face
with
this
faceted
greenish
wall
or
sheet
it
undulated
and
oscillated
superimposed
with
triangles
and
gears
this
sheet
in
front
of
me
seemed
thin
though
i
had
a
feeling
that
immediately
behind
the
sheet
which
visually
was
about
6
inches
away
from
me
was
a
vast
space
after
a
few
minutes
i
came
back
down
still
not
having
broken
through
i
intended
to

we
took
a
break
visited
some
friends
who
lived
near
by
and
came
back
later
that
night
to
smoke
some
more
this
time
we
loaded
a
bowl
into
a
glass
pipe
my
friends
passed
the
pipe
around
with
me
last
each
one
of
them
took
a
couple
of
tiny
puffs
and
exhaled
white
smoke
immediately
all
of
them
felt
effects
but
no
more
than
before

i
decided
to
demonstrate
the
zen
of
smoking
they
were
talking
amongst
themselves
as
i
accepted
the
pipe
i
breathed
slowly
and
deeply
a
few
times
exhaled
fully
and
torched
the
whole
bowl
as
i
veerrry
slowly
inhaled
i
kept
the
bowl
cherried
for
30
seconds
inhaling
slowly
the
entire
time
and
leaned
back
in
my
chair
holding
my
breath
i
felt
it
coming
on
fast
and
i
wasnt
even
close
to
exhaling
with
a
roaring
sound
in
my
ears
i
realized
that
i
was
about
to
see
what
this
stuff
was
all
about

i
exhaled
leaned
back
and
my
chair
broke
it
was
my
friends
house
and
at
first
he
was
pissed
and
said
something
to
me
about
it
but
i
was
on
the
way
out
of
this
world
and
barely
heard
him
with
no
chair
i
stumbled
forward
then
sat
down
on
the
cement
and
rolled
to
a
laying
position
it
wasnt
a
choice
-
this
stuff
knocked
me
to
my
feet
i
heard
one
of
my
friends
say
ohh
look
at
him
noticing
that
i
was
being
blasted
to
hyperspace
i
must
have
had
a
crazy
look
on
my
face
i
was
not
on
earth
anymore
my
mouth
was
wide
open

unfortunately
it
wasnt
exactly
pleasant

i
spent
probably
the
next
5
minutes
in
some
form
of
personal
hell
i
remembered
god
from
my
catholic
school
childhood
and
realized
that
with
the
ignorance
of
that
age
held
innocence
and
i
knew
that
i
had
drifted
far
away
from
that
innocence
i
was
being
punished
and
i
knew
i
deserved
it
i
was
in
a
personal
hell
and
felt
i
would
be
there
for
eternity
i
did
not
think
i
was
coming
back
-
how
could
i
ever
be
the
same

i
was
in
a
personal
hell
and
felt
i
would
be
there
for
eternity
i
did
not
think
i
was
coming
back
-
how
could
i
ever
be
the
same

i
was
swimming
through
geometric
chaos
intertwined
with
poignant
and
emotional
imagery
from
my
past
god
god
did
this
to
me
god
finally
had
enough
of
my
shit
and
decided
to
fuck
me
up
i
did
not
expect
this
god
i
did
not
expect
this

god
god
its
my
fault
this
carnival
of
terror
seemed
like
a
fitting
and
deserved
ending
for
my
wasted
selfish
life
i
realized
that
i
would
never
be
the
same
again
and
would
not
be
capable
of
functioning
in
society
i
would
end
up
in
a
mental
institution
living
in
this
perpetual
hell
while
my
family
occasionally
came
for
tearful
visits
holy
fuck
i
managed
to
say
dont
do
dmt
to
my
friends
and
never
have
i
been
more
serious

we
exist
we
exist
we
can
never
experience
death
death
is
no
experience
so
you
can
come
close
but
you
cant
ever
experience
nonexperience
i
came
as
close
as
you
could
maybe
i
even
went
through
it
but
how
could
i
know
i
am
alive
-
i
am
not-death
i
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
death
it
was
like
i
perpetually
hadnt
existed
the
moment
before
and
was
constantly
sitting
on
that
moment
i
was
in
a
constant
state
of
just-coming-into-existence
we
exist
what
the
fuck

i
apparently
yelled
the
words
god
fuck
and
dmt
several
times

i
could
hear
my
friends
friends
they
exist
i
exist
exist
wtf
having
a
conversation
one
said
well
we
dont
use
most
of
our
brain
another
maybe
thats
what
happened
to
him
he
just
opened
it
up
and
got
flooded

they
were
talking
about
me
i
was
rolling
on
the
ground
with
my
face
in
my
elbow
but
i
was
returning
sort
of
i
got
to
my
feet
after
a
few
seconds
said
be
right
back
i
walked
inside
for
the
change
of
scenery
and
laid
face
down
on
the
floor
-p

i
called
my
sister
who
i
had
invited
to
come
by
that
night
but
she
couldnt
make
it
i
said
i
love
you
dont
do
this
stuff
she
said
i
love
you
too
okay
and
we
said
bye
and
hung
up

another
5
minutes
and
i
walked
back
outside
and
sat
with
my
friends
we
talked
a
bit
about
what
i
had
just
experienced
which
was
exceedingly
difficult
due
to
the
indescribable
nature
of
the
experience
compounded
with
the
fact
that
i
was
still
tripping
balzz
i
kept
saying
dude
it
was
just
fuck
i
dont
fucking
know
and
my
friend
would
say
you
mean
you
dont
remember
no
i
remember
its
just
i
dont
know
tell
us
something
-
a
word
we
exist
when
the
fuck
did
that
happen
well
how
was
it
flush
that
shit
down
the
toilet

i
was
still
tripping
i
still
felt
as
if
i
would
never
be
the
same
-
i
felt
like
i
had
just
been
born
into
the
moment
like
i
literally
had
never
existed
before
it
was
scary
as
fuck
and
i
thought
ill
never
be
the
same
person
again
regardless
of
whether
or
not
i
stop
tripping*

*that
part
is
true

about
20
minutes
later
i
was
pretty
much
back
to
normal
laughing
at
normal
stuff
holding
normal
conversations
conversations
i
realized
that
my
dmt
experience
was
terrifying
but
amazing
and
retrospectively
a
gratifying
experience
i
was
too
hasty
when
told
them
not
to
do
it
to
throw
it
away
obviously
they
didnt
in
fact
i
realized
that
id
be
willing
to
do
it
again
the
next
night
tonight
-p

ive
come
to
the
realization
that
there
is
life
after
death
from
many
different
angles
in
the
past
religion
drugs
philosophy
logical
rationalization
of
the
nature
of
consciousness
never
has
it
been
shoved
in
my
face
so
hard
that
reality
existence
consciousness
*i*
am
eternal
that
i
am
alive
for
eternity
as
it
was
under
the
influence
of
dmt
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
i
know
this

dmt
is
crazy
i
still
dont
know
what
the
fuck
happened

i
think
dmt
is
a
good
thing
i
took
a
massive
amount
and
im
in
a
strange
place
mentally
anyway
most
peoples
experiences
arent
as
unpleasant
as
mine
was
at
the
time
either
way
im
glad
i
did
it
and
will
probably
do
it
again
tonight
maybe
it
wont
be
so
rough
the
second
time
around
it
was
life
changing
and
i
am
a
different
person
i
wasnt
ready




ive
had
many
really
intense
experiences
of
consciousness
in
this
lifetime
both
with
and
without
drugs

probably
the
most
interesting
of
these
are
the
hundred
or
so
out
of
body
experiences
which
ive
encountered

that
is
experiences
where
one
loses
awareness
of
the
body
yet
conscious
awareness
persists

many
years
ago
after
a
number
of
such
experiences
induced
primarily
with
entheogens
such
as
dmt
and
ayahuasca
i
became
motivated
to
pursue
out
of
body
experiences
induced
from
a
sober
state

after
about
a
year
of
concentrated
research
and
practice
i
became
able
to
do
so
regularly

i
became
able
to
consciously
disconnect
awareness
from
my
body
from
a
sober
state
and
yet
continue
to
move
without
a
physical
body
to
think
to
be




out
of
body
experiences
induced
from
a
sober
state
tend
for
me
to
be
commonly
rooted
in
what
we
know
as
normal
reality

i
still
see
things
in
my
environment
like
my
room
or
my
house
still
maintain
my
sense
of
self
and
ability
to
think
yet
am
also
able
to
do
things
like
fly
teleport
and
move
through
walls

i
no
longer
have
a
body
only
a
roving
consciousness

conversely
chemically-assisted
out
of
body
experiences
have
largely
taken
place
on
other
mental
planes

such
experiences
can
vary
dramatically
from
one
to
the
next
but
generally
my
consciousness
is
propelled
somewhere
completely
different

i
maintain
my
ability
to
think
and
remember
who
i
am
but
have
no
sense
of
familiarity
with
my
environment

in
some
cases
these
environments
are
akin
to
normal
waking
reality
just
in
different
and
unusual
places
such
as
an
unknown
factory
or
a
strange
theatre

most
times
though
these
experiences
occur
in
worlds
that
are
completely
foreign
to
me

endless
fields
of
morphing
geometric
shapes
give
way
to
alien
worlds
that
sometimes
contain
highly
intelligent
consciousness
entities

the
most
intense
of
these
experiences
result
in
ego
death
no
more
sense
of
self
or
even
ability
to
remember

sometimes
ive
pursued
these
experiences
for
purely
spiritual
and/or
therapeutic
purposes
other
times
motivations
were
less
noble
more
recreational
intoxicating


all
of
these
experiences
however
share
some
common
characteristics

they
are
incredibly
vivid
often
times
feeling
much
more
real
even
than
reality

they
nearly
always
begin
the
same
way
with
a
massive
energy
surge
in
my
chest

they
nearly
always
begin
the
same
way
with
a
massive
energy
surge
in
my
chest


the
energy
expands
and
accelerates
until
it
explodes
out
of
my
head
and
devours
my
entire
body

i
attribute
this
to
the
chakras
energy
centers
in
the
body
bursting
open
and
flooding
me
with
pure
unbridled
energy

it
feels
incredibly
pleasant
it
feels
like
warmth
love
conscious
intelligent
vibrating
energy

entheogens
such
as
mescaline
psylocibin
lsd
and
to
some
degree
even
mdma
have
also
facilitated
for
me
these
same
feelings
though
ive
never
lost
awareness
of
my
body
while
interacting
with
[only]
them




this
brief
background
is
meant
only
to
provide
context
for
the
experience
described
below
one
whose
sheer
intensity
far
exceeded
anything
in
my
conscious
memory
before
or
since

what
follows
is
by
far
the
most
powerful
bizarre
ineffable
significant
experience
of
my
life

id
gone
out
drinking
after
work
for
a
coworkers
last
day

id
had
perhaps
nine
drinks
and
was
most
certainly
feeling
it

afterwards
i
came
home
and
was
hanging
out
with
two
friends

we
continued
drinking
starting
smoking
bowls
and
did
a
few
lines

we
began
passing
around
the
dmt
pipe

after
a
few
rotations
around
the
circle
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
i
loaded
a
particularly
large
bowl
of
dmt
one
of
my
largest
ever

friend
1
smoked
first
but
only
put
a
minor
dent
in
the
huge
bowl

as
i
took
my
hit
and
sat
down
the
pipe
i
remember
friend
1
saying
that
he
wished
he
could
take
hits
so
massive
indicating
that
my
hit
was
exceptionally
large
which
im
certain
it
truly
was

i
use
a
freebase
pipe
which
facilitates
incredibly
dense
hits

my
usual
routine
is
to
hold
the
flame
under
the
bowl
for
a
few
seconds
until
it
erupts
in
smoke
take
a
massive
rip
then
carefully
and
quickly
place
the
pipe
down
beside
me
before
laying
back
on
the
bed
and
closing
my
eyes

after
that
i
simply
let
go
and
open
myself
as
completely
as
possible
the
ability
to
do
so
being
the
result
of
much
experience

as
memory
serves
i
had
a
typical
yet
incredibly
powerful
dmt
trip

as
per
usual
in
these
very
powerful
experiences
letting
go
is
utterly
essential
absolutely
required

letting
go
of
everything
accepting
death
no
fear

the
alternative
is
panic
as
you
struggle
often
in
vein
to
resist

to
me
one
of
the
less
desirable
aspects
of
this
ultimate-letting-go
is
the
frequent
requirement
to
let
go
even
of
the
ability
to
remember

to
me
one
of
the
less
desirable
aspects
of
this
ultimate-letting-go
is
the
frequent
requirement
to
let
go
even
of
the
ability
to
remember


the
conscious
intensity
of
these
experiences
is
inherently
ineffable

such
was
the
case
in
this
instance

i
quickly
became
immersed
in
360
degree
morphing
geometric
fractals
which
gave
way
to
indescribably
alien
environments
which
are
something
totally
different
before
i
am
become
able
to
fully
comprehend
them

i
lost
awareness
of
my
body
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
returned
with
virtually
no
memory
of
the
bulk
of
the
experience
only
fleeting
memories
as
if
from
a
strange
dream
and
lingering
feelings
of
an
oddly
pleasant
mysteriously
familiar
energy

typical

i
dont
mean
to
downplay
the
significance
of
these
types
of
experiences
but
compared
to
what
followed
it
just
doesnt
feel
noteworthy

some
time
later
minutes
i
think
i
was
sitting
on
the
bed
listening
to
music
talking
about
something
or
other

i
had
not
taken
another
hit
not
done
anything

suddenly
out
of
nowhere
an
overwhelming
energy
all
of
the
sudden
no
choice

it
felt
like
the
g
force
of
taking
off
in
a
rocket
ship
at
the
speed
of
light

literally
blasting
off
into
orbit

it
happened
so
suddenly
out
of
nowhere
and
it
came
on
immediately
with
such
utter
intensity

not
a
moments
warning
no
question
no
time
to
react

its
as
if
someone
just
pops
into
existence
in
front
of
you
out
of
thin
air
and
unfeelingly
matter-of-factly
without
any
warning
states
well
now
this
is
happening
and
in
an
instant
you
are
swirling
down
an
impossibly
powerful
whirlpool
drowning
in
an
ocean
of
incomprehensible
immensity

crushing
pressure
raining
down
from
all
directions
sound
rapidly
gaining
loudness
lights
rapidly
becoming
brighter
and
brighter
and
brighter
paralleled
by
a
loud
ringing
which
drowns
out
anything
i
dared
to
think
i
might
know

this
same
energy
felt
so
many
times
before
during
meditation
and
drug
usage
but
multiplied
by
a
million

this
is
far
beyond
anything
ive
ever
known

im
momentarily
overcome
with
fear
my
adrenaline
surges


my
friends
recognized
it
it
was
something
totally
unexpected
totally
unforeseen

for
a
moment
i
resisted
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
communicate
with
those
around
me

i
believed
that
they
perceived
what
was
happening
to
me
and
were
as
freaked
out
as
i
was

they
somehow
recognized
the
intensity
of
it
but
didnt
know
what
to
do
neither
did
i

i
desperately
tried
to
reach
out
to
them
but
all
i
could
get
out
were
millisecond
long
syllables
\x93ast
during
fleeting
periods
of
some
semblance
of
self

i
have
a
vague
memory
of
friend
2
repeating
to
me
\x93are
you
good
man

i
tried
hard
to
say
\x93no

words
were
impossible

i
could
not
possibly
resist
this
thing

i
had
no
comprehension
of
what
this
completely
alien
insanely
intense
thing
was
that
was
currently
happening


id
done
massive
amounts
of
dmt
literally
hundreds
of
times

nothing
ever
like
this

i
fought
it
for
as
long
as
i
could
which
couldnt
have
been
more
than
a
couple
seconds

i
knew
i
had
to
let
go
of
everything
of
my
sense
self
fearlessly
just
embrace
it

i
had
to
trust
it
with
everything
whatever
it
was

this
mysterious
thing
that
was
happening
to
me
was
something
incredibly
powerful
incredibly
meaningful
something
so
profound
that
it
would
fundamentally
alter
the
way
humanity
viewed
reality

my
only
option
was
to
embrace
it

there
was
nothing
else
relax
and
completely
give
in
to
this
unknown
destroyer
of
worlds

accept
this
and
know
that
theres
no
coming
back

theres
no
way
that
could
ever
be
possible

i
remember
red
and
white
mayan
type
patterns
fractalling
and
expanding
overtaking
my
awareness


i
had
no
control

before
i
knew
it
\x93i
was
nonexistent

i
recall
opening
myself
my
chest
my
jaw
to
this
unlimited
amazing
energy

my
head
flooded
open


awareness
of
the
body
faded
as
any
sense
of
me
exploded
into
nothingness

reality
melted
away
and
all
that
was
left
was
an
extraordinary
vivacity

there
was
no
longer
distinction
between
my
mind
and
the
external
world

no
longer
any
sense
of
self
just
an
indescribably
vibrant
pulsating
overpowering
intensity
of
being


this
unfathomably
powerful
conscious
intelligent
alien
*thing*
had
completely
overwhelmed
me

the
intensity
came
in
quick
waves
several
times
per
second

for
a
short
time
i
regained
brief
moments
of
some
kind
of
awareness

who
am
i
and
what
the
fuck
is
happening

my
movements
were
jerky
coinciding
with
the
energy
pulses

eyes
wide
open
my
mind
blow


all
sense
of
who
i
was
or
what
this
world
was
or
anything
everything
gone

ive
accepted
my
death
now
theres
no
going
back
after
this

i
understand
this
on
a
very
deep
level
theres
just
no
way

what
the
fuck
is
this
thing
why
here
why
now
why
me
what
is
this
what
does
it
mean



now
no
ability
to
even
think

no
knowledge
of
who
or
what
i
am

no
questioning
hmm
what
is
this
just
gone
completely
utterly
gone
nothing
but
intense
pulsing
energy

oh
my
god

oh
my
fucking
god

this
is
beyond
death
beyond
the
death
experience

i
still
believe
that
even
now
100%

this
is
something
completely
different

the
energy
was
overwhelming
so
intense
so
real

in
this
reality
everything
which
had
happened
in
my
life
was
insignificant
a
farce
a
meaningless
dream
from
which
i
had
now
awoken

everything
id
ever
known
was
all
leading
up
to
this
specific
moment
this
one
intense
instant

theres
never
been
anything
more
real
nothing
before
that
moment
mattered
never
would
matter

no
thoughts
of
the
past

what
past

it
was
so
insignificant
all
just
preparation
for
this
moment

in
this
infinite
moment
i
really
experienced
the
love
pure
consciousness
which
overcame
quickly
any
perception
of
reality

overwhelming
love
pulsating
electric
intelligent
paralyzing
strangely
alien
love

it
seemed
to
last
a
lifetime

the
next
hour
or
so
was
a
blur
the
memory
largely
eludes
me

my
friends
have
been
too
freaked
out
to
ever
talk
much
about
what
happened
despite
my
repeated
and
persistent
attempts

they
did
say
that
i
was
in
a
trance
somewhere
else

i
was
in
a
trance
somewhere
else


i
apparently
spoke
to
them
at
times
speaking
words
they
didnt
understand

i
danced

apparently
i
had
pissed
myself
though
it
was
dry
before
i
could
realize
it

mostly
though
i
just
lay
on
my
bed
wriggling
around
arching
my
back
moving
my
head
in
circles
as
this
intensely
powerful
intensely
pleasurably
energy
coursed
through
my
body

the
words
\x93embrace
it
repeated
over
and
over

as
i
guided
the
energy
around
my
body
and
it
felt
amazingly
fulfilling
unfathomably
orgasmic

embrace
it
feel
it
love
it


sometime
less
than
an
hour
later
i
first
began
to
regain
some
sense
of
self

the
first
thing
i
remember
clearly
is
friend
2
trying
to
hand
me
a
glass
of
water

i
stared
at
him
blankly
not
understanding
what
was
happening

i
realized
that
i
had
just
said
no
but
it
wasnt
me

just
like
that
i
was
back
so
happy
to
be
back

but
things
were
not
the
same
imaginary
fake
somehow
alien

something
is
different
even
now

the
very
first
thing
i
did
was
call
for
my
dog
to
come
to
me
which
he
did

at
the
time
this
action
was
steeped
in
meaning

when
coming
back
to
life
the
first
thing
the
most
important
thing
was
love

manifesting
that
love
for
my
dog
him
manifesting
it
back

i
hugged
him
kissed
him
as
i
smiled
with
pure
bliss

it
was
all
about
love
i
felt
that
this
moment
would
be
remembered
talked
about
for
centuries
to
come

i
felt
a
sense
of
guilt
for
putting
my
friends
through
that
not
that
i
had
a
choice

i
tried
my
best
to
apologize
and
to
somehow
explain
the
experience
which
id
just
been
through

they
didnt
understand
how
could
they

i
have
been
in
their
shoes
on
the
other
side
of
this
situation
and
know
well
the
feelings
of
powerlessness
distress
responsibility

several
times
in
my
past
id
had
close
friends
lose
all
grasp
on
reality
for
extended
periods
both
with
and
without
drugs

in
most
cases
these
states
last
hours
though
i
have
seen
them
last
months
or
even
lifetimes

still
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
them
ever
encountered
anything
quite
like
this

its
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
anyone
else
could
possibly
survive
something
like
this
and
ever
come
back
ever
be
normal
again

but
then
again
i
did
or
seem
to
have

in
the
weeks
and
months
since
the
event
experiences
in
my
daily
life
have
sparked
memories
of
what
happened

i
see
or
hear
something
and
like
from
a
dream
it
triggers
a
memory
from
this
experience
which
causes
me
to
feel
and
re-experience
it
with
brilliant
lucidity

even
just
reading
this
document
really
takes
me
back

i
have
jotted
down
fragmented
memories
and
feelings
over
time
finally
compiling
them
into
this
cohesive
narrative

ive
had
many
so-called
crazy
experiences
in
this
lifetime

ive
communicated
with
alien
entities
visited
alternate
realities
so
incredibly
divergent
from
our
own
experienced
colors
and
feelings
exponentially
more
real
than
what
most
others
will
ever
know
experienced
technology
and
worlds
far
beyond
my
feeble
understanding

ive
levitated
my
consciousness
out
of
my
body
flown
through
the
ceiling
viewed
my
house
and
my
city
with
a
full
awareness
detached
from
my
body

but
this
my
god
nothing
like
this

no
other
experience
has
shown
me
how
little
we
truly
understand
about
consciousness
and
reality
such
as
this

reality
now
is
a
mere
shadow
a
discarded
and
forgotten
dream
compared
to
what
id
experienced

ive
not
touched
dmt
in
the
nine
months
since
this
experience

frankly
im
scared
as
hell

even
seemingly
innocuous
experiences
like
getting
a
vaccination
have
resulted
in
fairly
intense
mini
flashbacks
of
this
experience

i
believe
my
psyche
is
fundamentally
changed

how
do
i
integrate
this
experience
into
my
life

how
do
i
make
any
kind
of
sense
out
of
what
just
happened
how
do
i
know
that
its
really
even
over

this
question
lingers
in
my
mind




on
one
morning
with
my
friend
ill
call
him
n
we
were
driving
over
to
ss
house
to
get
some
dmt
two
years
prior
i
had
been
obsessing
over
wanting
to
do
it
reading
all
of
the
posts
on
erowid
how
to
mentally
prepare
myself
for
the
journey
all
that
stuff
i
was
excited
to
finally
do
it


there
it
was
we
picked
up
some
crystals
weighed
them
out
to
be
a
total
of
700
mg
we
left
ss
house
and
headed
to
as
at
the
time
i
kept
a
bong
that
a
and
i
shared
at
his
house
we
grabbed
the
medicali
and
headed
back
to
ns
house
we
hiked
up
to
his
third
floor
where
there
was
a
lingering
odor
of
chinese
food
specifically
steamed
dumplings
from
the
previous
night
we
had
plenty
of
bud
and
alone
time
we
loaded
up
the
first
bowl
with
a
dmt
sandiwich
using
the
weed
as
the
bread


i
offered
to
go
first
we
had
put
water
and
ice
in
the
bong
because
the
2
percs
in
it
were
broken
due
to
my
own
stupidity
we
had
turned
on
ns
black
light
and
the
neon
natty
light
sign
just
for
kicks
we
had
some
music
playing
i
think
whats
beef
by
biggie
was
playing
at
the
time
i
lit
up
the
first
hit
was
smooth
fine
i
noticed
a
dramatic
alteration
in
the
taste
that
im
used
to
recieving
from
the
bong

the
second
rip
was
much
more
harsh
upon
inhaling
i
got
something
similar
to
a
headrush
this
prompted
me
to
move
up
from
the
floor
into
the
giant
black
all
encompassing
doggy-bed-ish
thing
that
n
provided
me
i
couldnt
keep
my
eyes
closed
but
while
open
the
loud
rumbling
from
behind
me
made
the
room
around
me
shake
and
vibrate
intensely

you
should
know
that
i
have
an
abnormally
high
blood
pressure
for
someone
my
age
its
not
dangerously
high
but
it
can
be
when
mixed
with
drugs
the
rumbling
is
climbing
higher
in
pitch
and
in
position
i
hear
it
in
two
places
high
above
me
and
far
behind
me
its
creeping
closer
to
me
but
higher
in
pitch
it
reaches
a
supersonic
level
of
sound
then
i
close
my
eyes

after
closing
my
eyes
i
remember
nothing
at
all

according
to
n
i
was
taking
short
quick
breaths
and
alot
of
them
he
said
that
he
could
visibly
tell
how
fast
and
hard
my
heart
was
pumping
blood
to
fuel
my
journey
he
said
each
beat
was
a
punch
to
my
chest
cavity
possibly
160
punches
per
minute
he
said
he
was
not
aware
of
my
high
blood
pressure
and
that
dmt
can
be
dangerous
if
mixed
with
someone
with
high
blood
pressure


he
told
me
i
slowly
opened
my
eyes
and
i
was
trying
to
say
something
or
i
was
just
moving
my
mouth
oddly
with
nothing
but
carbon
dioxide
exiting
quickly


i
woke
up
in
ns
car
i
asked
him
where
we
were
going
what
time
was
it
and
where
were
my
shoes
he
answered
but
i
coulnt
comprehend
it
at
the
time

i
dont
remember
anything
until
seeing
my
dad
sitting
in
the
pleather
chairs
provided
for
visitors
in
my
room
i
had
had
a
heart
attack
at
age
17


i
do
not
blame
this
on
anyone
but
myself
i
should
not
have
mixed
my
health
condition
knowingly
with

a
drug
that
increases
blood
pressure
please
be
careful
when
taking
this
journey
its
alot
to
take
in
at
once

part
iv
|
when
bad
trips
happen
to
good
people<br/><br/>
during
the
earlier
months
of
the
year
when
i
was
desperate
to
get
my
grubby
hands
on
some
dmt
it
seemed
a
near
impossible
feat
nobody
knew
about
it
no
one
could
source
any
and
it
was
certainly
too
complicated
to
attempt
to
extract
myself

then
something
flipped
and
by
chance
my
boyfriend
and
i
managed
to
land
quite
an
abundance
of
it
this
was
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
as
my
boyfriend
and
i
are
fucking
fiends
and
we
were
soon
to
learn
a
hard
lesson
in
respect

first
things
first
we
need
to
get
one
thing
straight
i
think
that
dmt
should
not
be
regarded
as
a
drug
its
not
a
party
starter
or
a
ticket
to
a
good
time-

it
is
in
fact
a
sacred
herb
a
powerful
ancient
medicine
that
if
abused
can
have
dire
consequences

one
should
not
be
smoking
dmt
with
the
intent
to
get
high
but
rather
to
experience
a
heightened
state
of
consciousness
one
needs
a
certain
amount
of
spiritual
and
emotional
intelligence
before
embarking
on
an
entheogenic
journey
the
effects
of
this
medicine
are
profound
and
not
to
be
taken
lightly

i
know
all
this
my
boyfriend
knows
all
this
yet
somehow
despite
all
our
research
and
accumulated
knowledge
we
still
managed
to
fuck
it
up

after
our
first
magical
dmt
experiences
we
had
a
few
more
harmless
little
dabbles
neither
of
us
were
taking
enough
to
properly
break
through
just
enough
to
experience
the
visuals
and
the
sense
of
euphoric
oneness
after
about
three
mini-trips
i
began
to
feel
frustrated

after
about
three
mini-trips
i
began
to
feel
frustrated

at
the
fractal
geometry
i
kept
seeing
i
didnt
understand
it
all
the
shapes
and
patterns
were
doing
my
head
in
what
does
it
even
mean
i
recall
shouting
into
the
ether
at
one
point
only
to
be
met
with
raucous
laughter
from
the
guardians
of
the
tryptamine
palace

the
dancing
devils
and
carnival
kids
from
my
first
ever
trip
nearly
always
made
an
appearance
splitting
and
multiplying
themselves
under
my
kaleidoscope
eyes
i
was
stuck
in
an
endless
loop
doomed
to
forever
lurk
in
the
pre-breakthrough
dimension
and
it
was
frustrating
as
fuck

sure
its
pretty
but
its
like
the
sun-
stare
too
much
and
it
hurts
your
eyes
so
on
this
particular
night
after
two
nonsensical
journeys
i
listened
to
the
boyfriend
gush
about
his
breakthrough
describing
aliens
and
other
fantastical
beings
in
a
rapturous
tone
id
never
heard
before
i
decided
to
make
my
third
hit
count

i
packed
the
cone
big
marijuana/tobacco
blend
sprinkling
a
healthy
amount
of
the
white
powder
on
top
i
was
used
to
tripping
with
my
eyelids
clamped
shut
happy
to
let
the
closed-eye
visuals
take
over
but
boyfriend
suggested
i
try
keeping
my
eyes
open
for
once
ever
the
adventurer
i
complied

we
also
decided
to
forgo
music
and
visuals
this
time
around
i
had
read
somewhere
that
the
trip
can
be
distorted
by
external
stimulus
and
that
its
better
to
journey
in
silence
we
kept
the
tv
switched
on
to
an
empty
hdmi
source
so
that
it
would
stay
on
the
blue
screen-
this
provided
much
softer
lighting
than
the
fluorescent
ceiling
bulb

around
the
same
time
as
my
vision
became
filled
with
dancing
chrysanthemums
boyfriend
decided
that
even
though
hed
already
had
three
sizable
hits
that
evening
the
last
one
was
just
so
good
that
he
really
wanted
another

so
he
took
his
fourth
hit
and
the
world
promptly
turned
upside
down

a
portal
was
about
to
open
up
on
one
of
my
bedroom
walls
i
was
sure
of
it
and
i
was
watching
the
energy
of
the
room
swirl
and
thicken
around
the
area
the
density
of
the
wall
was
changing
becoming
malleable
and
i
was
super
intrigued
as
to
who
or
what
was
gonna
come
bursting
through

i
could
feel
boyfriend
rustling
beside
me
my
eyelids
are
fluttering
and
i
can
see
different
worlds
within
each
flutter
i
am
vaguely
aware
of
bf
dashing
out
of
the
room
only
to
flop
back
down
beside
me
a
few
seconds
later
hes
trying
to
tell
me
something
all
that
comes
out
is
i
just
yeah
i
want
to
comfort
him
but
i
cannot
speak
let
alone
form
thought
or
sentences

i
am
still
transfixed
by
the
wall
and
its
impending
portal-dom
when
presumedly
due
to
lack
of
activity
the
tv
suddenly
switches
itself
off
plunging
the
room
into
a
thick
unexpected
darkness
and
simultaneously
an
ungodly
gutteral
sound
fills
the
room

its
the
devil
i
know
it

the
sound
continues
piercing
in
the
terrifying
blackness
its
like
some
sort
of
primal
heave
a
low-toned
rumble
an
utterance
surely
originating
from
the
bowels
of
hell
itself

i
somehow
form
the
presence
of
mind
to
reach
out
and
turn
on
the
lamp
on
my
side
table
face
me
lucifer
i
turn
to
see
what
incarnation
of
evil
lies
beside
me

he
is
in
foetal
position
my
boyfriends
body
with
the
devils
soul
inside
his
eyes
are
all
pupil
no
iris
black
as
the
night
he
is
uncontrollably
vomiting
all
over
himself
convulsing
with
each
violent
heave
choking
on
the
bile
that
spews
forth

at
this
point
im
at
the
peak
levels
of
my
trip
but
im
very
aware
that
my
situation
is
real
and
needs
to
be
dealt
with
i
know
im
not
hallucinating
this
shit
much
as
i
wish
i
was
and
im
using
all
my
wits
to
override
the
dmt
in
my
brain
i
understand
that
bf
needs
me
to
pull
through
for
him
right
now
so
i
place
my
hand
gently
on
his
leg
intending
to
say
something
reassuring
but
as
my
fingers
touch
his
skin
he
begins
to
turn
black
and
decay

i
recoil
slamming
my
eyes
shut
trying
to
blink
away
the
image
of
my
boyfriends
rotting
corpse
ignoring
his
violent
retching
its
not
real
hes
not
decaying
youre
just
fucked
up
right
now
having
to
deal
with
an
even
more
fucked
up
situation
i
took
a
deep
breath
and
when
i
opened
my
eyes
he
was
back
to
being
alive
and
skin-coloured

you
can
do
this
i
told
myself
your
lifetime
of
watching
horror
movies
has
all
been
leading
up
to
this
moment

i
pulled
myself
together
enough
to
know
that
i
needed
to
get
boyfriend
in
the
shower
stat
not
only
because
he
was
totally
ruining
the
bed
linen
with
a
sea
of
vomit
pooling
around
him
but
because
he
also
might
choke
on
it
and
die

i
made
a
few
futile
attempts
to
communicate
with
him
to
get
him
to
understand
my
intentions
and
maybe
even
assist
but
it
was
useless
so
i
ended
up
hoisting
him
by
the
waist
draping
his
6ft
vomit-soaked
body
over
mine
and
dragging
him
into
the
ensuite
the
whole
time
seeing
little
goblins
and
creatures
out
of
the
corners
of
my
eyes

after
i
shoved
him
in
he
just
sat
on
the
shower
floor
limbs
askew
and
folded
in
ways
they
probably
shouldnt
fold
and
stared
unblinkingly
at
one
fixed
point
on
the
ceiling
i
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
me
to
stay
with
him
but
he
emphatically
shook
his
head
no
accidentally
shaking
off
loose
bits
of
vomit
in
the
process
i
just
want
things
to
be
normal
he
choked
out
sadly

he
was
in
the
exact
same
position
when
i
returned
five
minutes
later
with
a
glass
of
water
for
him
do
you
want
some
water
baby
this
time
he
nodded
so
i
passed
him
the
glass
placing
it
into
his
open
outstretched
palm
he
failed
to
grip
or
close
his
hand
around
the
glass
and
so
it
fell
straight
through
releasing
the
cold
water
all
over
bfs
legs

he
didnt
notice
or
react

i
sighed
and
went
back
to
the
bedroom
trying
to
psych
myself
up
for
the
arduous
clean-up
ahead
of
me
the
room
had
the
same
dark
and
heavy
presence
to
it
in
spite
of
all
the
lights
now
being
on
and
i
could
still
see
little
goblins
in
my
peripheral
vision
rustling
in
the
curtains
scrambling
under
the
bed
i
knew
i
was
fighting
off
the
last
effects
of
the
hallucinogen
but
it
was
unlike
anything
ive
felt
on
it
before

every
other
time
as
soon
as
i
thought
about
my
ordinary
reality
and
third
dimensional
body
i
found
myself
instantly
back
in
it
boom
trip
complete
aside
from
some
residual
fractals
dancing
around
and
energy
trails
theres
no
more
hallucinations
to
speak
of

this
time
however
i
felt
a
shaky
pit
of
doom
in
my
stomach
i
wasnt
entirely
sure
if
boyfriend
had
accidentally
been
replaced
by
an
evil
spirit
and
i
was
too
scared
to
go
look
at
him
in
case
he
was
still
twisted
up
in
the
same
creepy
exorcist-like
pose
i
also
couldnt
trust
my
own
perception
of
his
demon
status
as
i
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
was
real
and
what
was
the
dmt

i
busied
myself
with
gathering
up
the
soiled
bedsheets
and
struggled
with
them
over
to
the
bedroom
door
intending
on
taking
them
downstairs
to
go
straight
in
the
wash

however
when
i
gripped
the
handle
i
froze
up
in
terror
imagining
all
the
potential
horrors
that
could
be
lurking
behind
the
door
all
i
knew
for
certain
was
that
the
bedroom
was
still
relatively
safe
anything
beyond
that
was
a
mystery
and
i
was

not
in
the
right
headspace
to
be
solving
a
mystery
right
now

baby
i
called
out
shakily
to
bf
still
afraid
to
look
at
him
directly
i
know
youre
really
sick
but
im
just
letting
you
know
that
as
soon
as
youre
feeling
better
i
need
you
coz
im
really
scared
after
several
seconds
of
agonizing
silence
he
finally
called
back
weakly
ok

about
twenty
minutes
later
it
stared
to
feel
like
real
life
again
the
ominous
presence
lifted
boyfriend
came
good
spurred
by
his
damsel
in
distress
and
the
next
time
i
looked
into
his
eyes
they
had
colours
in
them
again

i
still
dont
know
if
they
actually
went
black
or
i
just
hallucinated
them
so
both
scenarios
are
equally
feasible

when
normality
was
restored
enough
for
bf
to
speak
i
asked
if
he
had
any
recollection
of
what
had
just
happened
his
eyes
were
terrified-
he
looked
like
one
of
those
ptsd
war
veterans
all
i
remember
is
needing
to
pee
so
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
toilet
but
the
room
was
spinning
too
fast
so
i
held
on
the
door
frame
to
stop
myself
from
falling
over
then
everything
was
black
and
white
his
face
became
even
more
stricken
and
there
were
these
long
thin
men
black
and
white
striped
id
certainly
never
encountered
anything
like
that
were
they
mad
at
you
i
asked
i
didnt
see
any
entities
but
i
have
the
overwhelming
feeling
that
we
just
got
bitch
slapped
by
hyperspace
that
was
a
warning
boyfriend
was
nodding
in
agreement
definitely
the
long
men
were
not
happy
with
me
at
all
we
both
laughed
nervously
and
then
fell
into
silence
for
a
long
time
what
else
was
there
to
say
wed
just
been
owned
by
the
spirit
realm
i
was
thoroughly
humbled

its
been
a
few
months
now
since
the
incident
ive
come
to
refer
to
in
my
head
as
the
night
of
the
vomit
demon

im
happy
to
say
theres
been
no
residual
spooky
activity
and
our
bedroom
remains
portal-free

im
happy
to
say
theres
been
no
residual
spooky
activity
and
our
bedroom
remains
portal-free

neither
boyfriend
nor
i
have
touched
dmt
since
even
though
we
both
still
have
some
weve
stashed
it
away
for
when
were
good
and
ready
the
biggest
lesson
ive
learned
out
of
this
is
that
its
essential
to
take
adequate
time
between
each
trip
to
try
and
integrate
the
experience
you
cant
just
rush
into
the
next
one
until
youve
learned
what
you
need
to
learn

sure
experiencing
a
non-ordinary
state
of
consciousness
is
completely
intoxicating
and
while
its
tempting
to
want
to
keep
going
back
for
more
its
simply
too
much
for
our
human
brains
to
handle
i
believe
medicines
like
dmt
give
us
a
glimpse
behind
the
veil
just
enough
to
remind
us
of
our
true
nature
and
activate
our
higher
selves
we
then
need
to
try
and
interpret
this
knowledge
and
apply
it
to
our
third
dimensional
reality
and
only
when
we
have
fully
integrated
these
lessons
should
we
attempt
to
gain
further
insights

attempting
to
push
the
limits
with
this
medicine
wont
end
in
a
fun
outcome
its
like
teaching
addition
and
subtraction
to
a
kindergartner
and
then
enrolling
them
in
an
algebra
tournament
expecting
them
to
win
theres
no
get
rich
quick
scheme
for
knowledge
and
understanding
it
only
comes
with
time
and
i
for
one
wont
be
fucking
with
that
system
again
i
suppose
the
silver
lining
of
this
experience
was
gaining
the
ability
to
silence
my
inner
fiend

its
believed
that
in
ancient
times
the
sacred
plants
would
call
to
the
shamans
showing
them
how
to
harness
their
mystical
powers
and
providing
them
with
ultimate
wisdom
assuming
this
to
be
true
i
can
trust
that
when
im
truly
ready
to
revisit
the
divine
realm
dmt
will
make
it
known
to
me
so
ill
just
patiently
await
its
call




i
discovered
the
presence
of
the
drug
dmt
in
the
bark
of
acacia
maidenii
i
extracted
roughly
a
gram
of
sparkly
browny
red
powder
from
half
a
kilogram
of
stripped
bark


originally
i
had
planned
to
smoke
the
dmt
when
i
was
not
under
the
influence
of
any
other
drug
once
i
was
drunk
though
the
idea
of
some
dmt
was
very
appealing
to
me
so
i
went
about
preparing
a
vapourising
device
i
sucked
in
about
750mg
of
the
vapourised
powder
taking
into
consideration
the
small
percentage
of
dmt
in
the
extracted
material
the
effects
i
felt
from
this
were
obvious
but
not
as
much
as
i
had
expected
i
continued
to
smoke
until
i
relised
that
i
had
dropped
the
glass
vapourising
device
and
was
now
lying
on
the
kitchen
floor
the
sedating
effects
of
the
alcohol
were
lost
by
a
frenzie
of
energy
and
mildish
hallucinations
i
was
completely
out
of
control
and
out
of
my
mind
i
think
either
the
alcohol
or
perhaps
a
higher
tolerance
to
dmt
stopped
me
from
completly
going
over
the
edge
whilst
the
hallucinations
and
hyperactive
behaviour
continued
i
inhaled
one
bulb
of
nitrous
oxide


the
next
memory
of
what
happened
was
being
tied
up
with
computer
cable
by
three
friends
who
were
unaware
of
my
extreame
condition
i
was
physically
overwhelmed
by
people
unable
to
move
this
proved
to
be
the
most
frieghtning
experience
of
my
life
and
sent
me
into
uncontrolable
fits
of
tears
and
periods
when
i
could
not
breathe
from
this
point
on
only
strange
snippets
of
the
next
four
hours
are
availible
to
my
memory

the
alcohol
seemed
to
slow
down
my
brain
enough
to
delay
the
effects
of
the
dmt
or
to
take
the
edge
off
the
experience
the
nitrous
contributed
to
the
extreme
tactile
hallucinations
and

to
the
frenzy
of
behaviour
i
could
not
feel
any
physical
pain
but
extreme
anxiety
and
terror
i
was
in
fear
of
being
murdered
tortured
etc
this
was
obviously
a
major
exaggeration

by
my
contition
but
never
the
less
it
still
completely
freaked
me
out
and
undoubtably
caused
the
erratic
behaviour
that
followed
in
the
next
3-4
hours




so
ill
start
off
this
trip
report
by
saying
that
this
was
my
first
experience
with
that
beautiful
elusive
chemical
known
as
dmt
a
little
background
first
im
an
18
year
old
male
and
have
plenty
of
experience
with
psychedelic
drugs
countless
experiences
with
lsd
a
handful
of
mushroom
trips
some
research
chemicals
never
again
and
many
other
drugs
but
those
are
irrelevant
here
it
was
a
monday
and
i
had
just
gotten
out
of
class
i
had
been
partying
quite
a
bit
before
this
experience
drinking
alcohol
taking
mdma
smoking
cigarettes
etc


now
that
that
is
out
of
the
way
i
began
my
experience
with
a
decent
amount
of
ketamine
which
i
dont
recommend
sub-k-hole
dosage
but
still
not
something
you
want
to
be
on
when
the
spirit
molecule
enters
your
consciousness
regardless
this
trip
was
the
absolute
most
healing
and
beneficial
drug
experience
ive
ever
had
i
put
on
an
album
by
baths
and
\x93aminals
started
playing
i
meditated
for
a
few
minutes
and
decided
it
was
time
for
my
brain
to
be
introduced
to
the
wondrous
dimethyltryptamine
i
sat
cross-legged
on
my
dorm
room
bed
in
the
middle
so
that
when
i
fall
back
in
sheer
astonishment
my
head
should
rest
on
a
pillow
i
loaded
up
the
shalay
with
around
50
milligrams
of
the
spirit
molecule
and
\x93lovely
bloodflow
started
to
play


i
took
a
large
cleansing
breath
in
through
my
nose
and
back
out
again
i
was
ready
i
held
the
lighter
underneath
the
pipe
until
i
saw
vapor
forming
from
the
little
yellow
pool
of
heaven
two
large
hits
later
my
consciousness
forces
me
to
meditate
i
close
my
eyes
and
begin
ujjayi
breathing
kaleidoscopic
visions
of
purple
green
and
every
other
color
began
to
flood
my
field
of
view
however
the
real
beauty
of
dmt
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
visual
hallucinations
a
deep
understanding
began
to
wash
over
my
mind
a
spiritual
connection
began
to
form
right
when
and
where
it
needed
to
be
i
had
a
huge
\x93what
the
hell
am
i
doing
moment
i
quickly
realized
that
i
have
disrespected
the
pure
spiritual
perfectness
that
is
dmt
by
partying
like
i
had
been
the
body
is
sacred
and
i
had
been
putting
carcinogens
and
negative
substances
in
it
because
of
this
dmt
would
not
take
me
as
far
as
i
needed
to
go
dmt
basically
told
me
\x93get
your
shit
straight
cleanse
your
body
mind
and
soul
align
your
chakras
get
healthy
again
then
i
will
allow
you
to
go
deeper
into
the
spiritual
realm
than
you
ever
thought
possible
however
i
must
say
dmt
already
took
me
into
a
deep
level
of
meditation
farther
than
i
thought
possible
but
it
could
just
be
that
much
deeper
with
a
cleansed
conscious


from
that
point
on
ive
been
exercising
eating
very
healthy
foods
quit
smoking
cigarettes
am
completely
sober
and
doing
yoga/meditating
every
day
and
i
am
feeling
like
im
on
my
way
to
being
ready
for
another
dmt
experience
once
my
chakras
are
aligned
then
i
will
seek
out
the
sacred
spirit
molecule
once
again
with
a
purified
and
cleansed
consciousness
dmt
is
the
most
perfect
chemical
in
the
entire
world
and
if
youre
ready
let
it
show
you
what
you
need
to
know

on
a
side
note
the
government
claims
dmt
has
zero
medicinal
benefit
well
i
say
this
is
false
dmt
has
astounding
anti-addiction
properties
for
those
who
listen
to
what
it
has
to
say
i
quit
smoking
cigarettes
and
doing
adderall
in
a
heartbeat
as
soon
as
i
had
that
wonderful
experience
i
love
the
spirit
molecule
<3




i
have
recently
finally
had
what
i
consider
to
be
the
full
dmt
experience
as
i
understand
it
to
be
in
fact
although
my
experience
had
astonishingly
many
similarities
to
other
trip
reports
i
have
read
and
heard
it
seemed
to
be
far
more
elaborate
and
unbelievable
than
any
trip
report
had
ever
conveyed
to
me
understandably
of
course
the
best
description
i
have
heard
of
the
overall
internal
sensation
during
the
experience
is
that
of
terence
mckennas
when
he
remarks
that



\x93somehow
it
felt
like
i
was
finding
out
that
thing
that
you
cheerfully
assume
you
cant
find
outbut
it
felt
like
i
was
finding
out



this
is
what
it
feels
like
like
i
have
reached
the
core
of
all
worldly
understanding
and
there
seem
to
be
much
more
highly
intelligent
entities
there
who
seem
to
want
in
some
way
to
teach
me
the
secrets
of
the
world


and
this
notion
of
secrets
of
the
world
here
is
one
of
the
major
distinctions
that
i
have
been
able
to
make
between
5-meo-dmt
and
dmt
5-meo
seems
to
provide
for
a
large
portion
of
those
who
take
it
including
myself
the
so
called
white
light
experience
a
dissolution
of
ones
self
into
pure
connection
with
all
other
things
and
sometimes
a
complete
loss
of
contact
with
any
thing
the
experience
is
very
much
that
of
a
transcendental
aspect
akin
to
the
philosophies
of
the
east


however
dmt
is
what
im
considering
very
worldly
in
that
it
is
not
in
any
way
as
i
can
tell
a
transcendent
experience
in
the
previously
used
notion
of
the
word
if
i
want
to
talk
about
transcending
dimensions
or
something
on
that
level
then
the
word
might
apply
but
in
the
spiritual
or
pantheistic
sense
i
do
not
think
the
word
applies
to
dmt
dmt
seems
to
me
to
be
much
more
about
the
world
of
visual
and
sense
perception
and
the
lessons
that
seem
to
want
to
come
across
in
the
experience
tend
to
be
of
a
more
practical
worldly
nature
seeming
largely
to
have
to
do
with
evolution
of
linguistic
capability


just
to
clarify
when
i
say
worldly
referring
to
dmt
i
very
much
do
not
mean
grounding
earthly
or
anchoring
these
words
seem
more
like
antonyms
of
dmt
rather
than
synonyms
it
is
actually
far
from
any
of
those
in
my
experience
it
is
very
alien
it
is
very
other-worldly
and
very
uprooting
all
i
mean
by
worldly
as
the
best
word
i
could
come
up
with
is
that
it
seems
specifically
not
to
relate
on
any
immediate
level
to
the
transcendent
experience
akin
to
5-meo


now
i
would
like
to
shift
to
my
actual
experiences


i
now
have
experience
with
1
toke
2
tokes
and
3
tokes
and
i
have
to
whole-heartedly
agree
with
terence
on
this
one
when
he
claims
that
its
all
in
getting
myself
to
take
the
3rd
toke
i

may
feel
completely
strange
and
exceedingly
weary
about
taking
the
2nd
or
even
3rd
hit
because
i
already

feel
really
loaded
but
if
i
can
maintain
myself
long
enough
to
get
that
3rd
one
in
it
seems
to
make
all
the
difference
so
i
will
discuss
my
experience
at
the
3
levels
and
let
them
speak
for
themselves


[ah
yes
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
at
this
point
that
i
have
never
experience
any
sort
of
visuals
or
hallucinations
from
any
dose
of
any
other
substance
not
high-dose
lsd
or
mushrooms
or
ayahuasca
all
i
have
ever
seen
being
my
closed
eyes
has
been
darkness]
until
now


1
toke
-
at
this
level
the
space
behind
my
closed
eyes
becomes
almost
immediately
multidimensional
i
can
clearly
see
a
animated
domed
geometrically
patterned
visualization
largely
made
of
colored
&
patterned
equilateral
triangles
after
a
few
minutes
this
began
to
fade
in
and
out
of
itself
nothing
much
else
occurred
in
researching
some
of
the
literature
surrounding
dmt
i
found
this
experience
to
be
much
more
like
the
notion
of
the
chrysanthemum
in
gracie
&
zarkovs
commentary
than
that
of
terence
mckennas
they
describe
it
as




circular
interlocking
patterns
in
exquisite
colors
it
has
been
described
as
looking
at
a
vaulted
ceiling
or
dome

if
you
did
not
breakthrough
to
the
levels
described
above
this
chrysanthemum
pattern
as
we
call
it
is
all
you
will
see
it
is
worth
the
trip
too





i
agree
it
is
well
worth
the
trip
to
see
this
as
it
is
astonishing
and
beautiful
but
has
no
comparison
to
the
other
levels


2
tokes
-
at
this
level
the
chrysanthemum
gives
way
to
what
i
describe
as
a
very
crowded
shopping
mall
not
really
but
i
think
it
gets
across
the
notion
of
the
atmosphere
now
one
thing
i
noted
is
that
there
has
never
been
any
thrusting
forward
or
any
notion
of
traveling
at
rapid
speeds
the
transitions
between
the
states
have
always
seemed
to
happen
very
seamlessly
i
am
just
suddenly
immersed
in
a
space
that
i
had
not
been
several
seconds
previous
the
crowded
shopping
mall
as
i
call
it
was
very
elaborate
and
brightly
colored
colors
i
had
never
imagined
or
seen
the
structure
was
very
large
and
entities
seemed
to
be
moving
rapidly
this
way
and
that
very
much
seemingly
going
about
there
own
business
not
paying
an
attention
to
me
as
if
i
was
not
anything
new
or
interesting
to
be
encountered
in
that
world
and
then
after
a
few
minutes
of
being
in
this
space
i
was
back
quite
astounded
and
quite
ecstatic
at
my
first
experience
of
visual
contact
with
non-identifiable
entities
which
in
this
experience
seemed
to
be
of
the
nature
of
floating
orbs
of
energy
with
an
orangish
hue


3
tokes
-
this
was
the
one
that
threw
me
for
a
curve
i
had
taken
my
first
toke
when
the
torch
lighter
decided
to
go
dead
i
was
trying
to
take
more
hits
but
the
dmt
space
started
to
envelope
me
and
i
laid
back
and
began
my
examination
of
the
chrysanthemum
as
it
began
fading
in
and
out
of
my
vision
my
companion
returned
to
the
room
with
a
second
lighter
after
some
deliberation
about
whether
or
not
i
would
take
the
other
tokes
i
decided
that
if
i
was
going
to
do
this
i
was
going
to
do
it
the
whole
way
so
with
that
firm
resolve
in
my
mind
i
took
the
2nd
and
then
the
3rd
toke
and
lay
back
this
time
the
geometrys
of
the
structure
taking
place
around
me
were
not
so
simple
not
so
kiddy-math
as
the
previous
spaces
i
had
encountered
the
entire
architecture
around
me
was
imbued
with
sacred
geometry
the
space
was
so
vast
that
the
architecture
just
receded
in
all
directions
farther
than
i
could
see
i
have
done
some
minor
readings
on
sacred
geometry
and
it
had
always
just
struck
me
as
something
that
was
neat
math
that
could
produce
intricate
and
beautiful
patterns
but
faced
with
these
kinds
of
structures
built
literally
out
of
all
of
these
geometries
in
ways
that
boggle
the
mind


i
had
the
notion
that
these
structures
were
not
only
the
most
impressive
thing
i
had
ever
seen
they
were
impossible
not
in
the
sense
of
impossible
objects
like
from
escher
or
other
artists
but
impossible
in
the
sense
that
nobody
could
ever
actually
make
these
with
physical
tools
manipulated
by
bodily
limbs
these
structures
had
to
have
been
thought
into
existence
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
could
not
have
supplied
the
thoughts
to
create
these
structures
so
where
did
they
come
from
certainly
it
might
be
possible
to
invoke
jungs
notion
of
the
collective
unconscious
but
still
that
is
not
how
it
seemed
it
seemed
simply
and
straightforward
like
a
place
intentionally
built
by
someones
or
something


and
what
do
i
know
there
were
beings
that
seemed
to
inhabit
this
place
that
seemed
to
come
off
as
vastly
more
intelligent
and
vastly
more
capable
and
here
is
what
startled
me
most
of
all
they
wanted
to
teach
me
what
they
knew
they
were
interested
in
providing
me
with
secret
knowledge
the
only
caveat
being
that
i
had
to
decide
right
then
at
that
moment
to
give
myself
completely
over
to
them


i
hate
deadlines
and
i
hate
being
put
on
the
spot
now
how
often
in
my
life
does
this
opportunity
occur
however
a
group
of
alien
entities
in
another
dimensional
space
who
are
highly
intelligent
offer
to
teach
me
that
there
secrets
granted
that
i
give
myself
over
to
them
completely
right
then
without
understanding
the
full
implications
of
what
that
meant
to
give
myself
over
to
them
hmmm
i
have
never
had
to
thing
so
rigorously
in
all
of
my
life
about
every
aspect
of
what
might
be
the
consequences
of
an
affirmation
of
such
an
offer
i
could
not
do
it
my
mind
could
not
think
quickly
enough
to
rap
around
the
ramifications
of
such
an
action
and
given
that
i
couldnt
think
about
it
fully
enough
i
decided
it
would
be
best
to
decline
the
offer
hesitantly
and
extremely
unfortunately
the
entities
briefly
surprised
by
my
decision
then
began
discussing
among
themselves
whether
or
not
i
should
be
allowed
this
opportunity
in
the
future
or
if
i
had
decided
and
that
was
the
end


the
deliberation
seemed
not
to
be
leaning
in
my
favor
and
i
decided
no
to
sit
there
in
silence
and
late
the
fate
of
my
future
learning
be
decided
without
my
input
i
imparted
to
please
allow
me
to
come
back
and
learn
at
a
slower
pace
i
informed
them
that
i
was
finding
it
difficult
to
make
my
brain
process
information
at
the
speed
required
to
comprehend
all
that
was
happening
around
me
and
that
i
thought
that
future
experiences
would
provide
me
with
more
ability
to
navigate
the
space
properly
they
discussed
this
briefly
and
decided
that
this
was
acceptable
given
one
more
decision
that
i
still
had
to
make
immediately
they
demanded
that
i
promise
to
be
extremely
serious
about
this
learning
process
that
i
could
not
treat
this
as
i
have
tended
to
do
my
other
studies
of
which
i
am
truly
interested
but
tend
to
be
exceedingly
lazy
when
it
comes
to
actually
putting
rigorous
thought
into
i
must
agree
that
if
they
allow
me
to
come
back
as
a
future
student
that
i
will
not
chince
out
when
it
comes
to
putting
full
effort
into
interpretation
and
implementation
this
again
was
a
very
serious
proposal
it
meant
overcoming
my
tendencies
toward
laziness
of
mind
relatively
so
i
struggled
with
this
for
some
time
and
embraced
it
as
an
opportunity
to
better
myself
in
my
habits
on
top
of
an
unrivaled
learning
opportunity
i
agreed
to
the
seriousness
of
my
future
studies
and
with
that
the
entities
were
satisfied
and
the
experience
was
over


however
the
ramifications
of
my
decisions
were
still
strong
with
may
and
i
lay
there
uncontrollably
shaking
for
several
minutes
thinking
about
what
i
had
agreed
to
no
longer
from
the
effects
of
the
chemical
but
simply
reeling
from
the
implications
of
the
experience


well
i
know
that
was
certainly
long
but
it
was
more
complete
for
having
been
so
although
of
course
not
fully
complete


i
do
not
claim
any
answers
regarding
what
happens
in
the
dmt
space
but
i
have
noticed
astonishing
similarities
between
the
natures
of
peoples
experiences
that
tend
to
lead
towards
the
hypothesis
that
this
is
less
of
a
state
of
mind
thing
and
more
of
an
objective
experience
than
any
other
drug
experience
that
i
am
aware
of
though
that
cannot
be
ultimately
confirmed

except
for
salvia
perhaps
this
is
something
else
that
i
am
extremely
interested
in
peoples
comments
on
the
similarities
between
the
salvia
&
dmt
experiences
because
they
seem
to
have
many
of
the
same
facets
involved
to
me
they
have
felt
almost
identical
except
for
the
nature
of
the
visuals
and
the
crowdedness
of
the
space




its
been
a
few
weeks
now
since
my
first
encounter
with
dmt
something
long
awaited
and
highly
anticipated
but
which
completely
transcended
any
expectations
i
had
of
it

id
read
a
lot
of
mckennas
rants
about
self-transforming
machine
elves
the
amazon
shamans
helping
spirits
and
ancestors
and
friends
had
told
me
about
gnomes
in
giant
stack
hats
running
around
in
a
fully
psychedelic
playground
no
matter
how
much
i
heard
about
the
alien
intelligence
encounters
i
kept
putting
them
aside
as
interpretations
that
colour
and
play
off
each
other
like
one
person
says
they
encountered
aliens
and
so
the
next
person
interprets
their
own
trip
in
a
similar
way
which
creates
a
chain
of
influence
over
every
next
tripper

however
i
did
expect
something
alien
something
that
i
could
recognise
as
alien
something
sci-fi
or
fantastical
like
a
psychedelic
star
trek

i
couldnt
have
been
further
from
the
fact
of
the
matter

i
was
at
a
friends
house
organising
some
other
drug-related
circumstances

it
came
up
that
he
had
a
bit
of
dmt
left
and
asked
me
if
i
was
interested
in
trying
some

--absolutely
not--

so
we
got
in
the
car
and
drove
to
a
place
he
recommended
tripping
at
up
in
the
hills
in
a
national
park
a
five
minute
walk
through
scrub
into
a
secluded
forest
area
during
the
walk
we
talked
about
the
feeling
of
the
place
noting
that
there
was
a
distinct
pagan-ritual-site
feel
about
the
area
a
kind
of
overarching
all-seeing
watchful
presence
about
the
environment

but
it
was
peaceful
clear-skied
and
fairly
shady
and
cool

in
retrospect
im
sure
this
comfortable
place
influenced
the
quality
of
the
dmt
flash

i
had
two
attempts
about
15
mins
apart
because
the
first
was
noticeably
not
a
peak
experience

but
it
was
a
good
introduction
to
the
totally
alien
nature
of
the
dmt
visions

taking
in
the
first
toke
around
25mg
i
began
to
notice
weird
body
sensations
my
trunk
became
slightly
elongated
and
everything
was
surging
with
an
energy
that
was
totally
silent
to
the
ears
but
like
a
raging
river
in
my
mind

my
heart
felt
like
it
was
about
to
burst
through
my
rib
cage
as
i
reached
the
peak
of
the
inhalation

i
let
out
a
single
laugh
as
i
began
to
exhale
partly
because
the
sensations
were
awesome
not
unlike
the
body
rushes
of
mushrooms
but
i
was
mostly
just
ecstatic
that
dmt
molecules
were
finally
having
their
way
with
my
mind

i
closed
my
eyes
and
was
immediately
face
to
face
with
a
supreme
being
of
sorts

it
had
no
face
and
its
form
was
like
a
string
of
multicoloured
lights
constantly
morphing
like
a
clown
making
a
series
of
balloon
animals
beginning
with
a
dog
he
alters
a
couple
of
parts
holds
it
differently
to
reveal
a
dolphin
and
so
on

it
was
certainly
a
living
presence
and
without
a
face
it
was
still
somehow
staring
eye
to
eye
with
me
as
though
it
knew
everything
about
my
entire
life

there
was
no
sense
of
emotional
attachment
but
there
was
definite
supra-linguistic
communication
happening

this
being
and
i
were
travelling
at
great
speed
through
an
infinite
stretch
of
deep
space

i
was
chasing
it

it
stayed
the
same
distance
away
from
me
the
whole
time
and
seemed
to
be
at
ease
with
the
speed
while
i
was
struggling
to
keep
up

it
was
as
though
it
wanted
me
there
but
not
yet
not
in
this
way

it
was
telling
me
to
come
back
when
i
could
keep
up
with
it
when
i
could
catch
up
and
pass
straight
through
it

maybe
this
was
the
membrane
that
separates
the
beings
world
with
mine
the
chrysanthemum
that
mckenna
described



the
being
zoomed
away
and
the
effects
started
to
fade
leaving
me
in
a
blissful
kind
of
luminescent
state
that
surpassed
any
notion
of
zen
states
or
meditative
bliss

the
real
world
had
become
indescribably
fresh
and
crystal
clear
while
i
had
my
eyes
closed

fifteen
minutes
later
and
the
second
attempt
was
around
twice
the
dose
of
the
first
and
began
just
the
same
the
visual
environment
became
kind
of
fuzzy
and
my
body
seemed
to
spaghettify
just
slightly

but
within
seconds
of
this
there
was
a
distinct
difference

i
had
only
heard
this
described
in
other
peoples
accounts
once
i
think
and
i
had
totally
forgotten
about
the
possibility
of
it
happening
until
it
actually
happened
to
me

just
after
i
released
the
toke
i
looked
around
to
see
what
was
happening
to
my
senses
as
i
was
coming
up----when
the
entire
universe
began
to
buzz

it
was
like
a
deep
bass
feedback
loop
that
you
sometimes
hear
in
electronic
music
like
the
humming
noise
of
flying
saucers
in
movies
very
electronic
and
computer-like
but
unbelievably
real
and
right
there

all
around
me

i
immediately
thought
that
the
dmt
had
unlocked
a
whole
new
realm
of
sound
that
we
dont
normally
hear

a
background
kind
of
sound
that
would
distract
our
ears
from
normal
functioning
-
the
sound
that
matter
makes

ive
perceived
the
vibrations
of
matter
and
subatomic
particles
on
other
trips
mushrooms
acid
and
once
or
twice
even
on
the
old
hooch
but
now
with
dmt
it
was
a
totally
audible
reality

and
more
than
just
audible
this
sharp
bassy
hum
that
was
coming
out
of
everything
made
everything
vibrate
including
myself
and
my
sitter
next
to
me

it
was
so
intense
and
pervasive
that
i
had
to
close
my
eyes
to
escape
the
motion
sickness
of
this
vibrating
mass
of
existence



when
i
did
the
buzz
began
to
mutate
and
break
up
into
all
these
telephonic/electronic
modem-like
noises
like
a
kaleidoscope
of
sound

the
sounds
built
and
built
reaching
a
peak
that
culminated
in
a
vortex
which
sucked
everything
in
existence
the
buzzing
the
environment
around
me
and
my
entire
being
into
a
totally
foreign
dimension
and
there
i
was
with
total
silence

the
buzzing
was
gone
and
i
was
in
a
room
looking
at
a
wall

the
wall
was
like
a
complex
scaffold
of
constantly
morphing
angular
prisms
shimmering
with
colours
that
are
completely
beyond
the
descriptions
of
any
language
and
totally
awe-inspiring

i
felt
an
uncontrollable
smile
grow
across
my
face

reality-check

but
i
kept
watching

i
immediately
noticed
that
there
was
something
more
than
just
the
wall

i
noticed
at
first
there
was
something
in
the
wall
popping
out
occasionally
to
show
me
it
was
there
it
wanted
me
to
recognise
it
before
it
would
fully
come
out
though
it
was
something
like
watching
the
flat
surface
of
a
calm
beach
and
seeing
a
dolphin
periodically
break
the
surface
for
air

when
i
recognised
that
there
was
definitely
something
living
swimming
through
this
scaffold
of
unbelievable
shapes
and
colours
it
came
out

it
was
a
non-human
female
being
flying
around
this
hyper
dimensional
room

she
wore
a
flowing
cape
or
gown
that
streamed
directly
off
a
big
round
glowing
face
the
kind
of
face
that
a
3-year-old
kid
draws

a
circle
with
dots
for
eyes
and
a
curved
line
for
a
mouth



thats
all
there
was
of
her

but
her
face
was
so
alive
compassionate
and
enlightened

she
was
so
happy
when
i
realised
she
was
there

then
i
watched
as
a
pedestal
literally
grew
out
of
the
floor
of
this
room
made
of
the
same
unearthly
super-brilliant
scaffolding

my
attention
must
have
been
distracted
by
this
thing
growing
out
of
the
ground
because
the
female
being
got
in
my
face
and
communicated
to
me
not
in
words
\x93look
at
whats
on
the
pedestal

i
looked
up
and
saw
a
diamond
shaped
object
that
was
made
of
similar
stuff
to
the
walls

but
infinitely
more
brilliant
more
dazzling
more
unspeakably
awesome

and
as
my
smile
grew
and
total
awe
and
amazement
filled
me
this
female
being
began
flying
around
the
object
at
great
speed
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
me

she
was
doing
flips
and
sharp
turns
and
cheering
as
though
she
was
celebrating
the
fact
that
she
had
the
chance
to
show
me

she
kept
communicating
to
me
\x93look
at
it

look
at
it

isnt
this
awesome

this
continued
and
i
kept
my
eyes
on
that
unbelievable
object
as
the
scene
began
to
fade

i
became
aware
of
my
hands
folded
in
my
lap
slightly
sweaty
my
body
was
on
an
up
and
full
of
energy
as
my
mind
began
to
return
to
the
reality
of
sitting
in
a
forest
setting
next
to
the
person
who
had
just
initiated
me
into
yet
another
but
easily
the
most
awesome
dimension
of
conscious
reality

i
was
left
feeling
unusually
happy
for
at
least
a
week
after
that
experience

it
has
also
left
me
with
a
profound
sense
of
fulfilment
and
far
greater
purpose
and
perspective
in
my
lifes
quest
to
understand
the
nature
of
this
human
existence

from
these
experiences
i
have
to
say
dmt
is
quite
patently
the
most
accessible
of
the
deep
psychedelic
states
and
in
terms
of
the
practical
empirical
analysis
of
ones
own
shamanic
journeys
this
is
by
far
the
easiest
landscape
to
traverse
that
i
have
encountered
mushrooms
require
a
huge
amount
of
dedication
and
spiritual
preparation
weeks
and
months
for
the
most
rewarding
outcomes
massive
amounts
of
attention
and
a
great
deal
of
energy
to
keep
myself
at
least
partly
detatched
from
the
emotional
roller
coasters
that
the
mushroom
state
can
draw
me
into
particularly
because
of
the
extended
time
of
the
trips

same
goes
for
powerful
acid
trips
and
other
indole
hallucinogens

i
say
this
not
because
dmt
is
so
short
acting
but
because
on
a
proper
dose
of
dmt
ones
being
is
thrust
into
a
peak
experience

there
is
no
choice
in
the
matter

on
mushrooms
or
acid
one
must
guide
his
or
her
own
thoughts
and
emotions
through
precarious
unknown
landscapes
and
even
then
a
peak
experience
is
not
guaranteed

dmt
however
seems
to
serve
a
peak
experience
on
a
platter
with
a
salad
on
the
side

i
knew
from
the
moment
i
started
toking
to
when
i
found
myself
in
another-dimensional-room
i
knew
this
was
right

the
dmt
wanted
me
there
and
took
me
there

all
i
had
to
do
was
receive
it
graciously




ever
since
my
first
couple
times
doing
dmt
i
have
had
a
far
more
difficult
time
remembering
what
happened
and
there
was
a
fear
that
kept
me
from
taking
the
plunge
too
often
both
of
these
were
cleared
out
of
me
the
other
night
though
when
i
smoked
it
again
amongst
new
friends
it
was
once
again
lucidly
available
to
my
memory
and
i
had
the
joy
of
attempting
to
put
words
to
the
unlanguageable
enjoy

dose

50mg
synthetic
dmt
in
a
glass
pipe
on
a
small
bed
of
dill
three
large
hot
plasticy
tokes


upon
inhalation
the
trembling
darkness
before
me
crystallized
instantly
into
a
shimmering
vortex
of
lime-colored
tessera
and
began
a
meticulous
implosion
in
upon
itself
pulses
of
sinuous
electric
energy
shot
along
it
from
behind
me
and
i
could
see
them
disappear
down
its
infinite
corridor
each
one
came
faster
and
faster
and
faster
until
this
typhoon
like
tunnel
was
throbbing
with
supple
supernova
pulsations
it
was
then
that
i
began
to
accelerate
an
auditory
drone
that
seemed
to
flange
at
the
edges
of
my
being
propelling
me
along
i
couldnt
believe
the
breakneck
speed
with
which
i
was
beginning
to
move
like
a
proton
in
a
hyperspatial
supercollider
the
breathtakingly
ecstatic
sensation
of
being
literally
shot
out
of
the
confines
of
my
corporeal
body
was
overwhelming
and
already
my
mind
was
grasping
wildly
about
for
some
semblance
of
familiarity
no
previous
dmt
journey
had
ever
moved
this
fast
the
vortex
started
coiling
then
curling
and
cycling
into
its
cylindrical
self
and
i
became
aware
that
it
was
but
one
strand
in
a
warping
and
wefting
dimension
which
was
now
materializing
and
taking
on
a
thousand
outlandish
forms
all
around
me
ahead
was
an
entirely
ludicrous
tensile
concentric
mandala-like
disco-medusa
that
wore
about
it
a
technicolor
dreamcoat
of
fibrillating
antennae
surrounded
by
an
ultraviolet
aura
instantly
i
could
tell
it
was
alive
some
sort
of
a
sentinel
then
seemingly
out
of
nowhere
and
from
every
direction
at
once
came
these
freakish
tentacles
of
liquid
lapis
lazuli
they
began
moving
together
with
an
almost
orchestral
hyperprecision
and
i
was
completely
mesmerized
-
it
was
like
nothing
i
had
ever
seen
i
had
absolutely
no
idea
what
i
was
looking
at
-
there
must
literally
have
been
thousands
of
them
-
i
was
utterly
flabbergasted
i
knew
i
must
find
a
way
past
this
creature
though
as
extraordinary
as
she
was
we
were
still
cruising
along
at
the
speed
of
light
now
descending
backwards
together
through
an
amoeboid
octahedral
gallery
of
iridescent
vaults
it
was
at
this
moment
that
i
became
suddenly
aware
we
were
not
alone
the
vaults
seemed
to
zoom
explosively
outward
then
and
the
gallery
expanded
ad
infinitum
into
a
gargantuan
labrynthine
almost
interstellar
space
and
through
every
vault
poured
the
miraculous
and
zany
imps
who
make
the
tryptamine
hyperdimension
their
home
the
tentacles
of
lapis
lazuli
gathered
these
capricious
multi-colored
enigmas
in
towards
the
center
and
became
the
architectonic
scaffolding
of
their
new
multi-dimensional
reality
a
world
which
i
found
myself
dab
smack
in
the
middle
of
it
was
like
a
liquid
mind
ecology
of
staggering
and
alien
complexity
the
mind
as
it
crosses
over
into
quantum
warpdrive
and
migrates
ever
further
out
into
the
oceanic
beyond
at
this
point
the
glorious
geometries
transcended
what
is
even
vaguely
feasible
in
this
three
dimensional
mundane
constantly
concrescing
into
new
and
varigated
permutations
exfoliating
out
of
themselves
what
might
be
called
hyperspherologies
of
the
divine
and
to
look
anywhere
was
to
be
shot
clean
through
with
scintillating
amazement
crowding
and
cramming
themselves
into
my
field
of
vision
were
thousands
upon
thousands
of
beings
of
every
imaginable
sort
and
many
that
were
completely
unimaginable
they
were
everywhere
jabbering
in
indecipherable
tongues
juggling
incandescent
neon
microworlds
of
dancing
beings
and
morphing
with
a
zen-like
diaphanous
fluidity
that
remains
a
primal
miracle
no
matter
how
often
you
lay
your
all
too
human
eyes
on
it
the
primordial
intelligence
being
manifest
before
me
was
palpable
undeniable
transcendently
amazing
-
it
shook
me
to
my
core
in
a
more-than-real
gleeful
profundity
all
i
could
do
was
sit
there
in
divine
liquid
awe
my
soul
gaping
wide
open
and
stare
at
the
incalculable
proportions
of
bizarreness
and
the
down
right
weird
that
lay
before
me
it
was
like
being
entertained
by
the
76000
piece
orchestra
of
an
alien
civilization
in
whose
classical
music
each
note
is
not
merely
a
musical
tone
but
an
entire
world
each
just
as
intricate
and
nuancical
as
our
own
you
have
a
sense
of
being
swarmed
by
the
whimsical
mastermind
artforms
of
an
extremely
eccentric
boolean
contortionist
a
diabolical
merry
go
round
of
linguistic
rubix
cubes
13th
dimensional
millipedes
saying
themselves
to
themselves
as
they
make
love
and
impossible
gordian
knots
dancing
the
jitterbug
at
a
lyrical
lightspeed
a
gelatinous
ballet
of
endlessly
self-juxtaposing
pirouettes
you
realize
all
at
once
you
have
arrived
and
are
now
having
darshan
with
this
gigantically
insectoid
otherworldly
oz

they
came
at
me
again
and
again
a
more
than
possible
tsunami
of
opalescent
combobulations
like
rivers
of
music
and
miracles
and
clowns
the
flood
gates
of
my
soul
thrown
wider
than
wide
with
the
sheer
magnitude
of
this
dazzling
world-devouring
spectacle
it
was
the
primal
otherworldly
bewilderness
of
the
andalusian
gardens
that
grow
in
the
antipodes
of
the
mind
the
crystalline
vegetal
perplexity
of
its
delectable
ecologies
spilling
and
dripping
and
pouring
like
liquid
diamonds
from
my
eyes
the
presence
of
what
is
awesome
what
is
wildly
and
passionately
and
numinously
alive
filled
every
meridian
in
the
vast
continent
of
my
expanded
being
an
intensity
of
joy
and
love
and
life
coursing
like
heavenly
ambrosia
through
my
electrified
veins
it
was
as
though
i
myself
was
god
moving
through
liquid
ecologies
of
god
the
self-crystallizing
emerald
labyrinths
of
the
tryptamine
dreamtime
a
marvelous
infundibulum
of
plasmoidal
calisthenics
what
occurred
was
a
total
meltdown
of
everything
i
know
and
hold
dear
utter
surrender
into
the
honeycomb
lovewomb
of
the
universe
reborn
born
anew
in
a
thousand
unendingly
magnificent
eyes
and
maya
and
lila
handheld
spinning
in
sundream
dandelions
my
five
senses
spinning
like
a
zillion
gyroscopes
round
the
centripetal
amethyst
of
this
all
and
everything


i
was
there
and
then
i
was
back
-
zap
like
before
-
i
was
back
before
i
even
knew
i
was
back
the
dimensions
subsiding
very
quickly
within
me
as
the
last
few
molecules
of
dmt
were
cracked
wide
open
and
gone
the
room
before
me
buzzed
and
shimmered
like
the
most
unlikely
dream
the
world
oh
yes
-
i
remember
-
i
like
it
there
hello
people
you
look
so
normal
and
good
but
wait
something
just
happened
what
was
that
thing
oh
yes
oh
my
lord
yeseverything
was
still
a
shimmering
mindmirage
or
bliss
and
joy
and
awe
wow
i
think
i
said
that
wow


to
think
that
we
all
spend
hours
there
every
night
after
*we*
have
been
metabolized
away
that
is
and
that
every
day
the
collectivity
of
human
consciousness
looks
upon
that
miracle
for
over
50
billion
hours
is
more
than
any
of
us
can
even
begin
to
begin
to
understand
seven
minutes
spent
in
that
dimension
the
primal
furnace
of
our
being
is
enough
for
most
people
to
think
about
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
how
miraculously
absurd
and
awe-inspiring
is
our
situation
as
humans
then
that
we
are
somehow
built
around
this
certain
little
molecule
only
four
atoms
away
from
serotonin
the
neurotransmitter
which
mediates
and
colors
every
aspect
of
our
waking
lives
it
is
like
the
human
body
is
a
door
a
portal
and
dmt
is
the
key
that
opens
our
experience
to
the
all-possible
the
everything
dimension
which
surrounds
us
on
all
sides
though
we
see
it
not
that
the
simple
quantum
difference
of
four
atoms
can
open
this
for
anyone
to
see
is
and
will
remain
the
greatest
most
mysterious
enigma
in
this
life
the
day
we
unlock
its
secrets
we
will
for
the
first
time
awaken
from
the
dream






\x93there
are
things
you
dont
know
but
more
importantly
is
that
there
are
things
you
cant
know

<br/><br/>
to
begin
the
tale
of
this
particular
jump
into
the
depths
of
psychedelia
ill
start
by
giving
a
description
of
my
previous
experience
with
pharmacological
agents
in
the
course
of
four
years
ive
smoked
marijuana
too
many
times
to
count
ingested
lsd
about
two
dozen
times
eaten
mushrooms
a
handful
of
times
taken
mdma
seven
times
had
a
love
affair
with
ketamine
smoked
dmt
on
a
handful
of
occasions
and
dabbled
briefly
with
many
other
psychoactive
substances
including
mda
lsa
2c-e
25i-nbome
25b-nbome
methalone
opium
ghb
nitrous
and
cocaine
personally
i
find
compounds
of
at
least
a
partially
psychedelic
nature
to
be
the
most
beneficial
and
interesting
of
drug
categories
and
here
i
make
the
distinction
between
hallucinogenic
and
psychedelic
drugs



it
was
around
330
pm
on
what
had
begun
as
a
rainy
day
in
july
when
my
friends
r
and
h
suggested
we
\x93blast
off
on
some
dmt
all
three
of
us
were
in
good
spirits
as
wed
spent
the
previous
night
at
a
friends
house
babysitting
a
few
people
on
mdma
in
my
personal
experience
having
to
be
sober
around
people
who
are
rolling
is
so
joyful
that
i
might
as
well
have
taken
the
mdma
myself

in
my
personal
experience
having
to
be
sober
around
people
who
are
rolling
is
so
joyful
that
i
might
as
well
have
taken
the
mdma
myself

but
there
was
also
the
task
of
explaining
to
the
first-timers
that
while
mdma
is
extremely
euphoric
and
pleasurable
it
can
also
be
addicting
and
dangerous
and
is
something
to
be
respected
ive
always
been
slightly
offended
by
its
over-popularization
of
use
within
hip-hop
culture

we
decided
not
to
make
any
particular
preparations
for
this
trip
except
that
i
asked
them
not
to
play
any
music
during
the
experience
as
not
to
distract
me
from
whatever
i
may
see
think
or
feel
this
may
seem
reckless
but
h
told
r
and
me
that
too
much
time
passing
between
the
desire
to
trip
and
the
actual
trip
might
kill
his
nerve
to
try
it
h
had
only
smoked
dmt
one
other
time
and
so
r
and
i
were
doing
our
best
to
play
by
his
rules
and
allow
for
his
comfort
i
watched
as
r
loaded
his
bong
with
the
layered
batch
of
marijuana
and
dmt
first
for
himself
and
then
for
h
although
both
of
them
enjoyed
the
effects
and
praised
them
as
being
very
significant
both
also
admitted
to
having
not
quite
\x93broken
through
i
asked
r
to
measure
out
the
bowl
hed
be
giving
me
so
that
i
could
be
sure
to
see
the
other
side
but
he
shook
his
head
and
said
\x93for
you
ill
just
pack
it
nice
and
big


based
on
my
own
observational
estimate
id
say
he
gave
me
about
150
mg
but
this
is
speculation

he
handed
me
the
lighter
and
i
burned
the
top
layer
of
marijuana
pulling
on
the
bong
hard
and
attempting
maximum
impact


usually
when
ive
smoked
dmt
on
previous
occasions
there
has
been
a
distinct
buildup
of
effects
including
slight
burning
sensation
in
the
lungs
a
warm
surge
slowly
coursing
through
my
torso
towards
my
head
a
buzzing
in
the
ears
that
grows
to
monstrous
proportions
and
increased
sensitivity
in
my
mouth
which
i
believe
is
brought
on
by
the
rather
unpleasant
taste
of
the
substance
i
follow
this
with
lying
back
closing
my
eyes
and
traveling
through
a
wormhole-like
field
which
contains
a
continuous
swirl
and
interchange
of
intensely
complicated
and
colorful
geometric
forms
that
flow
into
an
opening
of
sorts
until
suddenly
i
am
somewhere
else
and
it
is
truly
foreign
this
time
things
were
different


rs
voice
faded
to
nothing
as
i
heard
him
tell
me
to
try
to
hold
the
smoke
in
but
i
had
succeeded
in
maximum
impact
and
there
was
simply
no
way
i
wasnt
going
to
cough
up
the
body
full
of
dmt
essence
id
imbibed
immediately
it
was
enough

i
have
no
idea
how
long
it
actually
took
the
phases
of
my
trip
to
occur
due
to
time
dilation
but
ive
tried
to
pin
them
as
well
as
i
could


t+001
there
was
no
wormhole
i
simply
closed
my
eyes
and
immediately
was
not
in
rs
room
anymore
instead
i
was
surrounded
by
a
dozen
or
more
beings
that
were
dancing
in
the
most
acrobatic
of
fashions-
skipping
and
cart
wheeling
and
moving
their
bodies
in
styles
i
find
hard
to
describe
their
bodies
were
somewhat
humanoid
in
that
they
had
heads
and
limbs
resembling
ours
but
this
was
not
a
three-dimensional
realm
they
seemed
to
be
made
out
of
a
sort
of
constantly
flowing
extra-dimensional
energy
which
pulsed
and
changed
colors
rapidly
and
im
fairly
certain
they
had
male
and
female
genders
or
at
least
two
distinct
kinds
to
their
race
they
had
mouths
that
stretched
across
their
faces
eyes
made
of
the
brightest
light
rather
large
ears
more
pointed
than
ours
and
what
looked
to
me
to
be
a
kind
of
hair
on
their
heads
the
scale
of
their
frame
was
enormous
it
was
like
being
in
a
room
of
incredibly
benevolent
giants
i
was
in
awe
who
wouldnt
have
been
i
had
made
contact
with
things
within
the
dmt
realm
before
but
none
were
so
charming
or
so
entertaining
as
these
fellows


t+002
they
danced
in
beautiful
rhythmic
patterns
and
laughed
and
beckoned
me
to
follow
them
and
so
i
did
they
showed
me
their
home
a
super-dimensional
fortress
of
such
aesthetic
wonder
that
i
can
scarcely
compare
it
with
even
the
finest
structures
and
monuments
of
human
history
we
traveled
down
what
appeared
to
be
an
endless
corridor
of
lighti
didnt
seem
to
have
a
body
but
floated
in
their
direction
just
the
same
and
all
the
while
the
beings
danced
in
and
out
of
my
view
jumping
from
behind
pillars
that
littered
the
great
hall
to
smile
in
my
face
in
all
directions
there
appeared
to
be
no
end
to
this
uncanny
structure
and
for
that
reason
i
am
still
baffled
as
to
where
the
pillars
began
and
ended
they
had
other
structures
that
looked
like
huge
shifting
platforms
suspended
in
space
and
as
i
moved
along
i
found
them
all
looking
up
or
down
or
across
from
their
platforms
to
laugh
and
smile
at
me


t+003
for
some
time
i
found
it
all
but
impossible
to
formulate
a
usual
train
of
thought
but
after
the
initial
rush
of
being
in
such
a
strange
and
ravishing
land
i
began
to
speculate
about
these
beings
my
first
thought
was
\x93be
you
friend
or
foe
their
responses
were
to
laugh
and
smile
but
they
seemed
to
be
sending
a
kind
of
telepathic
signal
that
said
\x93of
course
we
are
your
friends
to
find
out
whether
this
was
true
or
not
i
simply
began
loving
them
it
was
so
easy
never
before
had
i
been
so
able
to
focus
and
extreme
positive
emotion
on
something
so
newfound
the
feeling
just
flowed
so
naturally
from
every
corner
of
my
being
and
i
was
so
grateful
and
happy
for
having
found
these
friends
in
this
far
off
world
i
told
them
over
and
over
again
that
i
loved
them
and
they
signaled
to
me
that
they
loved
me
as
well
and
the
energy
in
their
already
impressive
bodies
was
amplified
to
an
immense
glow
of
pink
and
orange
they
told
me
that
theyd
been
waiting
for
me
that
theyd
been
waiting
for
all
of
us
this
was
a
cosmic
temple
a
safe
haven
for
the
universes
children
and
a
learning
center
for
all
who
would
accept
it

t+
004
i
got
it
i
understood
these
things
knew
the
nature
of
my
presence
they
knew
i
was
a
stranger
who
needed
a
little
help
and
they
were
being
good
hosts
they
were
the
ultimate
performers
in
a
cross-world
of
pure
love
there
to
entertain
and
teach
me
their
message
was
simply
that
i
appreciate
and
love
all
things
around
me
and
that
i
be
in
the
service
of
others
they
praised
me
for
my
understanding
and
for
a
moment
im
fairly
sure
i
saw
one
of
the
pairs
of
male
and
female
present
a
smaller
one
of
them
perhaps
their
child
im
not
sure
as
to
what
this
was
supposed
to
signify
but
my
understanding
is
that
it
was
a
furthering
of
their
trust
in
me

t+005
the
trip
began
to
descend
back
from
such
great
heights
and
something
very
different
happened
in
previous
experiences
coming
down
has
simply
been
the
fading
of
the
dmt
realm
from
my
senses
into
a
murky
haze
and
finally
into
standard
reality
this
time
it
was
more
like
being
in
a
glass
elevator
that
was
going
down
with
tenacious
speed

this
time
it
was
more
like
being
in
a
glass
elevator
that
was
going
down
with
tenacious
speed

it
was
like
i
was
catching
a
brief
glimpse
of
each
world
or
dimension
that
came
before
that
of
the
playful
performers
but
i
was
going
too
quickly
to
actually
see
the
details
of
each
layer
why
i
had
no
buildup
but
instead
a
build-down
is
still
puzzling


t+006
i
opened
my
eyes
and
started
laughing
the
dmt
still
swarmed
my
visual
field
with
light
and
intricacy
and
as
i
looked
out
rs
window
at
what
had
once
been
considered
a
dreary
day
i
was
filled
with
a
sense
of
life
and
gratitude
the
backyard
was
gloriously
ablaze
with
colored
detail
and
i
was
filled
with
a
reverence
for
nature
and
wildlife
and
asked
myself
why
man
must
make
such
selfish
endeavors
like
the
destruction
of
forests
for
perceived
profit
i
swear
in
that
moment
i
could
see
the
spirit
of
the
trees
they
had
faces
that
smiled
at
my
understanding
and
hopeful
appreciation
perhaps
within
our
dimensional
latitude
trees
appear
to
be
nothing
more
than
organic
statues
but
in
that
range
of
mind
they
were
easily
as
sentient
as
people
if
not
more
so


as
the
residual
effects
slowly
dwindled
over
the
next
10
minutes
i
stood
up
and
smiled
and
laughed
for
a
few
minutes
before
telling
r
and
h
how
much
i
loved
them
and
about
my
experience
h
would
later
tell
me
to
my
astonishment
that
i
had
only
had
my
eyes
closed
for
about
five
minutes
i
told
him
i
didnt
believe
in
time


i
went
home
ate
showered
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
alone
thinking
about
alan
watts
referring
to
life
as
a
dance
of
pattern
and
about
how
ralph
waldo
emerson
had
talked
about
the
course
of
human
history
having
existed
within
the
mind
of
mankind
before
itd
ever
played
out
in
short
this
was
my
favorite
dmt
experience
it
filled
me
with
hope
for
the
future
and
renewed
my
faith
in
the
power
of
positive
thinking
though
i
was
sick
all
day
ive
never
felt
better
the
universe
is
alive
and
its
pulse
will
rattle
you
to
the
core




an
attempt
to
remember

one
evening
at
my
friends
3rd
floor
apartment
i
breakthrough
like
never
before
and
its
about
dmtime
sitting
on
the
balcony
awith
a
cool
breeze
blowing
i
am
looking
out
at
the
city
there
are
two
huge
trees
across
from
me
one
to
my
right
and
the
other
directly
in
front
of
me
some
tall
younger
trees
are
to
the
left
along
with
another
large
tree
whose
branches
stretch
up
over
the
balcony
railing
white
christmas
lights
wrap
around
the
balcony
and
although
the
deep
purple
sky
has
charcoal
clouds
i
can
still
see
some
stars
after
the
second
rip
i
am
rushed
out
of
my
body
and
i
barely
manage
to
hit
play
on
my
ipod
as
shpongles
\x93behind
closed
eyelids
begins
pulsating
through
my
headphones
my
spirit
energy
bursts
exploding
out
of
my
physical
container
spreading
until
interwoven
and
inseparable
from
the
network
of
life
i
can
feel
my
connection
to
all
things
i
feel
the
consciousnesses
of
my
friends
in
the
room
behind
me
the
consciousnesses
of
the
world
i
can
look
through
the
mind
and
eyes
of
others
and
sense
the
consciousness
of
those
i
have
been
close
to
even
friends
i
havent
seen
in
some
time

i
am
at
once
the
smallest
atom
in
my
body
and
the
entire
universe
i
control
the
movements
of
far
away
objects
entire
solar
systems
i
feel
like
a
galaxy
my
spiral
arms
spreading
through
every
microcosm
of
existence
my
consciousness
spreads
through
creation
as
i
am
in
communion
with
the
creator
it
was
smiling
almost
menacingly
at
me
through
many
faces
i
go
through
loops
of
realizing
the
beauty
of
creation
then
feeling
worried
about
something
that
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
as
snake-like
dna
helixes
are
constantly
unwinding
spinning
and
spiraling
all
around
me
looking
at
me
death
enters
my
mind
as
i
think
about
how
my
current
form
must
end
although
i
know
that
it
never
ends
that
the
soul
is
eternal
and
the
energy
is
always
recycled
reincarnated
but
still
i
feel
unable
to
grasp
or
cope
with
something
something
is
there
that
i
just
cant
understand
or
be
at
peace
with
this
consciousness
seems
to
say
something
like
\x93youre
not
meant
to
understand
this
yet
or
maybe
it
was
\x93you
already
know
the
answer
at
the
same
time
it
reveals
countless
other
mysteries
i
am
overcome
by
how
amazing
and
dazzling
it
all
is
as
i
journey
through
space
transcending
matter
and
time

as
i
enjoy
this
spiritual
roller
coaster
i
remember
the
unity
of
all
consciousness
while
also
remembering
the
preciousness
and
uniqueness
of
each
and
every
individual
soul
*we
are
all
one*
i
have
several
flashbacks
often
seeing
close
friends
who
i
had
once
journeyed
with
during
other
life-changing
mind-expanding
adventures
and
begin
recalling
specific
scenes
vlad
and
kev
tossing
a
red
glowstick
back
and
forth
across
the
dam
at
mercer
me
having
similar
loops
of
worry
and
relief
re-realizing
that
there
really
was
nothing
to
worry
about
after
all
not
like
a
hazy
or
distant
memory
though
they
flash
vividly
in
front
of
me
and
really
appear
there
friends
really
speak
to
me
repeat
or
showing
me
things
as
reminders
i
glimpse
what
seems
like
past
lives
or
other
peoples
experiences
whenever
i
begin
feeling
worried
or
anxious
the
color
or
tint
of
my
visuals
would
change
to
a
reddish
dark
colour
scheme
in
sync
with
my
state
of
mind
as
the
negativity
shifts
or
i
begin
understanding
that
life
is
a
beautiful
gift
to
be
enjoyed
despite
whatever
struggles
it
holds
and
i
simply
need
to
love
as
much
and
as
many
people
that
i
could
the
tint
again
begins
to
change
shifting
to
another
palette
of
greens
and
yellows
i
dont
know
how
long
i
go
through
these
loops
of
deep
feeling
and
emotion
shifting
to
blues
and
oranges
then
reds
and
back
to
yellows
and
greens
again

all
the
while
this
consciousness
watches
me
sometimes
seeming
to
take
the
forms
of
large
trees
in
front
of
me
and
to
my
right
the
\x93faces
of
these
trees
look
melancholy
the
one
in
the
middle
frightening
maybe
even
angry
at
the
neglect
of
this
human
community
that
lets
their
roots
choke
in
the
concrete
and
asphalt
but
still
they
grow
strong
and
vibrant
this
all
encompassing
consciousness
continues
smiling
with
its
somewhat
freakish
grin
shaking
its
\x93heads
at
me
whenever
i
make
a
false
conclusion
or
become
worried
or
anxious
about
my
lack
of
understanding
occasionally
it
looks
at
me
with
a
sort
of
pitiful
expression
sometimes
changing
to
a
very
solemn
and
serious
piercing
look
depending
on
what
is
being
communicated
or
what
i
am
thinking/asking
upon
breaking
through
i
had
that
familiar
feeling
of
having
been
there
before

upon
breaking
through
i
had
that
familiar
feeling
of
having
been
there
before

but
at
the
same
time
i
was
struck
with
the
sensation
of
stumbling
into
a
room
surrounded
by
observers
higher
lightbeings
the
faces
of
god
they
look
down
at
me
with
benign
almost
condescending
expressions
giving
me
the
feeling
that
i
wasnt
really
supposed
to
be
there
yet
but
that
they
were
still
going
to
teach
me
as
much
as
possible
in
the
time
that
i
had

at
some
point
i
feel
as
if
i
may
be
unable
to
return
to
my
bodily
vessel
or
maybe
that
i
dont
want
to
or
just
dont
know
how
i
begin
bouncing
in
and
out
of
my
body
going
deep
inside
and
inversing
back
out
careening
through
far
reaches
of
the
universe
and
rushing
back
down
and
around
my
earthly
location
after
doing
this
for
some
time
this
consciousness
kind
of
takes
my
energy
and
smushes
me
back
down
crams
my
energy
back
into
my
physical
form
after
i
am
squeezed
back
into
my
body
like
an
overstuffed
travel
bag
i
slowly
reconnect
with
my
nerves
and
my
body
tissues
again
despite
whatever
negative
or
positive
feelings
i
might
have
and
at
any
given
instant
throughout
the
trip
there
is
always
the
magnificent
enjoyment
at
the
kaleidoscopic
dance
spinning
before
me
the
ride
that
i
am
controlling
creating
and
changing
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously
i
become
aware
of
things
that
i
need
to
change
in
myself
ways
i
need
to
be
more
conscious
of
how
i
act
towards
others
the
need
to
be
more
careful
about
the
energy
i
send
out
how
i
need
to
take
better
care
of
my
body
and
make
an
effort
to
use
each
moment
i
am
given
be
the
change
you
wish
to
see
in
the
world-mahatma
gandhi
is
a
quote
that
comes
to
mind

throughout
the
entire
experience
i
am
flooded
with
the
most
extreme
ecstasy
and
euphorically
blissful
vibrations
stronger
than
i
had
ever
imagined
at
times
it
reaches
an
almost
uncomfortable
level
of
intensity
and
it
comes
in
the
form
of
waves
of
energy
much
like
an
ocean
storm
whose
power
fluxes
and
fluctuates
growing
calm
and
then
churning
with
awesome
strength
sometimes
it
feels
as
if
this
storm
is
overtaking
me
drowning
me
despite
contradictory
feelings
of
ecstatic
euphoria
i
also
feel
i
am
going
through
a
painful
process
that
i
need
to
get
through
as
if
slowing
dying
and
being
reborn
with
the
buildup
of
trying
to
reach
an
orgasmic
climax
but
one
that
i
am
fearful
of
reaching
i
have
tremendous
difficulties
breaking
through
blockages
in
my
body
crossing
narrow
bridges
over
gaping
sheer
cliffs
and
valleys
and
have
to
be
guided
by
this
multi-visaged
father
consciousness
the
grand
orchestrator
designer
consciousness
that
exists
all
around
me
and
through
me

i
was
often
in
a
perpetual
state
of
questioning
getting
hit
with
answers
that
seemed
so
obvious
afterwards
or
being
told
that
i
knew
the
answers
or
that
they
would
come
later
i
was
also
constantly
losing
my
grasp
of
understanding
of
certain
things
immediately
after
i
had
gained
it
this
ties
into
the
mind
loops
of
worry
and
relief
that
i
was
describing
before
i
was
confronted
with
what
appeared
as
good
or
evil
forces
sometimes
transforming
into
each
other
as
i
grappled
with
those
concepts
the
visual
beauty
of
the
trip
was
unmatched
by
any
previous
psychedelic
experience
i
knew
that
this
is
it
i
had
the
understanding
that
i
had
unlocked
something
that
i
had
began
to
lose
i
knew
that
i
lived
in
the
divine
state
as
alan
watts
describes
in
\x93the
nature
of
consciousness
i
knew
that
nature
was
conscious
that
this
was
the
consciousness
of
the
universe
with
which
i
was
communicating
i
was
able
to
watch
the
very
notes
of
the
song
of
life
the
one
verse
\x93uni-verse
being
played
before
me
and
i
knew
that
this
was
an
ongoing
concerto
that
we
were
all
co-creating
every
infinite
moment

it
was
indeed
overwhelming
i
was
often
overcome
by
the
bombardment
of
information
and
experience
unlike
the
usual
eventual
comedown
i
associate
with
dmt
trips
like
beginning
to
descend
an
escalator
i
actually
felt
i
needed
to
make
an
effort
to
come
down
and
briefly
began
feeling
fearful
and
anxious
about
doing
so
it
took
deliberate
concentration
for
me
to
return
towards
the
end
i
just
wanted
to
live
again
back
in
the
present
physical
realm
so
that
i
could
process
and
share
my
experience
so
that
i
could
begin
to
not
waste
another
second
on
anything
unworthy
of
all
the
energy
that
has
gone
into
my
blessed
existence

one
thing
i
recall
about
the
entire
trip
was
that
no
matter
how
chaotic
it
got
no
matter
how
ridiculously
mindfuckingly
inexpressible
it
became
i
had
an
unflinchingly
coherent
awareness
of
myself
and
my
thoughts
i
was
fully
lucid
throughout
it
all

i
was
fully
lucid
throughout
it
all

which
is
something
i
cannot
say
about
my
past
dmt
breakthroughs
although
there
are
some
parts
about
it
that
im
nowhere
close
to
understanding
and
despite
my
worries
about
the
end
of
all
things
or
my
unpleasant
feelings
of
this
god-consciousness
laughing
in
my
face
it
was
a
priceless
and
positive
learning
experience
being
immersed
in
love
and
energy
i
was
reminded
that
we
are
each
creating
everything
we
experience
that
this
is
the
life
we
have
made
being
made
through
us
having
been
made
for
us
and
by
us
it
was
an
undeniable
divine
moment
of
truth
that
i
will
never
forget
and
never
fully
remember

amongst
my
episodes
of
ethereal
epilepsy
metaphysical
madness
and
supranatural
sensations
there
were
still
parts
of
the
trip
where
i
was
just
jammin
laughing
ecstatically
and
filled
with
exuberance
as
i
enjoyed
the
visuals
and
took
deep
full
breaths
of
the
freshest
air
id
ever
tasted
inhale
exhale




prologue
i
have
always
been
reluctant
to
write
down
and

publish
submit
an
experience
like
this
due
to
two
reasons
firstly
because
i
don´t
feel
very
comfortable
expressing
something
which
is
so
personal
and
secondly
because
in
my
opinion
the
perception
is
so
disorganised
or
more
precisely
so
differently
organised
from
the
one
i
have
during
the
usual
experience
that
the
writing
of
the
sensations
feelings
and
thoughts
i
have
in
a
strong
psychedelic
experience
is
usually
quite
inaccurate
and
not
very
precise

however
i
have
had
recently
two
trips
that
had
been
considerably
more
important
than
the
rest
and
they
are
so
stunning
that
i
think
it
could
be
nice
to
write
down
something
about
them
although
this
writing
is
short
imprecise
incomplete
and
inaccurate


even
though
both
trips
are
independent
and
can
be
read
separately
it
is
interesting
how
they
show
in
some
way
very
different
facets
of
the
psychedelic
experience
although
they
have
lots
of
things
in
common
too


the
first
trip

is
probably
the
most
powerful
experience
of
my
life
and
the
second
one
is
probably
the
best
and
most
beautiful
experience
of
my
life


so
after
this
introduction
lets
move
to
the
matter
of
this
experience
report
the
second
trip
---------

personal
background
i
am
a
quite
experienced
psychedelic
user
even
doing
psychedelics
almost
daily
or
very
regularly
in
some
periods
previous
to
this
trip
i
had
had
lots
of
experiences
specially
quite
a
lot
of
dmt
ones
including
strong
breakthroughs
i
had
also
experimented
with
trips
and
substances
in
different
contexts
and
settings


on
the
other
side
it
is
also
important
to
know
that
my
main
interest
in
life
is
geometry
also
other
parts
of
maths
in
the
sense
of
understanding
and
visualization
of
beautiful
complicated
stunning
and
new
geometrical
phenomena
related
to
intersections
hypersurfaces
higher
dimensions
etc
i
am
a
string/m-theory
and
algebraic
geometry
researcher

i
am
a
string/m-theory
and
algebraic
geometry
researcher

this
intellectual/professional
interest
is
also
my
main
interest
about
the
psychedelic
experience
and
without
it
you
cannot
understand
why
this
concrete
trip
was
so
significative
to
me

as
an
aside
it
is
normal
to
understand
part
of
my
interest
in
dmt
taking
into
account
its
visual
and
geometrical
richness
for
example
quoting
psychonautwiki
\x93the
geometry
present
with
smokeable
dmt
is
considered
by
many
to
be
the
most
profoundly
intricate
and
complex
set
of
visual
geometry
found
within
the
entirety
of
the
psychedelic
experience

setting
i
live
alone
in
my
house
on
this
occasion
i
was
sitting
at
my
desk
with
my
laptop
and
several
monitors
showing
different
images
papers
and
videos
about
nice
colourful
and
intricate
geometric
visualizations
including
representations
of
higher
dimensional
ones
the
lights
of
the
room
were
completely
on
i
wanted
a
bright
clear-coloured
scenario
and
although
it
was
quite
hot
i
was
wearing
a
lab
coat
for
two
reasons
i
love
hot
weather
and
the
coat
gives
a
futuristic
taste
for
my
imagination
i
had
been
thinking
and
meditating
abut
some
geometry
stuff
at
the
beginning
i
was
not
very
relaxed
but
neither
too
nervous

dosage
and
pre-trip
previous
to
the
main
trip
once
i
had
already
prepared
everything
i
did
a
first
trip

my
intention
was
doing
several
that
trip
was
also
quite
interesting
on
its
own
but
it
turned
to
be
just
a
prologue
of
what
was
going
to
happen

so
i
am
not
going
to
detail
it
here
i
smoked
slightly
more
than
40
mg
in
my
gvg
quite
properly
during
a
nice
time

it
was
considerably
powerful
and
i
had
quite
a
strong
breakthrough


i
am
unsure
if
i
took
several
hits
or
only
one
what
i
certainly
remember
is
that
by
the
time
i
started
to
feel
more
or
less
normal
i
was
still
a
bit
high
but
not
very
much
i
took
my
other
gvg
with
around
another
45
mg

of
dmt
then
the
main
trip
began

the
main
thing
i
was
transported
into
an
hyperdimensional
7-d
world
and
my
mind
was
amazed
in
happiness
and
saturated
in
a
good
way
in
geometrical
blooming
and
celebration

the
process
was
the
following
at
the
beginning
i
started
to
feel
heavy
specially
my
chest
and
shoulders
and
i
started
to
sink
in
my
chair
by
sliding
with
my
right
shoulder
following
kind-a-circular
path
at
the
same
time
the
visions
started
to
appear
and
a
new
scene
was
overcoming
the
physical
\x93real
world
a
circle
line
appeared
and
then
a
circular-like
yellow/orange/gold
figure/scene
started
to
emerge
at
that
moment
my
cited
path
followed
circular
directions
inside
this
figure/scene
then
the
figure/scene
became
more
ample
and
got
spherical
keeping
on
becoming
more
and
more
ample
gradually
as
this
was
happening
i
felt
a
bit
uncomfortable
because
i
felt
a
bit
trapped
i
almost
felt
like
a
physical
attraction
to
some
point
and
my
movement
capability
a
bit
limited
-in
fact
the
real
displacement
occurred
when
i
moved
in
a
touch
way
imagining
i
was
moving
my
shoulder/chest
i
felt
that
i
only
could
move
in
some
kind
of
circular
directions
contained
in
the
spherical-like
figure/scene
i
was
in*

but
that
feeling
of
uncomfortableness
lasted
quite
short
as
i
soon
realized
that
i
have
been
compactified
by
the
dmt
entities
the
sense
of
touch
played
an
interesting
role
in
this
compactification
process

*this
constraint
on
the
movement
dissapeared
later
when
the
hyperdimensional
character
of
the
scene
imposed
itself
by
that
moment
i
was
able
to
move
and
displace
freely
in
the
67
dimensions
or
i
had
a
delusion/perception
very
similar
to
that




i
had
the
eyes
closed
and
the
[ce]-vision
was
reaching
its
peak
in
that
moment
i
was
absolutely
amazed
and
exultant
and
just
by
the
moment
when
the
visions
reached
their
maximum
peak
i
was
submerged
in
a
complete
happiness
and
stunningness
because
as
i
said
***i
was
transported
into
an
hyperdimensional
7-d
world
and
my
mind
was
amazed
in
happiness
and
saturated
in
a
good
way
in
geometrical
blooming
and
celebration***

i
could
perceive
like
7
dimensions
at
the
same
time
there
were
a
4d
normal
scene
counting
time
as
a
dimension
plus
a
3d
scene
the
yellowish
kind
of
geometric
one
spherical
with
also
some
other
figures
--
maybe
some
kind
of
cylinders
arranged
across
different
hyperplanes
--
everywhere
and
both
of
them
were
overlapped
and
inserted
in
the
same
sight/scene/space
like
in
a
7-manifold
and
i
perceived
each
of
the
6
7
with
time
dimension
as
an
independent
direction
which
is
indeed
the
definition
of
dimension

i
have
just
said
that
i
i
saw
in
6
spatial
dimensions
probably
i
wouldn´t
say
so
but
it
was
a
very
similar
illusion
and
extremely
beautiful
and
stunning
there
were
several
dmt
effects
playing
a
role
at
least
these
three
and
more
of
them
for
sure
superposition
denser
image/space/reality
and
autosuggestion
of
extradimensional

perception

the
most
important
was
the
first
one
it
had
been
present
in
several
dmt
trips
but
in
this
time
it
was
elevated
to
its
maximum
power
to
the
point
of
being
almost
qualitatively
different


it
is
quite
useless
to
try
to
explain
the
entire
thing
but
i
can
inaccurately
describe
several
components
of
it
in
order
to
give
a
glimpse
one
partial
analogy
and
it
is
just
a
distorted
approximation
like
a
parably
or
a
projection
to
some
inferior
dimension
can
be
the
following
imagine
that
the
exterior
scene
and
the
exterior
dimensions
are
symbolized
by
a
rectangular
clear
blue
prism
3d
and
the
other
dimensions
are
symbolized
by
a
curved
yellow
cylinder
like
a
¼
of
a
slim
torus
counting
the
interior
of
it
so
we
have
another
3d
figure
and
an
a
result
3+3=6d

the
figures
are
arranged
like
in
this
figure



from
now
on
we
will
symbolize
our
focal
point
with
a
red
ball
i
will
refer
to
the
ball
in
the
following
but
you
have
to
have
in
mind
that
i
didn´t
see
a
physical
ball
it
is
just
to
mark
my
focal
point
what
happened
is
that
my
mind
interpreted
the
prism
and
the
torus
to
span
6
different
independent
dimensions
in
total
for
example
the
ball
could
move
to
the
front
in
the
cylinder
and
to
the
background
in
the
prism
at
the
same
time

to
understand
this
we
can
use
this
following
figure

imagine
that
you
see
at
time
t0
the
figure
0
then
you
see
at
time
t1
the
figure
1
and
at
time
2

the
figure
2
the
geometrical
perception
is
so
accelerated
blooming
rich
and
exalted
and
both
images
are
perceived
so
fast
with
such
a
short
period
of
time
t2-t1
that
the
brain
almost
thinks
that
it
perceives
them
at
the
same
time
so
it
interprets
that
both
the
ball
of
figure
1
and
the
ball
of
figure
2
are
the
same
ball

moving
at
the
same
time
both
along
the
direction
x5
in
the
prism
and
in
the
direction
-x3
in
the
cylinder
helped
by
the
autosuggestion
of
being
in
a
hyperdimensional
scene/sight
the
mind
thinks
that
that
is
possible
because
they
are
independent
dimensions
directions


i
had
done
a
breakthrough
as
the
reality
-
together
with
my
role
in
it
-
had
gone
completely
it
was
certainly
a
more
progressive
not
so
abrupt
breakthrough
than
the
average
of
my
breakthroughs
i
think
that
this
usually
happens
to
me
when
i
connect
two
breakthroughs
quite
nearby
in
time
in
such
a
way
that
i
don´t
give
enough
time
to
my
brain
to
stop
being
high
anyway

at
some
point
when
i
was
already
compactified
and
i
was
experiencing
the
hyperdimensional
thing
i
was
in
another
reality
i
was
in
the
hyperspace
but
in
this
time
unlike
the
other
trip
the
most
accentuated
facet
of
hyperspace
was
clearly
the
hyperdimensionality
rather
than
what
i
call
the
hyperreality
although
both
of
them
were
present

as
i
was
coming
back
to
reality
i
thought
that
the
dmt
entities
had
explained
to
me

and
let
me
feel
compactification
and
extra
dimensions
in
a
way
that
my
limited
brain
could
understand
i
had
perceived
with
all
the
senses
sight
touch
and
all
the
others
and
in
a
beautiful
way
the

67
different
dimensions
in
an
amazingly
beautiful
hyperdimensional
scene

then
the
visions
and
other
things
started
to
ease
off
little
by
little
as
long
as
the
main
thing
was
ending
i
started
crying
with
happiness
there
were
also
secondary
visions
i
do
not
remember
the
entire
thing
neither
all
the
visions
and
sensations
i
had
during
the
trip

i
certainly
remember
that
as
i
came
down
i
was
extremely
exultant
i
felt
like
my
neurons
were
saturated
in
joy
and
in
geometrical
richness

i
felt
like
my
neurons
were
saturated
in
joy
and
in
geometrical
richness

i
was
crying
for
happiness
and
when
i
closed
my
eyes
lots
of
3d
multi-colloured
geometrical
figures
formed
lots
of
planes
and
other
things
turned
around
and
intersects
among
them
in
incredibly
beautiful
ways
they
came
to
the
center
of
the
image
and
spheres
arose
in
their
intersections
from
the
center
and
expanded
along
all
the
image
this
image
lasted
quite
more
than
usual
when
i
am
becoming
sober

all
the
experience
it
was
so
so
so
extremely
beautiful
so
amazing
i
didn´t
know
i
could
ever
experience
that
amount
of
beauty
it
was
so
pleasant
and
beautiful
that
after
all
the
first
thing
i
did
when
i
recover
my
consciousness
was
crying
with
hapinness
and
sob
\x93so
beautiful
\x93oh
my
god
i
even
screamt
a
crazy
strong
shout

\x93it
is
so
beautiful
god
gooooooooood
in
fact
i
recorded
some
of
the
reflections
descriptions
also
some
of
the
sobs
and
screams
to
capture
a
bit
of
the
moment
and
help
me
to
remember
some
things

as
an
aside
it
is
interesting
to
remark
that
i
am
a
person
with
a
very
pro-futuristic
world
attitude
in
the
sense
that
i
believe
in
transhumanity
mind
uploading
and
other
scientific
marvels
and
i
think
that
in
remote
future
human
beings
will
be
able
to
live
perceive
and
feel
extraordinary
mathematical
scientific
stethical
[esthetic]
experiences
in
this
context
the
experience
in
this
report
encouraged
me
even
more
to
keep
on
exploring
geometry
string/m-theory
algebraic
geometry
mathematics
etc
and
to
try
to
participate
in
that
future


it
is
interesting
that
to
maintain
this
kind
of
experience
as
a
constant
state
of
the
brain
would
be
quite
similar
to
some
kind
of
paradise
maybe
it
will
have
to
be
complemented

with
some
elements
or
inputs
that
help
to
maintain
a
constant
train
of
thoughts
if
necessary
because
even
though
lots
of
rich
conexions
appear
in
the
psychedelic
experience
they
sometimes
manifest
a
lack
of
linearity
and
focus
in
some
aspects
which
would
be
nice
to
be
enhanced
or
corrected

also
in
a
slightly
more
practical
way
i
will
explore
geometrically
some
of
the
visual/geometrical/perceptive
effects
and
thoughts

that
appeared
in
the
trip
and
they
could
also
be
useful
in
the
future
in
the
context
of
trying
to
build
illusions
or
simulations
of
hyperdimensional
perception
however
regarding
this
direction
it
seems
complicated
to
accurately
replicate
this
kind
of
illusions
without
the
component
of
autosuggestion
of
the
brain
that
had
been
present
in
this
trip
it
would
need
lots
of
precision

at
last
i
had
had
the
mythical-unimaginable-indescribable-best-experience-ever
that
changes
your
life
i
had
always
read
about
in
some
dmt
and
other
psychedelics
reports
i
didn´t
expect
it
after
so
many
trips
and
psychedelic
experiences
which
i
had
had
in
quite
different
moods
and
moments
this
eventuality
could
be
caused
by
different
things
and
of
course
pure
luck
played
a
role
one
of
them
may
be
that
i
had
had
some
of
the
obsessions
and
loops/bad
ways
of
thinking
i
was
worried
about
previously
like
the
ones
previous
to

the
other
trip
i
reported

anyway
it
was
incredible

now
after
all
of
that
i
almost
don´t
know
what
to
do
it
is
like
\x93you
have
been
born
raised
thought
felt
worked
and
now
you
have
lived
that
so
it
is
ok
you
can
already
die
in
fact
some
days
later
i
took
a
plane
and
when
it
was
taking
off
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
if
the
plane
accidentally
crashes
i
wouldn´t
be
very
worried
i
can
pass
away
quite
realized
and
satisfied
ahahahaha

on
the
other
side
i
had
let
a
quite
long
period
of
time
and
still
some
time
left
in
order
to
assimilate
it
enjoy
and
celebrate
what
i
have
lived
let
it
rest
integrate
it
write
a
bit
about
it
etc
once
i
have
done
a
partial
analysis
i
almost
surely
will
keep
on
doing
psychedelics
but
this
was
indeed
a
profound
before
and
after

-
multi-day
experience

preface
i
am
a
young
man
who
tries
to
stay
healthy
and
live
a
positive
life
recently
i
had
been
in
a
bit
of
a
slump
from
which
i
needed
to
get
out
of
i
have
prior
experience
with
most
\x93commonly
known
drugs
with
the
exception
of
lsd
not
that
im
opposed
to
it
and
have
some
experience
with
a
few
lesser
known
rcs
this
is
the
story
of
a
revelatory
week
which
reminded
me
of
the
beauty
and
connectedness
of
everything
as
one
other
characters
in
the
story
are
g
who
i
had
known
for
a
few
years
who
had
no
prior
psych
experience
taken
mdma
twice
alcohol
and
cannabis
b
and
i
have
been
close
friends
for
3
years
and
weve
chewed
shrooms
a
few
times
together
rolled
a
couple
times
and
in
the
two
weeks
prior
to
this
we
had
tried
ketamine
for
the
first
time
and
on
another
occasion
had
another
beautiful
afternoon
where
he
took
2c-b
and
i
took
2c-t-2

friday
it
was
the
last
day
of
classes
and
i
had
had
glowing
experiences
on
such
days
there
was
a
fair
number
of
psychedelics
i
had
in
possession
but
the
one
which
i
wanted
to
give
highest
priority
was
dmt
i
had
200mg
total
of
a
fluffy
almost
waxy
powder
one
of
my
best
friends
call
him
b
was
also
curious
but
felt
it
wasnt
the
right
day
for
him
the
day
went
as
usual
relaxing
smoking
some
bud
until
another
friend
call
her
g
who
id
known
for
a
few
years
through
b
but
only
ever
shared
brief
encounters
with
came
over
which
was
happening
more
usual
than
lately
and
i
had
been
getting
to
know
her
better
a
coincidence
was
noticed
amongst
the
group
how
she
seemed
to
fill
the
\x93place
of
another
friend
of
ours
who
had
recently
gone
abroad
and
naturally
we
gently
missed
him
g
was
also
wanting
to
blow
off
steam
with
classes
being
over
and
suggested
mdma
which
i
also
happened
to
have
a
moderate
amount
of
b
and
g
are
both
down
to
roll
so
i
decide
its
probably
time
to
talk
to
dimitri
i
first
pack
each
b
and
g
a
capsule
of
140mg
and
a
cap
of
80mg
i
pack
myself
one
cap
of
170mg
in
case
i
want
to
roll
after
i
come
down
who
wouldnt
want
to
roll
with
a
bunch
of
friends
i
dose
out
48mg
of
the
dmt
into
a
vape
i
made
using
a
glass
tube
and
a
bunch
of
pipe
screens
and
adapted
it
to
fit
our
bong

dmt
part
i
breakthrough
b
and
i
escape
to
the
empty
room
left
by
the
aforementioned
friend
which
still
cosily
had
a
bed
a
couple
chairs
and
table
hes
going
to
spot
i
take
my
last
breaths
calm
myself
then
i
gave
it
all
i
could
and
cleared
the
bong
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
and
held
my
breath
as
long
as
i
could
and
as
soon
as
i
exhaled
things
started
getting
really
shroomy
but
before
i
could
even
think
that
i
was
launched
off
and
then
there
was
an
overwhelming
rush
of
just
everything
all
at
once
before
i
knew
it
i
was
in
what
ill
call
the
sea
of
knowledge/flow
of
conscience
which
was
immensely
beautiful
on
its
own
but
then
i
was
met
by
what
seemed
like
a
gnome
but
i
never
really
saw
a
body
or
appendages
because
he
was
wearing
a
top
hat
that
was
the
most
incredible
thing
and
he
took
me
around
that
realm
giving
me
this
sneaky
grin
every
time
i
would
realize
something
new
i
asked
him
to
tell
me
something
i
couldnt
possibly
know
in
a
sense
to
test
the
local/non-local
source
of
the
effects
he
revealed
something
to
me
which
exploded
into
bursts
of
light
and
extremely
complex
geometries
once
the
fanfare
was
over
i
found
myself
in
an
endless
yet
somehow
compact
\x93zebra
patterned
box
world
i
tried
to
grasp
at
what
he
told
me
but
i
had
forgotten
it


the
whole
experience
moved
very
quickly
and
i
soon
left
the
box
and
just
found
myself
staring
at
a
flower
that
kept
morphing
into
other
objects
in
the
foreground
of
yet
an
even
more
highly
complex
red-orange
pattern
i
slowly
start
to
come
back
to
reality
i
begin
to
feel
my
body
again
but
the
walls
are
moving
and
drooping
all
over
the
place
with
flashing
circles
of
light
around
objects
in
the
room
and
tracers/afterimages
galore
eventually
i
feel
grounded
enough
and
look
over
at
b
and
say
\x93whoa
that
was
awesome
he
says
\x9310
minutes
on
the
dot
looking
down
at
the
timer
on
his
phone
\x93wow
you
really
could
do
it
on
a
lunch
break

mdma
part
one
manifestations
g
and
b
had
popped
the
first
caps
and
feeling
as
great
as
i
did
from
being
shown
into
such
a
rare
realm
i
threw
mine
back
too
i
couldnt
feel
any
more
at
peace
right
now
and
i
still
have
to
look
forward
to
some
more
delightful
chemical
intoxication
g
had
been
chilling
in
bs
room
while
we
were
away
and
it
was
starting
to
hit
her
nicely
she
asks
how
the
dmt
was
and
i
explain
it
starting
to
feel
the
m
come
up
creeping
on
we
go
chill
and
hit
a
few
bowls
in
the
other
room
all
of
us
really
starting
to
feel
it
we
fold
down
a
futon
and
bundle
up
in
a
cozy
heap
all
jumbled
together
there
was
an
extremely
erotic
energy
in
the
room
but
not
really
in
a
sexual
way
i
was
pretty
sure
neither
b
nor
i
would
not
be
able
get
hard
cause
of
the
m
anyways
everyone
just
enjoyed
the
presence
of
the
others
and
we
felt
into
this
bliss
for
a
while


the
idea
came
up
that
we
b
and
i
had
manifested
g
into
our
lives
to
replace
the
void
that
our
other
friend
had
left
this
spiralled
off
onto
more
sexy
conversation
about
how
we
are
all
just
products
of
the
energy
we
give
off/surround
ourselves
with
g
realizes
several
hours
have
passed
and
that
they
still
have
the
supplemental
cap
b
and
i
feel
fine
but
g
figured
it
was
worth
taking
since
we
had
it
she
swallows
hers
and
coaxes
b
to
take
his
by
pretending
to
pop
it
herself
too
b
complies
and
takes
his


i
remember
reading
in
pihkal
about
how
2c-b
was
given
near
the
end
of
mdma
sessions
and
brought
back
both
effects
with
more
power
so
i
decided
to
rail
5mg
2c-b
mixed
with
5mg
mdma
yes
it
burned
for
a
little
while
but
it
didnt
bother
me
too
much
even
nose
pain
can
feel
fantastic
when
rolling
we
decide
to
go
get
some
snacks
and
smokes
at
the
corner
store
so
we
bundled
up
winter
and
headed
out
i
was
coming
back
up
and
i
was
starting
to
feel
the
cartoony
feel
of
the
2c-b
coming
on
as
we
walk
its
like
i
havent
felt
closer
to
people
especially
b
and
g
and
could
never
do
harm
to
anyone
nearing
the
store
in
the
distance
i
see
the
light
of
the
sign
and
it
takes
the
image
of
the
gnome
from
the
dmt
but
just
his
little
sneaky
grin
telling
me
that
he
leaves
that
hat
at
home
we
get
the
supplies
and
head
back
futon
cozy-up
is
back
as
were
all
seeming
to
peak
again
we
enjoy
in
our
delights
and
have
a
fantastic
rest
of
the
evening
at
this
point
i
realize
im
stretching
it
but
as
a
night
cap
i
rail
5mg
of
2c-t-2
on
the
second
comedown
as
it
has
been
reported
to
be
used
in
the
same
way
as
mentioned
about
2c-b
this
ones
a
real
burn
5mg
is
more
material
than
the
5mg
of
2c-b
makes
sense
but
it
starts
to
come
on
right
away
beautiful
cevs
fill
my
sight
when
i
close
my
eyes
and
wonderful
patchwork
geometry
was
appearing
around
the
walls
i
was
in
control
of
energies
around
and
was
very
much
able
to
control
even
the
color
and
behaviour
of
the
patterning
i
kept
enjoying
these
tricks
i
had
and
felt
so
blissful
and
connected
to
everything
eventually
i
had
to
crash
but
still
got
to
enjoy
the
beautiful
hypnagogic
imagery
as
i
floated
away
to
bed

saturday
i
awoke
at
a
fairly
early
time
quite
unusual
especially
since
i
had
no
reason
to
and
had
been
up
all
night
i
wouldnt
say
that
i
felt
any
worse
than
i
would
have
if
i
had
just
gotten
that
little
sleep
on
its
own
i
usually
keep
things
like
5-htp
on
hand
for
these
times
but
i
didnt
have
any
then
i
cooked
myself
a
bunch
of
eggs
and
toast
and
took
it
with
a
bit
of
vitamin
b6
i
believe
2c-t-2
has
suspect
maoi
activity
but
i
knew
some
tyramine
would
get
my
levels
back
to
normal
i
head
over
to
bs
house
which
tends
to
be
the
usual
hangout
we
hit
a
few
bowls
and
talk
about
how
great
last
night
was
and
we
still
feel
really
good
g
comes
over
and
we
all
genuinely
agreed
that
we
missed
each
other
g
says
that
the
mdma
had
made
her
think
in
a
completely
different
and
way
more
positive/beneficial
way
she
wanted
to
do
it
again
tonight
i
made
sure
she
knew
the
effects
would
certainly
be
diminished
2
days
in
a
row
but
she
kept
interested
in
a
way
we
all
did
have
that
missing
link
in
the
circle
from
the
previous
night
or
maybe
just
the
hedonistic
mood
wed
been
in
we
decided
to
roll
again
i
weigh
out
the
m
i
have
left
and
it
doesnt
look
like
itll
be
enough
for
all
of
us
well
need
more
g
knows
a
connect
and
before
we
know
were
off
to
get
500mg
i
had
180mg
left
of
the
previous
stuff
that
i
will
take
i
scale
b
and
g
off
each
150mg
and
60mg
sup
this
time
the
timing
will
be
better
but
i
decide
before
dropping
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
dmt
realm

dmt
part
2
time
tourist
in
the
same
setting
i
throw
back
the
rip
as
best
as
i
can
there
seems
to
be
more
residue
left
than
last
time
i
cleaned
it
between
uses
and
the
taste
is
slightly
more
acrid
after
the
exhale
wonderful
things
began
happening
again
color
bursts
from
all
over
the
room
and
i
get
a
somewhat
tense
feeling
then
a
buzzing
deep
in
me
that
kept
growing
i
thought
that
this
would
build
to
liftoff
and
breakthrough
but
the
rocket
just
fizzled
a
little
and
had
to
abort
the
tension
lifted
and
then
i
felt
like
i
was
being
shown
the
history
of
civilization
and
all
the
art/visuals
associated
with
all
the
cultures
of
the
world
and
the
same
morphing
flower
from
the
first
time
which
was
everything
appeared
again
but
blocking
my
entrance
into
hyperspace
this
time
the
trip
continued
on
more
reinforcing
the
one-ness
of
conscience
life
as
an
entity
i
was
still
far
gone
but
started
to
talk
to
b
\x93its
still
going
on
a
fair
bit
but
i
didnt
breakthrough
this
time
\x93youre
around
six
and
a
half
minutes
after
interacting
i
was
effectively
grounded
again
but
still
got
to
take
in
the
walls
melt
and
shift
they
were
covered
in
glowing
green
script
written
in
a
language
that
doesnt
exist
or
never
been
known
and
i
was
trying
to
comprehend
what
they
were
saying
until
i
returned
to
baseline
about
10
min
later

mdma
part
2
both
sides

none
of
us
had
rolled
more
than
3
times
prior
to
this
so
naturally
its
use
tied
to
clubs/raves/festivals
gives
it
its
bad
name
we
had
all
agreed
from
the
night
before
that
the
far
more
powerful
use
of
it
was
for
psychotherapy
but
tonight
there
was
a
bit
of
a
rager
happening
with
some
djs
i
know
spinning
all
night
so
that
was
on
the
agenda
if
we
were
feeling
it


we
relax
and
hit
a
couple
bowls
but
its
starting
to
come
on
g
exclaims
\x93whoa
it
just
hit
me
really
hard
and
then
i
just
felt
a
huge
energy
rush
as
well
i
said
\x93well
both
focus
tell
me
the
letter
of
the
alphabet
im
thinking
of
we
focused
on
it
and
she
said
fairly
confidently
\x93r
my
jaw
dropped
to
the
floor
that
was
the
letter
we
exist
on
this
really
high
energy
and
everyone
is
fantastic


we
popped
the
second
pills
there
was
some
left
and
g
gave
me
the
last
85mg
but
they
said
this
stuff
was
a
bit
speedier
than
mine
but
still
pretty
good
we
had
a
few
beers
and
headed
for
one
of
my
buddys
sets
the
music
is
kicking
great
im
full
of
energy
to
dance
and
my
inhibitions
are
a
bit
lower
so
im
more
confident
around
everyone
i
can
only
complain
about
my
jaw
clenching
but
im
aware
of
it
and
can
keep
it
at
bay
i
run
into
a
friend
i
havent
seen
in
years
who
also
happened
to
drop
tonight
it
didnt
even
matter
what
we
talked
about
it
seemed
to
get
me
more
caught
up
and
connected
to
him
now
b
g
and
i
jam
there
for
a
while
but
really
we
all
just
wanted
to
go
back
to
cuddle-land
on
the
futon
we
finished
the
drinks
there
and
headed
home
we
were
flipping
through
netflix
and
saw
the
movie
\x93the
secret
g
had
heard
of
and
read
bits
of
the
book
i
had
heard
of
the
book
and
movie
but
probably
passed
it
off
as
ridiculous
or
something
it
was
funny
to
come
across
it
because
that
was
the
exact
way
we
had
been
feeling
things
worked
basically
the
principle
boils
down
to
attracting
positivity
by
being
positive
and
actual
faith/belief
that
what
you
want
is
yours
because
it
is
we
all
made
lists
of
what
we
wanted
to
see
happen
modest
things
or
just
for
the
hell
of
it
mundane
as
be
a
good
day
today
to
whiting
out
bank
statements
and
putting
in
false
huge
numbers
hoping
that
those
numbers
will
somehow
actualize

sunday





i
wake
up
sunday
its
a
beautiful
day
b
willed
it
on
his
list
and
i
have
a
text
from
a
girl
i
had
been
seeing
casually
it
wasnt
going
anywhere
and
i
hadnt
spoke
to
her
in
a
while
but
the
text
basically
said
she
understood
we
were
coming
from
different
places
and
wed
both
find
someone
better
coincidentally
i
had
randomly
added
\x93new
girl
interests
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
before
bed
weird
there
is
a
banquet
tonight
so
everyone
is
dressing
up
and
well
have
about
40
people
there
b
g
and
i
will
all
be
there
together
the
night
is
great
while
everyone
catches
up
b
is
trying
to
bring
people
in
on
our
revelation
but
i
really
do
think
one
has
to
actually
feel
a
powerful
experience
to
benefit
from
such
notions
we
end
the
night
with
a
nice
buzz
going
from
drinking
and
blazing
talking
about
all
these
sexy
ideas
ive
tripped
with
b
a
fair
bit
before
and
his
trips
focus
a
lot
around
death
so
discussing
that
transition
was
a
fair
part
of
the
analysis

monday
monday
is
fairly
mundane
we
are
all
still
at
really
high
energies
and
feel
fantastic
as
just
cogs
in
the
fantastic
cosmic
machine

tuesday
i
have
some
studying
to
do
and
from
experience
2c-i
has
a
fairly
clean
stimulation
only
small
body
load
so
i
weigh
out
4mg
and
take
it
with
a
choline
supplement
and
a
few
racetams
studying
is
going
well
as
i
feel
concentrated
thinking
is
easy
and
time
is
slower
i
get
a
message
from
b
telling
me
hes
ready
for
the
dmt
so
i
bring
it
over
g
is
there
and
embraces
me
saying
how
good
it
is
to
see
me
we
talk
a
bit
but
almost
immediately
b
says
he
is
feeling
different
almost
like
he
is
rolling
and
his
energy
is
really
good
i
remember
the
excerpt
in
pihkal
on
2c-i
of
someone
experiencing
a
contact
high
at
a
session
when
they
took
none
so
i
tell
him
that
i
took
4mg
as
a
nootropic
at
first
he
is
sceptical
but
i
show
him
the
excerpt
and
he
says
he
feels
undeniably
high
its
quite
remarkable
we
talk
a
bit
about
my
experience
and
then
47mg
weighed
out
and
ready


b
and
i
retreat
to
his
room
he
takes
the
hit
but
it
seems
to
have
left
a
bit
more
residue
and
he
has
a
bit
of
trouble
clearing
it
he
falls
back
in
his
bed
as
he
exhales
and
i
see
him
start
to
grin
a
few
minutes
in
he
looks
to
me
extending
his
hand
telling
me
\x93you
have
courage
i
nod
thanking
him
saying
nothing
he
continues
for
a
little
while
before
asking
where
g
is
and
to
get
her
i
summon
g
and
she
comes
to
observe
she
doesnt
know
what
to
make
of
b
at
the
moment
asking
\x93is
he
still
on
it
i
nod
and
try
to
indicate
to
be
quiet/not
to
be
distracting
b
is
baseline
about
12
minutes
after
the
hit
he
says
he
didnt
breakthrough
but
also
still
had
a
phenomenal
experience
he
said
that
he
was
telling
me
i
had
courage
because
we
were
going
to
die
and
i
was
going
with
him
but
then
it
didnt
happen
he
concludes
he
has
a
big
ego
and
that
an
ego-death
type
experience
would
have
to
be
\x93the
gnarliest
thing
ever
i
would
really
have
to
believe
i
was
dying
to
which
i
respond
\x93thats
the
point
and
the
harder
you
hold
the
more
visceral
it
will
be
b
has
always
doubted
the
visual
effects
of
psychs
saying
they
certainly
mess
with
his
head
but
he
doesnt
see
anything
that
a
sober
person
couldnt
witness
always
rationalizing
the
effects
down
to
light
bouncing
or
shadows
that
other
people
are
too
busy
to
see
ive
tried
to
convey
that
thats
what
part
of
the
visuals
are
and
the
nature
of
the
light/shadows
is
being
played
on
by
the
chemical
and
your
perception
of
it
after
the
dmt
he
is
convinced
but
sees
dmt
at
another
level
than
other
psychs
to
each
their
own
b
has
been
curious
about
lsd
for
said
accompanying
visuals
but
none
of
us
have
tried
it


i
say
2c-e
is
purported
to
be
quite
visual
which
i
happen
to
have
and
as
one
the
magical
half-dozen
may
be
a
powerful
tool
none
of
us
have
prior
experience
with
it
but
ive
done
research
and
warn
them
that
its
a
real
psych
even
more
so
than
2c-b
which
b
thoroughly
enjoyed
we
all
do
some
more
research
and
decide
that
well
imbibe
i
say
22mg
b
says
18mg
g
is
a
bit
on
the
fence
but
says
to
pack
her
12mg
as
i
go
to
prepare
it
colors
and
textures
of
buildings
are
saturated
like
no
other
and
there
is
a
beautiful
gradient
in
the
sky
and
its
not
even
a
nice
day
i
remember
the
2c-i
and
i
realize
its
is
doing
more
than
i
thought
i
decide
to
play
it
safe
and
pack
myself
a
smaller
12mg
dose
instead

2c-e
day
5
rebirth
b
and
i
take
our
doses
but
g
decides
to
wait
a
bit
and
see
how
we
react
b
thinks
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
watch
the
movie
samsara
which
are
just
visuals
from
all
over
the
world
depicting
humanity
from
its
highs
to
lows
he
believes
it
is
on
youtube
so
we
search
but
we
end
up
starting
watching
some
other
movie
about
actual
samsara
in
eastern
religions
20
min
in
we
realise
this
isnt
the
movie
we
were
looking
for
and
turn
it
off
we
flip
the
lights
on
and
right
away
i
see
patterns
all
over
the
walls
all
the
cracks
on
the
floor
were
shifting
and
melting
b
says
hes
starting
to
feel
it
too
g
takes
hers
and
we
put
on
some
music


were
in
cozy
futon
mode
relaxing
hitting
a
few
bowls
when
b
starts
to
get
uneasy
he
flips
back
and
forth
between
thinking
whether
he
is
depressed
or
not
we
try
to
talk
him
through
it
by
finding
the
source
of
the
depression
b
would
think
about
it
say
that
there
wasnt
anything
so
he
couldnt
be
depressed
he
would
then
cycle
back
to
before
and
the
same
idea
started
again
b
began
the
get
extremely
anxious
and
was
verging
on
a
panic
attack
i
offered
him
3mg
of
xanax
which
g
agreed
would
definitely
help
but
it
proved
very
difficult
to
get
b
to
take
it
because
he
was
hung
up
on
his
ability
to
do
anything
he
wanted
and
he
was
trapped
thinking
about
what
to
do
he
also
believed
that
we
were
in
some
way
tricking
or
testing
him
as
projections
from
his
own
mind
with
enough
coping
while
he
briefly
snapped
out
of
it
we
convinced
him
to
take
it
as
soon
as
he
took
it
he
said
he
instantly
felt
eased
but
then
fell
back
into
the
trip
i
tell
g
that
barring
him
throwing
up
itll
take
effect
in
15-20
min
i
wait
it
out
and
the
xanax
starts
to
bring
him
down
a
bit
he
is
no
longer
as
anxious
but
he
says
he
doesnt
want
to
feel
the
drug
anymore
i
remind
him
that
its
a
journey
and
now
that
youre
on
it
you
have
to
ride
it
out
things
seem
more
under
control
so
i
slip
out
to
the
store
for
a
minute
before
they
close
when
i
return
b
is
still
dealing
with
having
to
ride
out
the
effects
but
g
and
i
assure
well
be
here
the
whole
time
for
him
we
are
all
quite
inebriated
and
cuddle
up
with
few
clothes
on
neither
b
nor
i
are
gay/bi
but
neither
us
cared
and
it
didnt
matter
it
was
just
what
was
nice
to
be
in
everyones
presence
hands
felt
all
around
and
nobody
cared
for
whose
limbs
were
whose
we
were
all
just
one
we
all
felt
like
we
reborn
over
and
over
again
by
each
other
and
it
was
incredible
b
was
glowing
he
said
there
were
visuals
and
energy
everywhere
and
he
could
manipulate
it
at
will
with
his
hands
or
thought

wednesday
we
didnt
get
much
sleep
because
we
were
too
excited
about
a
sense
of
enlightenment
we
all
felt
about
how
we
all
are
part
of
the
same
conscious
flow
capable
of
anything
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
reconstructing
the
experience
as
we
bathed
in
the
2c-es
afterglow
b
realized
the
depression
he
was
confused
about
was
caused
by
that
sense
of
loneliness
of
only
being
one
but
after
he
had
gotten
through
it
in
his
trip
he
embraced
the
oneness
and
the
depression
disappeared
completely

thursday
the
next
day
g
left
town
for
a
few
days
and
b
and
i
were
still
in
awe
of
our
discovery
in
light
of
the
telepathy
from
the
other
night
when
g
got
the
letter
correct
we
tried
it
with
a
number
between
1-10
he
was
to
think
and
i
would
guess
after
some
concentration
i
said
3
confidently
to
which
b
nodded
it
was
correct
our
other
buddy
s
who
had
been
around
a
bit
over
the
past
days
but
had
not
partook
in
anything
was
with
us
so
we
upped
the
stakes
s
and
i
would
guess
bs
number
1-20
after
some
concentration
we
wrote
our
answers
down
s
and
i
both
said
14
while
b
had
chosen
16
we
text
the
question
to
g
and
we
all
focus
on
16
until
she
responded
she
guessed
17
we
upped
the
stakes
again
s
and
b
left
the
room
and
picked
a
number
1-25
together
came
back
and
concentrated
i
said
6
and
the
two
of
them
flew
off
the
walls
because
it
was
correct
b
starts
wondering
what
it
could
work
with
he
tells
me
that
he
is
envisioning
a
color
behind
his
closed
eyes
and
if
i
could
see
it
i
concentrate
and
begin
to
see
green
i
announce
it
and
b
nods
again
with
a
huge
smile
across
his
face
he
texts
his
ex
and
asks
her
to
think
of
a
color
and
a
time
she
spent
with
him
then
text
the
color
we
await
the
response
and
when
it
comes
before
we
look
i
ask
s
if
he
wants
to
know
my
guess
i
whisper
in
his
ear
purple
and
he
coughs
on
his
water
saying
that
what
he
thought
bs
ex
responds
saying
hes
crazy
maybe
another
time
b
said
he
was
thinking
fuchsia
i
cant
say
that
i
was
ever
in
control
of
the
power
but
i
wasnt
just
making
mere
guesses
and
experienced
it

extensions
this
was
a
magical
week
that
i
would
describe
on
whole
as
a
++++
experience
it
rekindled
and
reminded
me
of
the
mystical
experience
i
had
the
first
time
i
tried
mescaline
4
years
prior
my
first
and
only
other
++++
experience
i
dont
think
i
would
have
benefitted
as
much
had
b
not
gotten
there
as
it
was
incredible
to
witness
and
it
made
me
feel
extremely
blessed
by
all
experiences
that
ive
had




i
smoked
dmt
the
other
afternoon
and
remembered
that
everything
really
is
ok

it
may
be
a
struggle
to
realize
that
at
times
but
this
would
only
be
due
to
what
i
may
impose
upon
the
limitations
of
my
consciousness

so
i
may
as
well
recount
this
recent
memory
of
eternal
unburdening
before
the
accrual
of
personal
consciousness
obscures
me
of
the
bigger
picture

here
it
goes

i
waved
goodbye
to
my
room-mate
feeling
a
body
load
swiftly
build
upon
me

i
cleared
the
rest
of
the
smoke
as
i
could
and
put
the
empty
bong
down

a
shimmer
was
noted
in
everything
i
saw
in
each
and
every
point
of
my
environment

geometric
images
of
manifold
designs
began
to
appear
and
move
along
every
alignment
possible
i
closed
my
eyes
pondering
how
the
world
my
eyes
perceived
was
but
a
narrow
portion
of
the
real
world
that
my
sensory
apparati
could
detect
moments
after
that
real
event
had
actually
occurred

my
eyelids
closed
to
shut
out
the
world
limited
by
them
and
my
mind
was
subsumed
into
direct
experience
of
a
reality
beyond
my
comprehensions

i
did
not
see
a
cosmic
elf
trying
to
gift
me
or
feel
hugged
by
the
clouds
as
my
roommate
had
recounted
his
own
experience
on
the
chemical

i
did
however
completely
lose
my
body

aware
only
of
my
vision
smile
and
physical
feeling
of
infinitude
i
was
not
otherwise
contained

i
was
a
part
of
the
world
reflecting
on
itself

the
world
was
more
vast
than
imaginable
yet
simplified
enormously

a
bright
luminous
sun
glowed
no
more
brightly
than
the
green
hills
that
the
sky
sloped
into

noting
a
sensation
of
encapsulation
it
seemed
i
was
as
central
to
this
sphere
as
any
other
point
within
it

my
world
and
sky
were
one

this
world
did
not
exist
for
me
with
machinery
as
many
dmt
smokers
may
report
and
had
actually
lacked
all
angles
as
they
had
been
known
to
me

the
curvature
was
sublimely
unending
a
dynamic
unfurling
of
luminous
wonder

if
angles
were
to
be
conceived
it
was
as
a
vector
may
each
point
i
would
reflect
upon
would
sparkle
as
though
a
hologram

this
seemed
to
be
the
arising
between
the
intersection
of
worlds

yes
this
was
a
place
primordial
to
time
of
consequence
yet
a
place
of
confluence
where
these
and
all
other
things
passed
inconsequentially
through
each
other

this
world
laughed
at
my
sense
of
cause
and
effect

referred
to
as
the
businessman
lunch
due
to
its
metabolic
brevity
when
smoked
i
had
45
minutes
to
burn
until
baked
potatoes
needed
interference
i
thought
nothing
before
experiencing
the
dmt

this
silly
thought
of
a
responsibility
aside
from
wonderment
of
which
i
was
an
inextricable
part
intruded
my
appreciation
of
this
world

\x93the
potatoes
some
stubborn
part
of
my
lucid
mind
would
assert

i
would
open
my
eyes
to
see
the
digital
clock
suspended
within
the
well-intended
mockery
of
the
realler
world

of
course
my
roommate
would
be
responsible
if
need
be
for
me

the
entire
arch
of
my
trajectories
from
and
to
presuppositions
of
cause
and
effect
was
undermined
by
the
immanency
and
utter
depth
of
the
world
beneath
it

it
is
ok
the
world
would
remark
as
the
conscience
of
my
guilty
self

is
ok
was
ok
will
be
ok
ok
is
eternal
and
this
joy
is
ever
flowing
this
world
would
calmly
whisper

a
black
field

i
am
ensconced
but
know
of
nothing
other
than
vision

i
see
black

then
and
i
am
sure
for
this
happened
several
times
so
similar
but
never
identical
the
most
adorable
invitingly
furry
bipedal
creature
that
i
had
ever
seen
walks
from
right
to
left

best
resembling
a
lemur
or
other
prosimian
animal
with
supernaturally
cute
features
this
object
of
my
endearment
walks
from
right
to
left
with
purpose

before
reaching
its
destination
it
looks
to
its
left
and
meets
me
in
the
eye

this
is
where
things
unexpected
enter

the
animal
astounded
by
the
creatures
reaction

it
looks
at
me
with
astonishment
clear
from
its
physical
and
facial
reactions

i
recognize
that
look
the
creature
bounds
over
to
me
kneels
down
and
begins
to
pet
me
as
though
i
am
the
most
adorable
creature
it
has
ever
beheld

although
hands
feet
and
body
in
general
had
ceased
to
exist
for
some
time
now
i
was
aware
of
this
creatures
enfolding
embrace

it
felt
so
good
to
be
pet
and
loved
as
i
loved
so
much
my
insides
were
utterly
tickled

the
smile
i
wore
seemed
larger
than
all
space

my
grin
seemed
to
wrap
around
my
everything
keeping
me
warm

this
happened
several
times
in
each
rendition
the
muppet
projection
of
myself
diverted
from
its
straight
and
narrow
path
to
love
the
unexpected
beauty
it
had
nearly
passed

my
breath
was
realized
for
what
seemed
the
first
time
in
ages

it
felt
so
good
to
simply
aspirate

to
take
in
the
world
my
eyes
still
closed
to
breath
in
my
environment
i
became
more
myself

i
and
environment
were
not
so
separate

my
legs
returned
and
i
felt
my
seat

the
grin
though
still
cast
wider
than
the
horizon
could
be
localized
to
my
cheeks

i
began
to
talk
with
my
roommate
first
uttering
\x93thank
you
and
i
love
you

my
life
was
changed
\x93like
a
born
again
christian
a
dear
friend
justly
summarized
for
me

the
world
beneath
my
fingertips
tapping
on
a
key
board
playing
a
violin
of
the
cilia
in
my
ears
with
the
vibrations
of
the
air
sliding
down
my
nose
in
the
form
of
prescription
glasses
my
sense
of
what
is
important
in
the
context
of
things
everything
i
feel
to
be
real
in
the
world
of
death
and
taxes-
none
of
this
is
more
compelling
than
that
richer
realm
facilitated
through
dmt

this
world
is
simply
more
accessible
than
that
other
world
but
no
more
real
to
my
mind
than
the
other

going
back
to
my
last
cogent
thought
before
the
chemical
took
hold
entirely
my
real
world
composed
of
dear
people
known
and
unknown
to
but
entirely
apart
of
myself
is
a
sliver
of
the
past

vibrations
of
sound
traveling
through
the
air
a
photons
journey
from
the
event
to
my
eye
even
the
sensations
of
my
very
skin
are
delayed
as
they
are
transmitted
to
the
awareness
of
my
mind

our
window
is
too
narrow
to
take
it
all
in
and
the
grand
breeze
of
what
is
will
not
hit
us
until
squeezing
through
the
prison
of
our
subjective
removal
from
reality

we
wont
know
what
is
going
on
until
it
becomes
a
fragmentary
history
distorted
by
our
conclusions
of
it

this
is
what
is
so
accessible
a
set
incapable
of
inducing
conclusions
of
how
wide
an
array
existence
may
take

i
think
the
dmt
communication
if
you
will
or
lesson
that
i
construed
was
that
joy
and
infinite
astonishment
a
deep
and
fluid
indivisiveness
of
being
at
its
grandest
lays
beneath
all
moments
in
time

i
dont
fear
death
nor
speculate
what
may
come
after
it

perhaps
reincarnation
hell
or
nothing
at
all

whatever
it
may
be
it
seems
incapable
of
circumventing
the
juncture
dmt
brought
my
mind
to
a
palatial
crux
of
all
things
from
which
only
itself
can
arise

now
what
is
so
important




set
sitting
at
on
a
sofa
in
an
unfamiliar
flat
with
a
good
friend
and
a
new
acquaintance
being
filmed
this
time
we
experimented
with
3
times
as
much
as
i
had
in
first
experience
smoked
through
a
pipe
upping
the
dosage
may
have
been
a
little
arrogant
as
youll
soon
realise
it
did
ensure
for
myself
at
least
that
i
broke
through
or
more
aptly
just
broke

from
web-based
accounts
of
dmt
mckenna
acolytes
and
any
novice
psychonauts
worth
their
salt
want
to
talk
about
elves
the
self-replicating
machine
elves
that
is
we
should
avoid
this
semantic
quandary
bequeathed
to
us
by
mckenna
for
whilst
it
serves
its
purpose
he
would
be
the
last
person
to
want
us
to
try
and
interpret
our
subjective
experience
through
the
lenses
of
his
work
or
words


elves
they
could
well
be
children
playing
with
strange
devices
of
celestial
calibration
laughing
like
the
buddha
deeply
inhaling
the
heavy
smoke
i
laughed
out
loud
my
old
friends
were
back
this
time
more
vivid
incredibly
large
and
spinning
and
levitating
in
and
around
me
the
same
kaleidoscopic-geometric
forms
appeared
the
carnival
theme
carried
over
from
my
first
time
the
black
and
white
checkerboard
with
a
memorable
harlequin
design
motif


self-replicating
yes
or
embedded
in
the
very
fabric
of
the
universe
yet
eternally
creating
themselves
machine-like

yes
playful
in
robotic
way

but
nonetheless
sentient


then
the
wheels
fell
off


what
happened
next
could
well
have
been
the
classic
problem
of
set
and
setting
an
unfamiliar
house
in
an
unfamiliar
part
of
london
with
someone
id
just
met
filming
the
whole
process
very
probably
on
the
other
hand
the
next
terrifying
few
minutes
could
have
be
part
of
the
dancing
space
babies
initiation
fuck
knows


the
first
thing
i
remember
was
a
sound
followed
by
a
glance
down
at
my
torso
not
that
i
could
see
it
as
it
was
or
the
room
at
this
point
yet
my
eyes
remained
open
for
the
whole
show
unlike
the
first
time
round
a
terrifyingly
sensual
popping
melting
squelching
shitting/pissing
feeling
my
body
felt

bursting
with
completely
new
energies
mckenna
calls
this
breaking
the
membrane

id
say
its
akin
to
something
sucking
your
body
off
i
felt
like
a
naked
child
a
loss
of
cosmic
virginity
the
feeling
wasnt
off
being
violated
just
the
stultifying
shock
at
the
loss
of
my
internal
organs
torso
and
legs
and
perhaps
more
terrifying
still
the
loss
of
my
ego


the
elves
were
long
gone
when
the
police
arrived
and
an
ambulance
crew
a
film
crew
and
whole
host
of
people
had
gathered
from
across
the
city
to
witness
my
death
hes
taken
dmt
someone
commented
weve
seen
this
before
they
murmured
oh
no
there
goes
his
body
someone
said
except
no
one
actually
said
that
nor
did
i
actually
visualise
any
of
these
people
rather
it
was
more
like
my
subconscious
had
gone
nuclear
extrapolated
the
actual
albeit
unfamiliar
but
not
alien
setting
into
some
gigantic
act
of
hallucinary
ego-centrism


during
this
challenging
test
my
wingman
had
asked
me
one
question
and
im
not
sure
how
i
actually
heard
him

are
you
ok
mate

noi
answered
quickly
as
if
to
remind
me
my
body
was
very
much
alive
and
present
he
hugged
me
and
then
sat
beside
me
i
looked
at
his
face
the
only
thing
i
recognised
in
this
mad
panic-stricken
extraterrestrial
accident
scene
that
id
become
victim
of
trapped
inside
suddenly
he
became
the
chief
representative
of
the
assembled
host

ride
it
out
mate
youll
be
fine
his
face
now
red
and
black
polka-dotted
like
a
comical
friendly
demon
his
arm
which
i
was
touching
was
covered
thickly
in
off-white
yellow
tinged
hair
like
a
ferrets
this
was
immensely
comforting
for
some
reason
it
was
the
most
mammalian
aspect
of
what
was
otherwise
an
alien
nightmaretime
after
all
i
was
a
mammal
wasnt
i
what
did
i
have
in
common
with
the
spoiled
children
of
the
aeon
and
all
their
orb-swirling
exhalted
haughtiness


then
my
brain
finished
its
absorption
of
the
chemical
and
i
stood
exhaled
violently
and
attempted
to
fetch
a
cigarette
i
could
see
the
room
again
and
its
occupants
and
i
could
speak
my
vision
seemed
to
have
been
artificially
enhanced
as
if
someone
had
upgraded
my
eyes
whilst
my
body
had
been
dismantled
vibrant
brilliant
colours
streamed
out
of
the
most
mundane
of
objects
everything
had
a
vague
holographic
effect
around
it
the
walls
swayed
in
and
out
enlarging
themselves
i
was
convinced
all
the
furniture
had
been
rearranged
and
that
the
room
itself
was
twice
the
size
for
a
second
i
felt
as
if
i
was
going
to
be
permanently
left
with
this
gift
of
ultra-vivid
sight
as
if
my
eyes
were
able
to
bend
and
refract
light
at
will
this
gave
me
the
sense
that
everything
down
to
the
ash
in
the
ashtray
had
been
reformed
or
rebuilt
rapidly
by
crazed
psychedelic
nanobots
after
its
initial
destruction
they
rebuilt
it
along
the
same
lines
but
with
a
dose
of
cartoonish
and
video-game
technicolor
shininess
and
vividness
this
was
my
nu-world


i
held
out
my
packet
of
camels
which
appeared
comically
large
jumped
up
in
the
air
at
the
unrivalled
joy
of
remembering
where
i
was
who
i
was
and
what
had
just
happened

just
as
before
this
trip
was
so
unfathomably
removed
from
mundane
consciousness
that
words
wash
off
it
there
are
no
reference
points
perhaps
this
remains
dmt
biggest
disadavantage
with
lsd
and
ketamine
there
seems
to
be
a
clear
process
of
dismantling
and
rebuilding
ones
self-identity

and
of
interaction
with
our
own
minds
and
thought-patterns
this
can
of
course
be
incredibly
useful
for
personal
development
and
can
have
some
lasting
effect
in
reality
in
contrast
dmt
presented
entities
other
minds
and
intelligences
superior
to
my
own
yet
conscious
and
observing
my
thoughts
there
was
no
mental
breakdown
and
recovery
or
if
there
is
it
occurs
in
seconds
a
passive
relaxed
mind
allows
the
experience
to
wash
over
me
without
imposing
myself
on
it

since
it
is
so
unlike
normal
reality
it
was
and
still
is
difficult
for

me
to
bring
any
of
the
trip
back
to
daily
life


to
conclude
this
wasnt
quite
etheogenic
maturity

or
entry
into
the
club
which
boasts
the
heavens
and
cosmic
beings
as
its
members
that
is
yet
to
come

if
we
are
all
in
these
potentially
dangerous
and
damaging
psychedelic
pursuits
aspiring
shaman
then
i
believe
true
appreciation
or
even
some
notion
of
understanding
of
the
entheogens
must
come
over
time
and
with
some
form
of
training
dmt
offers
a
form
of
shortcut
that
might
not
be
for
everyone
as
my
first
near-death
experience
my
first
intense
flash
in
the
divine
pan
it
will
stay
with
me
for
the
rest
of
my
days

it
will
remain
a
significant
glimpse
into
what
the
rigveda
refers
to
as
that
deathless
undecaying
world
wherein
the
light
of
heaven
is
set
and
everlasting
lustre
shines
that
realm
where
happiness
and
transports
where
joy
and
felicities
combine




in
the
middle
of
the
woods
in
my
area
which
is
a
very
flat
area
compared
to
most
is
a
point
that
is
considered
the
highest
in
the
region
and
is
little
known
to
even
the
locals
in
the
area
it
was
previously
used
as
a
gravel
mine
but
had
long
since
been
abandoned
the
road
through
the
woods
suddenly
starts
gaining
altitude
until
the
clearing
and
slope
emerges
and
at
the
summit
several
trails
branch
out
from
the
flat
rocky
surface
on
top
only
to
be
lost
in
the
dense
pine
trees
the
spot
on
top
has
plenty
of
room
to
start
a
fire
a
safe
distance
from
the
truck
and
to
sit
around
it
on
sleeping
bags


this
was
our
setting
late
at
night
around
the
campfire
with
sound
tribe
sector
nine
playing
in
the
background
from
the
truck
radio
throughout
the
night
we
were
blazing
with
a
combination
of
weed
and
good
opium
to
chill
out
as
we
sit
next
to
the
campfire
on
the
summit
at
about
1030
pm
we
finally
feel
the
time
is
right
we
are
completely
calm
and
stoned
when
my
friend
pulls
out
his
bag
and
packs
a
bowl
of
about
05
grams
of
dmt
i
study
him
as
he
vaporizes
the
contents
and
pulls
through
a
single
puff
closes
his
eyes
and
lowers
his
head
i
watch
in
wonder
as
he
is
unmoving
but
slightly
amused
by
something
i
didnt
know
about

after
about
10
minutes
he
comes
down
and
tells
me
about
these
colorful
art
beings
he
saw
running
around
and
climbing
ladders
they
were
waist
high
and
single-colored
always
changing
shape
but
retaining
a
basic
form
his
experience
was
not
anywhere
near
as
powerful
as
mine
was
about
to
be

when
my
turn
came
i
was
full
of
anticipation
of
what
i
would
experience
i
filled
about
1
grams
of
dmt
into
the
bowl
and
lightly
treaded
so
that
it
wouldnt
be
wasted
if
the
flame
touched
it
directly
on
the
first
two
hits
the
dmt
melted
into
a
liquid
that
was
vaporized
on
the
third
hit
i
knew
i
had
gotten
a
huge
hit
so
i
held
it
in
for
as
long
as
i
could
and
released


i
closed
my
eyes
and
while
doing
so
experienced
a
rhythmic
warping
of
space
around
me
as
if
the
world
was
breathing
i
had
no
clue
that
it
was
truly
my
third
eye
slowly
opening
and
greeting
me
foreword
the
feeling
soon
left
and
i
was
facing
an
infinite
expanse
of
grid
work
that
must
have
been
the
boundary
of
my
dimension
as
i
knew
it
and
was
initially
flat
but
changed
into
semi-three
dimensional
unrecognizable
figures
however
one
emerged
that
particularly
caught
my
attention
in
front
of
me
formed
the
silhouette
of
the
upper
torso
and
head
of
some
kind
of
humanlike
but
nonhuman
being
that
was
the
same
flowing
texture
of
the
grid
work
i
had
previously
seen
he
was
welcoming
me
to
his
world
he
was
one
of
them

it
disappeared
but
suddenly
i
found
myself
behind
table
in
the
back
left
portion
of
a
great
room
with
chair
and
table
setups
like
a
coffee
shop
might
be
situated
to
the
left
of
me
was
an
infinitely
high
corridor
my
best
comparison
is
a
small
shop
off
an
airport
terminal
corridor
everything
in
this
dimension
was
defined
by
bright
white
light
like
the
essence
of
all
color
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
dimension
were
of
the
same
color
although
they
were
the
same
hue
as
their
dimension
they
had
clear
definition
they
were
of
the
same
species
as
the
creature
i
had
initially
met
but
this
time
i
was
seeing
them
in
their
own
world
i
would
like
to
have
known
my
form
while
in
their
dimension
i
was
somehow
different
just
like
the
being
had
been
different
in
my
dimension

very
tall
and
draped
in
white
silky
cloaks
that
meshed
with
their
colorless
faces
and
into
their
headwear
that
rose
like
top
hats
their
cloaks
ended
into
nothingness
which
is
also
what
they
floated
on
however
their
eyes
were
their
most
outstanding
feature
they
were
the
only
things
that
contrasted
with
the
colorless
surroundings
and
their
bodies
black
was
their
color
but
a
deep
black
that
showed
the
wisdom
of
eternity


the
beings
were
floating
through
the
eternally
high
corridor
and
between
crowded
tables
i
specifically
remember
one
of
them
traversing
to
the
right
of
me
heading
in
the
direction
i
was
facing
i
did
not
talk
to
them
and
they
did
not
talk
to
me
they
went
about
their
business
without
acknowledging
my
existence
i
was
not
frightened
by
them
but
instead
in
awe
to
the
point
that
i
was
speechless
sometimes
i
wonder
what
i
would
have
learned
from
them
had
i
attempted
to
communicate

after
a
few
seconds
i
left
the
godly
creatures
domain
was
moved
into
another
dimension
where
time
and
space
around
me
slowed
and
quickened
and
repeated
in
different
frames
i
could
not
keep
track
of
times
movements
no
matter
how
hard
i
tried
to
concentrate
on
even
one
part
in
the
middle
of
the
chaos
existed
a
symbolic
time
clock
with
as
many
hands
as
there
were
times
moving
which
recorded
the
changes
that
i
could
not
begin
to
comprehend
i
was
helpless
and
was
forced
to
experience
this
chaos
or
maybe
i
persisted
to
keep
track
and
was
overwhelmed
i
cant
tell
which

that
still
did
not
last
long
because
it
was
so
intense
that
a
strange
and
strong
voice
had
told
me
to
open
my
eyes
and
as
i
slowly
did
so
however
reluctantly
or
luckily
i
dont
know
which
horizontal
rainbow
trails
swept
throughout
the
terrain
i
was
finally
placed
back
on
the
hill
in
front
of
the
campfire
but
it
didnt
seem
like
the
same
place
i
had
left
instead
the
landscape
held
a
greenish
alien
hue
that
was
mikes
mountain
and
not
at
the
same
time

as
i
tried
to
turn
my
experience
to
words
with
my
friend
there
was
a
feeling
of
euphoria
that
rendered
me
almost
speechless
i
felt
reborn
and
renewed
my
life
had
restarted
i
felt
like
a
newborn
baby
seeing
the
light
for
the
first
time
its
eyes
squinting
and
unable
to
recognize
its
new
surroundings




this
experience
happened
nearly
a
year
ago
to
date
and
while
some
of
the
smaller
details
may
have
slipped
from
memory
i
believe
what
i
experienced
that
night
was
powerful
enough
that
i
can
still
describe
what
happened
to
me
with
the
detail
and
accuracy
that
i
feel
this
trip
report
deserves
however
given
the
time
that
has
passed
some
blanks
may
need
to
be
filled
in
and
i
will
do
this
the
best
i
can
while
i
was
on
methoxetamine
the
true
beauty
of
this
night
and
what
i
want
to
describe
to
you
in
more
detail
was
my
dmt
breakthrough
if
you
happen
to
read
this
trip
report
all
the
way
through
i
hope
i
can
successfully
convey
even
just
a
fraction
of
the
awe
and
feeling
that
i
felt
that
night

dmt
had
always
been
something
i
had
wanted
to
experience
and
i
had
read
about
it
for
years
before
actually
trying
it
on
one
occasion
prior
to
this
experience
i
actually
did
try
it
but
i
didnt
breakthrough
to
the
hyperspace
i
had
read
about
i
just
had
visuals
and
a
body
feeling
that
i
wouldnt
call
entirely
enjoyable
just
strange
yet
i
was
still
pretty
determined
to
get
to
that
place
and
see
what
the
hype
was
about
so
last
summer
i
bought
a
kilo
of
mimosa
root
bark
and
extracted
my
own
dmt
i
didnt
get
as
much
as
i
expected
but
it
was
still
at
least
a
couple
grams
of
white
fluffy
dmt
to
experiment
with
yet
as
excited
as
i
was
to
attempt
a
breakthrough
for
some
reason
i
was
just
too
scared
to
go
all
the
way
id
take
a
hit
and
get
that
strange
feeling
in
my
body
which
kind
of
intimidated
me
and
then
i
would
back
out
from
going
farther
doing
dmt
and
not
breaking
through
still
gives
me
open
eye
visuals
it
is
just
too
weird
of
feeling
for
me
to
enjoy
and
i
get
a
prickly
sensation
all
over
plus
the
taste
and
smell
of
burnt
plastic
is
just
off
putting

around
this
time
last
year
was
also
when
i
was
first
introduced
to
methoxetamine
while
i
wouldnt
call
myself
experienced
with
it
i
was
comfortable
using
it
and
had
been
in
what
some
might
described
as
an
\x93m-hole
from
the
couple
times
i
had
tried
it
before
i
found
it
took
about
100mg
to
get
me
fully
dissociated
and
in
to
a
hole
at
the
time
i
lived
in
a
bit
of
a
party
house
and
it
happened
to
be
a
work
night
so
it
was
actually
quiet
for
once
i
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
peace
and
calm
and
weighed
out
about
75mg
of
mxe
at
what
i
want
to
say
was
about
9
in
the
evening
and
then
insufflated
it


the
come
up
of
mxe
takes
forever
for
me
about
an
hour
to
really
start
getting
in
to
the
trip
and
about
two
hours
to
peak
and
from
there
im
really
messed
up
for
another
two
hours
or
so
and
then
begin
to
get
my
head
back
it
find
it
to
be
a
pretty
relaxing
substance
over
all
and
my
favorite
thing
to
do
on
it
is
simply
turn
on
some
tunes
and
just
lay
in
my
bed
in
the
dark
wrapped
in
blankets
and
let
the
chemical
overtake
me
i
proceeded
to
do
just
that
making
my
bed
comfy
and
i
then
turned
on
a
local
college
radio
station
that
plays
a
lot
of
mellow
tunes
from
just
about
any
genre
you
can
imagine
but
mostly
indy
and
local
stuff
ive
never
heard
before
i
find
that
station
meshes
well
with
the
mxe
experience
and
little
did
i
know
then
it
would
come
to
shape
the
most
memorable
moment
of
my
night

as
the
time
passed
i
began
to
drift
ever
farther
from
reality
when
i
closed
my
eyes
new
worlds
would
seem
to
appear
before
me
worlds
of
color
and
texture
even
though
im
laying
down
it
feels
as
if
im
spinning
head
over
heal
and
i
truly
begin
to
float
through
these
worlds
the
music
from
the
stereo
shaped
the
colors
and
would
shift
the
textures
in
these
worlds
while
i
was
very
intoxicated
i
could
still
open
my
eyes
and
recognize
where
i
was
and
was
capable
of
getting
up
and
moving
albeit
without
much
coordination
after
what
i
would
say
was
about
three
hours
the
trip
was
no
longer
getting
more
intense
but
it
was
still
going
strong
and
for
some
reason
the
dmt
that
was
stashed
in
my
cabinet
came
to
mind
i
thought
what
the
hell
why
not

the
methoxetamine
had
me
quite
intoxicated
and
the
thought
of
smoking
dmt
did
not
make
me
feel
intimidated
like
it
had
every
other
time
i
pretty
much
stumbled
across
the
room
and
proceed
to
weigh
out
what
i
believe
was
about
75mg
of
dmt
and
put
it
on
top
of
a
small
amount
of
weed
in
my
bowl
i
go
back
to
my
bed
put
the
covers
over
me
and
take
a
deep
breath
i
applied
the
flame
to
the
bowl
lightly
touching
the
dmt
with
the
lighter
and
inhale
a
huge
hit
of
the
rather
unpleasant
tasting
and
smelling
smoke


i
spend
all
day
mowing
for
my
job
and
suddenly
these
two
still
frames
of
my
boss
and
the
mower
i
use
at
work
flash
through
my
brain
like
moving
snapshots
while
i
didnt
have
time
to
think
about
it
then
i
now
think
it
was
my
brain
attempting
to
hold
on
to
some
form
of
the
reality
that
it
had
always
known
and
since
i
spent
most
of
my
day
on
a
mower
thats
what
came
to
mind
most
readily
after
this
the
world
went
blank
and
i
felt
an
energy
flowing
through
my
body
although
i
was
not
aware
of
my
body
i
could
still
feel
this
power
flowing
through
me
then
quite
suddenly
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
grid
enveloped
everything
around
me
while
the
background
was
still
black
the
lines
of
the
grid
were
coming
more
and
more
in
to
focus

as
all
this
was
happening
i
could
still
think
about
what
was
occurring
with
some
semblance
of
rational
thought
although
i
did
not
remember
taking
any
drug
and
was
both
unaware
and
unconcerned
of
my
body
despite
this
odd
pulsating
energy
vibrating
through
me
at
first
i
was
somewhat
panicked
i
thought
to
myself
boy
you
really
did
it
this
time
you
really
took
it
too
far
now
theres
no
going
back
now
as
these
thoughts
crossed
my
mind
the
grid
then
began
to
morph
and
change
patterns
and
shapes
started
to
come
from
it
but
they
were
not
clearly
defined
it
was
as
if
a
cloak
was
over
top
of
them
that
bent
the
light
around
their
true
shape
a
shape
would
emerge
then
it
felt
as
if
the
grid
would
make
a
ninety
degree
turn
in
front
of
me
and
new
shapes
would
emerge
i
was
entirely
powerless
to
interfere
with
what
was
happening
around
me
colors
began
to
emerge
in
the
shapes
and
i
explicitly
remember
pink
and
green
being
the
most
prominent
and
they
were
incredibly
vivid
i
can
still
remember
the
way
they
struck
me
now
but
could
never
describe
in
words
what
they
looked
like
besides
pink
and
green
and
were
shaped

then
this
feeling
came
over
me
a
feeling
that
what
i
was
seeing
was
an
ancient
place
while
visually
it
looked
sharp
and
futuristic
i
had
an
overwhelming
feeling
that
it
was
older
than
time
this
might
sound
odd
but
it
reminded
me
of
what
i
mentally
picture
as
a
1950s
soda
shop
but
much
more
mystic
and
magical
of
course
like
everything
is
outlined
in
chrome
and
it
is
all
flashy
and
new
looking
but
it
still
has
the
retro
feel
its
the
best
i
can
describe
it
but
the
ancient
feeling
of
where
i
was
at
sharply
contrasted
the
futuristic
visuals
that
were
occurring
i
was
still
stupefied
about
what
was
going
on
but
i
slowly
began
to
realize
that
what
was
happening
wasnt
a
bad
thing
in
fact
it
was
somewhat
pleasant
and
accepted
my
fate
that
this
was
reality
now
or
perhaps
how
it
had
always
been
for
all
i
knew
at
that
point
in
that
instant
of
acceptance
the
energy
that
was
going
through
my
body
snapped
and
cracked
and
the
pulse
in
my
body
became
a
steady
surge
it
was
as
if
i
was
finally
plugged
in
to
everything
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
it
this
is
what
every
human
in
history
has
strived
to
reach
this
place
here
is
the
point
of
existence
while
what
was
going
on
around
me
was
visually
crazy
and
it
was
mentally
confounding
i
accepted
it
and
i
felt
it
accept
me
back
something
just
felt
right
about
it
i
keep
calling
it
the
beautiful
chaos
and
thats
just
the
perfect
way
to
describe
it

then
i
found
that
something
quite
strange
began
to
occur
i
believe
even
for
the
dmt
hyperspace
that
was
expanding
within
my
mind
out
of
the
corners
of
this
alternate
universe
music
began
to
play
and
i
even
recognized
the
lyrics
\x93i
am
he
as
you
are
he
as
you
are
me
and
we
are
all
together
it
was
the
freaking
beatles
playing
the
song
i
am
the
walrus
and
out
of
all
the
places
for
this
to
be
playing
it
was
happening
here
i
couldnt
make
sense
of
it
and
i
actually
thought
to
myself
that
if
i
was
in
heaven
right
now
god
must
really
like
the
beatles
the
universe
was
still
very
much
alive
with
color
and
movement
even
more
than
it
was
before
but
despite
the
confusion
and
beautiful
chaos
that
was
happening
around
me
i
could
understand
every
single
word
that
was
in
that
song
and
i
knew
it
was
the
beatles
i
was
pretty
dumfounded
about
why
it
was
playing
and
im
not
sure
at
what
point
in
the
song
that
it
entered
my
consciousness
but
it
must
have
been
toward
the
end
at
one
point
it
does
a
sudden
twist
in
the
beat
and
as
this
was
happening
the
song
just
shattered
everything
that
was
before
me
there
was
no
longer
a
grid
it
was
as
if
someone
shattered
it
like
glass
and
shards
of
color
were
rippling
and
then
exploding
from
every
direction
then
from
all
this
beautiful
chaos
it
appeared
as
if
a
group
of
people
were
coming
from
it
though
i
could
only
get
a
brief
glimpse
of
their
outline

then
just
as
suddenly
as
it
happened
i
was
back
in
my
room
sitting
in
my
bed
against
the
wall
with
the
bowl
lying
beside
me
on
the
sheets
it
honestly
took
me
a
couple
minutes
to
get
my
bearings
back
okay
i
told
myself
you
are
in
your
room
which
is
in
the
city
i
live
in
back
on
planet
earth
i
was
still
tripping
very
hard
and
there
were
crazy
ripples
of
light
everywhere
and
a
lot
of
morphing
but
i
was
no
longer
in
hyperspace
i
was
back
in
my
room
then
i
heard
the
radio
on
which
was
responsible
for
the
beatles
just
blowing
my
mind
and
it
finally
made
sense
why
it
was
playing
as
soon
i
was
a
little
more
settled
i
grabbed
my
phone
and
called
my
best
friend
i
proceeded
to
tell
him
i
finally
broke
through
and
all
i
could
say
after
was
\x93holy
shit
what
the
fuck
oh
my
god
and
i
repeated
those
three
phrase
for
at
least
twenty
minutes
it
really
was
all
i
could
say
after
that
i
called
my
girlfriend
told
her
anyways
that
the
most
amazing
thing
ever
had
just
happened
and
it
was
incredible
i
was
just
absolutely
ecstatic
and
i
felt
recharged
like
i
was
truly
alive
for
the
first
time
in
years
it
was
unbelievable

i
believe
the
mxe
was
still
coursing
through
my
system
because
i
tripped
for
quite
a
while
longer
it
synergized
very
well
with
the
dmt
and
i
just
sat
on
the
couch
taking
deep
breaths
staring
at
the
ceiling
watching
the
fireworks
i
cant
say
how
much
of
an
impact
it
had
on
my
breakthrough
im
sure
it
had
some
but
i
feel
as
though
the
dmt
completely
overpowered
it
for
the
time
that
i
was
out
i
continued
to
just
feel
really
good
for
quite
a
while
but
eventually
i
fell
asleep
around
4
am
and
woke
up
bright
and
early
for
work
with
a
couple
things
on
my
mind
i
could
never
possibly
convey
to
co-workers
for
only
having
a
couple
hours
of
sleep
i
felt
pretty
good
if
not
a
bit
wobbly
still
from
the
mxe
and
all
i
could
think
about
for
the
next
few
days
was
what
in
the
hell
happened
to
me

the
experience
itself
was
one
of
the
most
powerful
experiences
of
my
life
and
no
other
psychedelic
has
even
touched
what
dmt
did
to
me
although
i
had
a
couple
grams
of
dmt
left
i
have
never
even
really
smoked
any
of
it
again
i
was
hesitant
to
breakthrough
to
begin
with
and
now
im
equally
hesitant
to
go
back
now
that
i
know
how
powerful
dmt
is
if
i
had
to
describe
it
id
compare
it
to
how
i
imagine
someone
might
describe
skydiving
it
is
just
getting
out
the
door
thats
scary
but
once
you
do
you
are
in
for
a
ride
regardless
its
something
ill
be
forever
grateful
to
have
experienced
but
im
satisfied
with
having
experienced
it
the
dmt
was
just
soooooo
powerful
to
go
back
so
soon
even
a
year
later
though
one
day
i
will
return
with
the
remaining
grams
i
have
introduced
several
friends
to
the
world
that
is
dmt
and
let
them
get
a
taste
of
what
it
means
to
really
live
something
i
think
everyone
should
try
at
least
to
know
it
is
there

and
besides
now
every
time
i
hear
i
am
the
walrus
i
am
instantly
filled
with
nostalgia
and
the
feelings
come
back
from
that
fateful
night




first
a
little
background
information
to
provide
some
context
for
the
trip

this
experience
was
going
to
be
the
second
dmt
experience
of
my
life
and
i
was
extremely
excited
for
it
feeling
a
definite
charge
through
my
body
as
i
picked
up
the
bowl
and
contemplated
the
hit
and
what
it
was
going
to
do
to
me

having
just
had
my
first
dmt
experience
24
hours
earlier
i
was
more
than
aware
of
the
incredible
rush
that
was
going
to
blast
me
immediately
after
the
hit
and
to
be
honest
i
was
a
little
intimidated
by
it

during
the
first
experience
i
blasted
through
the
veil
immediately
and
was
thrown
out
into
this
gigantic
open
space
where
i
was
shown
innumerable
images
and
events

the
emotions
i
was
experiencing
in
that
place
were
that
i
was
home
and
that
i
had
been
there
sooo
many
times
before

these
were
some
of
if
not
the
strongest
emotions
i
have
ever
felt
in
my
life
it
had
felt
like
an
incredible
revelation
was
thrown
in
my
face
and
yet
it
was
the
most
obvious
thing
ever
to
me
i
was
jubilant
and
you
can
easily
see
from
the
first
trip
why
i
would
be
so
excited
for
the
second

anyway
to
the
trip



640
pm

in
my
friends
lounging
room
with
all
lights
off
and
with
7-8
candles
burning

3
close
friends
are
present
and
my
mindset
all
day
has
been
gearing
towards
preparing
for
this
moment

my
previous
trip
left
me
with
an
incredible
sense
that
i
needed
to
trip
again
almost
as
if
i
was
being
called
back
into
the
dmt
lands
to
be
shown
more

the
dmt
is
packed
in
a
water
pipe
with
a
thin
layer
of
weed
above
and
below
it
for
a
buffer

after
taking
about
15
minutes
to
meditate
and
get
myself
centered
i
decide
it
is
go
time
empty
my
lungs
and
lean
forward
to
the
pipe

taking

one
gigantic
hit
is
the
style
i
have
adopted
for
smoking
dmt
and
as
i
released
the
smoke
and
leaned
back
into
the
couch
reality
melted
away

it
appeared
as
though
i
was
passing
backwards
through
a
portal
total
tunnel
vision

simultaneously
i
was
experiencing/hearing
the
loudest
most
electric
shredding
sound
that
i
have
ever
heard/experienced

it
must
have
been
the
fabrics

of
time
shredding
because
after
this
moment
i
was
no
longer
in
the
physical
realm

641-646

this
is
the
part
of
the
trip
that
i
have
the
most
trouble
recalling
and
it
was
no
doubt
the
most
intense
part
as
well

i
distinctly
remember
the
feeling
of
being
home
again
i
was
definitely
no
question
in
the
same
place
that
i
had
gone
to
on
my
first
trip
and
even
further
down
the
rabbit
hole
this
time

i
was
feeling
the
feeling
of
infinity
much
stronger
than
my
first
trip
and
it
seemed
like
i
belonged
in
this
realm
this
time
around

i
was
there
for
so
long
it
really
cannot
be
put
in
to
words

in
fact
my
entire
trip
consisted
of
two
distinctly
different
experiences
one
in
body
and
one
out
of
body
but
both
of
which
lasted
what
seemed
like
an
eternity

unfortunately
for
me
i
do
not
remember
much
about
what
i
saw
in
this
place
but
what
i
was
able
to
bring
back
with
me
was
that
i
remember
the
choice
i
was
given
when
i
left
that
place

i
distinctly
remember
having
the
choice
to
stay
in
this
amazing
place
for
another
eternity
or
i
could
return
to
my
body

in
fact
up
until
this
point
i
hadnt
even
considered
my
body
or
this
world
but
the
moment
i
had
the
thoughts
that
the
drug
would
surely
be
wearing
off
soon
and
id
be
returning
to
my
body
my
consciousness
snapped
back
into
our
physical
realm

646-647

now
this
is
where
the
trip
really
starts
getting
crazy

at
this
point
my
consciousness
is
back
in
the
room
i
had
started
in
with
my
3
friends
except
that
it
is
not
really
a
room
at
all

instead
i
notice
that
we
are
kind
of
floating
in
this
beautifully
golden
aqueous
space
similar
to
the
wavy
ps3
background
but
in
indescribable
depth
and
definitionand
i
immediately
understand
this
to
be
the
place
where
reality
is
constructed
from

i
try
to
sense
my
body
but
its
completely
impossible
and
i
feel
completely
separated
from
it
i
look
around
to
try
to
see
me
body
and
i
can
make
out
my
legs
but
they
are
what
seems
like
many
yards
down
and
to
the
right
of
me
meaning
the
point
of
observation
would
have
been
somewhere
above
my
left
shoulder
in
the
physical
world

i
look
to
my
friends
but
they
do
not
look
like
they
normally
would

i
can
see
who
they
are
perfectly
but
instead
of
bodies
they
are
so
abstract
that
i
dont
even
know
what
words
would
do
it
justice

my
friends
are
clearly
having
a
loud
conversation
with
each
other
except
that
the
words
make
absolutely
no
sense
to
me
and
they
sound
like
the
craziest
combination
of
hundreds
of
languages
they
are
radiating
this
aura
of
power
and
i
feel
as
though
i
am
in
the
presence
of
some
kind
of
council
except
that
they
are
not
there
to
judge
me
but
rather
to
offer
support
and
reassure
me


there
are
many
other
sounds
going
on
in
the
room
echos
sounding
off
in
all
sorts
of
different
pitches
everything
had
an
incredibly
alien
feel
to
it
i
distinctly
remember
being
there
and
listening
to
their
pure
gibberish
conversation
for
a
very
very
long
time
and
then
out
of
no
where
it
hit
me

the
mega
grand
daddy
dmt
revelation
literally
as
if
thunderstruck
i
am
blasted
with
this
overwhelming
emotion
that
we
meaning
myself
and
my
friends
in
the
room
are
projecting
the
reality
we
know
as
life
together

and
even
further
than
that
i
can
remember
feeling
the
other
guys
energy
within
me
and
i
was
overwhelmed
with
the
notion
that
we
were
really
all
one
entity
experiencing
whatever
we
want
to
in
the
physical
realm
like
constructing
a
play
for
ourselves
to
enjoy
or
to
learn
from

648-652


it
was
after
this
wave
of
emotion
hit
me
that
reality
began
to
melt
away
again
it
seemed
as
though
the
room
and
my
friends
physical
existences
would
not
be
there
when
i
stopped
paying
attention
to
them
but
then
as
soon
as
i
wanted
to
be
back
in
the
room
i
could
be
and
it
would
re-materialize
before
my
eyes

i
continued
to
toy
around
with
this
new
found
ability
until
i
was
abruptly
sucked
back
fully
into
the
physical
world

it
was
at
this
point
that
i
opened
my
eyes
and
took
my
first
look
around
the
actual
room
i
had
started
in
and
then
i
realized
what
was
coming
next
before
it
even
started

you
see
during
my
first
dmt
out
of
body
experience
after
my
consciousness
returned
to
my
body
i
went
through
a
spell
of
about
5
minutes
where
i
was
shaking
violently
and
consistently
but
all
the
while
i
felt
immensely
calm
and
even
pleasurable

as
i
predicted
this
happened
again
for
about
6
minutes
my
entire
body
vibrated
with
this
incredible
energy
force
that
i
have
never
felt
besides
when
re-entering
my
body
on
dmt

it
is
almost
like
pure
ecstasy
charging
through
my
body
as
my
soul
reinvigorates
my
flesh

after
the
6
minutes
i
settle
down
into
my
body
and
my
skin
starts
to
feel
like
it
glowing
with
heat
my
head
feels
super
charged

post-trip
rundown

immediately
following
the
trip
one
of
my
friends
had
a
notebook
and
pencil
handy
and
decided
to
start
jotting
down
everything
i
was
rambling
on
about

this
turned
out
to
be
an
incredible
tool
when
i
wanted
to
go
back
later
and
remember
certain
aspects
of
the
trip
because
there
are
certain
key
words
or
emotions
in
the
notes
that
will
trigger
entire
memories
from
the
trip

it
also
helped
a
great
deal
in
making
this
journal

really
the
main
thing
i
want
to
discuss
from
this
post-trip
conversation
i
had
with
my
friends
is
this

as
i
was
explaining
to
them
that
i
had
sat
and
watched
them
carry
out
an
alien
conversation
of
gibberish
for
was
seemed
like
hours
they
told
me
that
i
had
in
fact
not
opened
my
eyes
to
watch
them
at
all
during
my
trip
and
that
they
had
hardly
uttered
more
than
a
few
words
to
each
other
and
when
they
did
they
whispered
quietly
to
not
disturb
me

this
revelation
absolutely
blew
me
out
of
the
water
did
this
mean
i
was
really
watching
them
all
the
entire
time
through
my
third
eye
instead
of
my
physical
eyes
wow


morning
after

this
is
what
i
remember
most
from
this
entire
revelation
ordeal

i
cannot
remember
exactly
what
the
revelations
that
i
learned
in
that
place
where
but
i
do
remember
asking
myself
during
the
comedown
will
they
allow
me
to
share
the
information
i
just
received
or
should
i
keep
it
to
myself
this
is
a
very
strange
thought
and
yet
i
remember
it
as
being
exactly
as
i
worded
it
here
this
tells
me
that
a
clearly
i
felt
the
information
was
almost
so
sacred
that
people
should
discover
it
for
themselves

b
clearly
i
felt
there
were
other
forces
that
revealed
this
information
to
me
and
i
was
questioning
whether
or
not
they
would
want
me
sharing
it
i
was
very
shaken
by
these
revelations
when
i
was
in
the
moment
and
not
in
the
sense
that
i
was
concerned
for
my
well
being
or
anything
but
rather
just
completely
and
utterly
blown
away
by
it
i
was
also
very
shaken
and
a
little
scared
when
offered
the
opportunity
to
leave
this
reality
for
eternity
no
doubt
that
is
why
i
am
back
here
now

however
i
was
also
laughing
like
a
madman
on
the
inside
knowing
what
i
had
discovered

its
important
to
remember
that
regardless
of
what
i
say
now
to
try
to
rationalize/put
the
trip
into
terms
we
can
understand
through
this
realm
i
was
literally
the
happiest
i
have
ever
been
in
my
life
while
realizing
whatever
i
realized
in
that
trip

i
also
got
the
sense
deep
down
inside
that
i
wasnt
fully
ready
to
abandon
our
reality
just
yet
so
maybe
that
indicates
that
subconsciously
i
knew
i
had
more
to
do
on
this
planet
yet
but
really
who
knows


another
thing
that
is
interesting
to
note

the
night
after
this
experience
i
woke
up
about
5-6
times
into
sort
of
a
half
awake/half
sleeping
state

while
in
that
state
i
could
remember
my
dreams
vividly
and
i
was
moaning
while
laying
in
bed
in
something
like
ecstasy

now
i
can
only
vaguely
remember
the
dreams
but
ive
never
experienced
anything
like
that
before
and
am
convinced
my
pineal/the
dmt
had
something
or
a
lot
to
do
with
it
anyway
after
an
experience
like
this
i
have
only
the
highest
of
hopes
in
regards
to
what
dmt
can
show
me
about
myself
and
the
nature
of
existence
still
longing
very
strongly
to
try
ayahuasca/changa
to
get
a
more
lengthy
experience
although
there
is
no
escape
once
in
the
heat
of
a
trip
like
that
i
hope
this
report
helps
someone
make
sense
of
something
theyve
experienced
that
is
as
incredible
as
my
experience
was

happy
tripping





hello
everyone

i
remember
almost
two
years
ago
reading
how
the
substance
dmt
affects
our
brains
bodies
spirits
or
whatever
else
on
this
site
and
many
other
different
sites
as
well
dmt
hyperspace
something
i
never
would
of
ever
imagined
to
be
an
actuality
to
be
an
actual
reality
that
may
very
well
be
real
i
remember
laughing
at
a
sites
faq
explaining
the
possibilities
on
how
and
what
dmt
does
and/or
is
i
was
sixteen
years
old
then
and
since
then
i
have
experienced
with
psilocybin
mushrooms
and
lsd
a
great
number
of
times
and
they
were
and
still
are
some
of
the
most
amazing
and
most
beautiful
experiences
i
have
ever
had
in
my
entire
life
sometimes
the
most
terrifying
as
well
it
wasnt
in
til
recently
that
i
have
obtained
a
large
amount
of
dmt
i
was
very
much
excited
i
had
very
high
expectations
and
have
been
waiting
for
more
than
two
years
to
finally
break
through
dmt
hyperspace

here
is
my
story

in
the
recent
past
and
current
present
i
have
been
experimenting
with
large
doses
of
dmt
i
started
off
with
lower
doses
at
first
getting
a
mild
dmt
body
high
and
visuals
similar
to
the
peak
of
an
lsd
or
psilocybin
mushrooms
trip
only
lasting
around
5
to
10
minutes
which
sounds
about
right
i
was
getting
to
these
levels
at
first
with
a
group
of
friends
as
so
were
they
but
none
of
us
ever
came
close
to
breaking
into
a
hyperspace
i
started
to
have
my
doubts
but
knew
that
there
was
still
more
to
the
substance
i
perhaps
just
hadnt
perfected
the
technique
in
smoking
it
out
of
an
oil
burner
or
glass
vaporizer
it
wasnt
in
till
recently
when
i
finally
perfected
the
process
in
vaporizing
and
smoking
the
substance
and
reaching
a
hyperspace
of
some
sort
colors
would
randomly
appear
in
front
of
me
merging
within
everything
become
one
it
was
an
amazing
thing
an
amazing
feeling
an
amazing
experience
like
no
other
i
thought
to
myself
i
was
getting
to
this
place
assuming
that
this
place
was
the
highest
level
of
dmt
and
assuming
this
was
the
hyperspace
everyone
was
talking
about
however
i
was
wrong

the
first
time
it
happened
i
was
in
my
apartment
by
my
self
away
from
friends
family
all
of
that
i
did
it
sitting
in
a
pretty
comfortable
game
chair
i
got
for
christmas
one
year
which
was
set
up
in
my
room
i
was
able
to
get
around
three
very
long
big
hits
when
it
happened
it
wasnt
really
like
being
shot
out
of
a
cannon
into
hyperspace
or
anything
like
that
but
something
different
it
was
more
well
it
was
in
fact
a
teleportation
i
was
teleported
into
an
alien
spaceship
compartment
flying
through
space
i
dont
mean
like
it
was
kind
of
like
an
alien
spaceship
or
i
thought
it
was
an
alien
spaceship
no
it
was
an
alien
spaceship
there
were
not
colors
everywhere
or
it
wasnt
like
a
travel
through
hyperspace
or
anything
that
had
happened
to
me
in
the
past
this
was
so
real
so
detail
it
was
so
detail
in
every
way
it
was
like
i
was
really
there
in
a
spaceship
it
was
reality
i
wasnt
dreaming
tripping
anything
like
that
i
was
actually
there

the
entire
time
i
sat
there
not
being
able
to
move
but
just
gaze
in
amazement
i
felt
a
presence
i
felt
an
alien
presence
above
me
like
they
were
watching
me
observing
me
like
they
were
talking
to
me
telepathically
communicating
with
me
through
thought
trying
to
show
me
things
or
perhaps
they
were
trying
to
experiment
with
me
i
was
so
afraid
confused
yet
amazed
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
like
i
was
there
for
almost
an
hour
and
maybe
i
was
my
perception
of
time
was
out
of
the
window
my
mind
was
in
shock
the
last
thing
i
remember
while
being
in
that
spaceship
is
a
strong
telepathic
signal
from
one
of
the
aliens
that
triggered
something
inside
me
i
was
able
to
look
down
at
my
legs
my
arms
and
see
my
bones
twisting
and
turning
my
hair
building
thicker
and
thicker
i
was
turning
into
a
monkey

it
was
so
real
i
just
cant
stress
that
enough
i
was
totally
freaking
out
when
everything
suddenly
teleported
back
to
my
room
back
to
my
reality
however
though
the
hyperspace
though
the
aliens
had
left
i
was
tripping
hard
everything
around
my
was
twisting
and
turning
my
bones
would
still
twist
and
turn
if
i
looked
at
them
long
enough
when
i
looked
in
the
mirror
i
looked
like
i
was
an
alien
everything
was
just
off
and
it
was
so
intense
that
lasted
for
at
least
30
minutes
or
so
which
eventually
faded
as
i
laid
in
my
bed
not
being
able
to
stop
thinking
not
being
able
to
sleep
my
entire
body
mind
and
spirit
was
in
awe


the
next
day
i
told
my
room
mate
everything
that
happened
and
he
like
myself
were
always
fascinated
by
dmt
and
always
joked
about
alien
lifeforms
and
conspiracy
theories
and
junk
however
he
was
very
afraid
of
actually
going
to
the
places
that
was
described
as
the
dmt
hyperspace
and
as
much
as
he
enjoyed
reading
and
understanding
the
drug
he
would
not
do
it
he
wasnt
ready
after
a
long
discussion
on
what
i
had
experienced
i
was
actually
convinced
that
i
was
contacted
with
a
very
intelligent
alien
life
form
through
dmt
i
had
this
crazy
theory
like
the
aliens
knew
i
had
dmt
and
were
trying
to
contact
me
show
me
things
while
i
could
see
them
when
my
third
eye
was
activated
crazy
right
anyways
my
friend
said
i
should
try
it
again
tonight
and
see
if
i
have
a
similar
experience
i
concluded
that
i
would
in
fact
try
it
once
again
later
that
night

i
did
it
in
the
same
place
around
the
same
time
with
the
same
dose


beyond
hyperspace
time
and
life

everything
around
me
instantly
began
to
change
it
was
so
alien
so
unbelievable
i
could
see
energy
coming
up
my
body
telepathically
communications
all
through
in
and
throughout
my
body
energy
shifting
around
me
life
as
i
know
it
showing
me
that
there
is
so
much
more
than
the
simple
physical
realm
of
fantasy
i
live
in
i
was
being
told
instantly
that
aliens
were
in
fact
very
real
and
i
knew
they
were
now
i
knew
that
if
this
is
happening
right
now
right
here
then
there
is
no
way
they
are
not
real
it
was
so
unexplainable
so
intense
so
real
it
was
nothing
i
have
ever
heard
throughout
readings
on
internet
or
books
about
the
drug
i
was
out
of
control
life
was
out
of
control
i
was
in
the
middle
of
another
transportation
except
it
was
so
much
more
intense
right
before
my
eyes
i
left
the
physical
realm
i
was
able
to
look
down
and
see
once
again
my
bones
twisting
and
turning
everywhere
my
hair
growing
i
look
up
to
scream
but
it
was
too
late
my
head
is
thrown
back
as
my
spirit
or
brain
is
transformed
into
pure
energy
i
am
now
flowing
through
a
network
of
systems
and
i
am
one
with
the
aliens
i
am
what
they
are
i
am
super
intelligent
i
know
all
the
secrets
of
the
world
bam
just
like
that
constant
super
intelligent
information
is
transmitted
into
my
brain
by
the
aliens
who
are
energy
like
me
it
all
comes
to
me

the
ultimate
understanding
rhythms
of
the
human
conspiracy
about
lifes
deepest
concepts
can
be
broken
into
by
the
journey
to
a
intergalactic
hyperspace
of
universes
enduring
into
these
worlds
will
produce
realities
of
self-inflicted
fantasies
however
they
are
real
your
body
is
at
place
while
your
spirit
is
trying
to
leave
and
show
you
extraordinary
things
your
mind
will
learn
what
your
spirit
has
learned
and
in
the
end
your
ultimate
individuality
will
grow
as
a
force
here
on
the
planet
earth
noisy
sensations
of
parallel
feelings
towards
distinction
triumph
and
immortality
like
realities
slam
our
brains
from
every
single
most
exact
dimensional
layers
according
to
the
most
advanced
properties
of
physics

they
are
playing
with
me
laughing
at
me
showing
me
their
world
explaining
the
many
secrets
of
alien
life
and
the
many
secrets
of
the
physical
realm
i
had
been
living
on
i
knew
everything
i
knew
that
i
knew
it
was
right
i
still
think
it
might
be
right
i
am
one
with
everyone
i
am
the
universe
i
can
produce
a
million
words
into
actuality
at
once
and
so
can
they
it
was
the
most
beautiful
world
of
colors
and
life
fairies
and
aliens
ghost
and
angels
it
was
everything
it
was
the
spiritual
realm
of
existence
and
they
loved
me
so
much
they
told
me
so
much
and
they
told
me
that
i
could
come
back
whenever
i
wanted
and
to
bring
as
many
friends
as
possible
because
they
will
show
them
everything
too

when
i
started
to
finally
come
back
to
reality
i
wasnt
afraid
about
anything
anymore
i
didnt
question
life
anymore
and
this
is
because
i
actually
believed
that
i
was
just
taught
all
of
the
secrets
of
the
world
right
before
i
left
the
spiritual
world
i
was
enhanced
with
a
super
charge
of
energy
allowing
me
to
have
the
most
intense
mind
expansion
anyone
had
ever
imagined
i
could
create
and
do
anything
in
my
mind
and
see
it
like
it
was
happening
i
had
a
rush
of
euphoric
more
intense
than
the
greatest
lsd
and
mushroom
euphoria
put
together
by
a
million
i
still
was
in
touch
with
aliens
but
i
could
not
see
them
not
physically
that
is
this
feeling
lasted
for
at
the
least
of
an
additional
40
to
50
minutes
after
the
heaven
i
had
just
left
i
smiled
looking
down
at
a
text
from
my
roommate
who
had
been
staying
at
his
girlfriends
that
week
well
what
happened
man
how
did
it
go
did
you
see
aliens
again

i
didnt
even
respond
i
didnt
have
too
because
i
knew
that
the
physical
realm
was
nothing
more
than
a
illusion
i
knew
that
the
spiritual
realm
the
infinite
realm
was
and
would
always
be
the
more
beautiful
and
more
intelligent
realm
i
knew
this
because
the
aliens
knew
this
i
was
filled
with
the
greatest
feeling
i
have
ever
felt
it
was
the
greatest
experience
i
had
ever
experienced
it
was
better
than
anything
real
better
than
anything
here
i
then
knew
to
myself
that
i
had
become
addicted
physically
no
but
my
mental
mysticism
and
desire
was
so
intensely
obsessed
about
what
was
going
on


for
the
remainder
of
the
night
i
listened
to
some
trance
techno
for
a
few
hours
and
then
i
fell
asleep
like
a
baby
and
remember
having
some
very
intense
dreams
with
memories
of
seeing
the
aliens
while
i
was
asleep
when
i
awoke
my
roommate
had
came
back
and
was
so
curious
so
concerned
about
what
had
happened
i
remember
his
exact
words
dude
what
the
hell
happened
last
night
man
look
at
his
crazy
text
you
sent
me
i
looked
at
his
phone
and
smiled
even
though
i
should
of
been
freaked
out
it
was
a
text
from
me
that
said


we
have
shown
your
friend
everything
he
needs
to
know
we
want
you
too

i
didnt
remember
texting
that
at
all
my
friend
was
starting
to
worry
and
kind
of
freak
out
what
is
going
on
man
is
this
really
happening
are
these
things
really
happening
to
you
or
are
you
messing
with
me
i
looked
down
now
confused
again
is
this
real
do
i
even
know
what
real
is
anymore
what
is
happening
to
me
i
think
i
am
either
actually
discovering
the
secrets
of
the
world
or
slowly
slipping
into
insanity
oh
my
that
night
i
sat
there
looking
at
it
looking
at
the
dmt
loaded
in
the
pipe
ready
to
go
what
should
i
do
i
thought
i
have
to
get
back
to
where
i
was
they
told
me
i
could
go
back
whenever
i
wanted
it
was
decided


i
did
it
in
the
same
place
around
the
same
time
with
the
same
dose

energy
began
to
flow
like
before
alien
telepathic
communications
were
strong
i
began
to
look
up
and
close
my
eyes
only
to
be
shot
back
into
that
mystical
alien
spaceship
i
was
in
before
the
hyperspace
heaven
i
was
on
one
of
those
machines
that
carry
stuff
in
like
a
factory
being
rolled
through
some
kind
of
processor
data
analyzer
machine
seeing
the
aliens
all
around
me
looking
down
at
me
angry
they
were
so
intimidating
angry
upset
mad
at
me
but
i
didnt
know
why
i
wasnt
in
the
beautiful
place
they
had
taken
me
before
but
i
was
in
a
more
physical
realm
but
different
dimension
they
were
just
looking
at
me
sucking
all
of
the
intelligence
out
of
me
that
they
had
given
me
before
angry
at
me
for
some
reason
i
didnt
know
why
i
didnt
know
what
i
did
i
didnt
understand
i
was
shot
out
the
spaceship
quicker
than
normal
and
back
kind
of
sort
of
to
my
reality
except
my
body
was
once
again
changing
as
i
looked
at
it
my
hands
were
complete
monkey
along
with
big
hairy
arms
i
felt
like
i
was
actually
a
monkey
and
i
thought
i
had
began
to
scream
like
a
monkey
ooh
ooh
ee
ee
ah
ah
i
felt
lost
i
felt
like
part
of
my
brain
was
crazy
and
i
was
no
longer
super
intelligent
and
there
was
also
no
more
strong
intense
euphoria
like
before
what
had
happened
why
no

conclusion
and
final
thoughts

after
i
was
completely
down
i
began
to
really
rethink
reality
and
what
has
happened
to
me
in
the
last
week
perhaps
it
was
time
for
me
to
leave
the
substance
alone
for
a
while
i
need
a
week
or
so
to
settle
down
think
about
what
has
happened
try
and
figure
out
what
was
going
on
i
needed
help
i
thought
not
from
a
doctor
i
wasnt
completely
crazy
yet
i
am
still
in
touch
with
my
own
reality
but
i
am
very
well
beginning
to
question
reality
like
no
other
time
in
my
life
i
feel
as
though
that
i
have
broken
through
to
another
level
of
dmt
that
i
have
went
to
a
level
pass
dmt
made
contact
with
the
other
side
like
they
had
connected
to
me
the
things
that
had
been
happening
to
me
were
nothing
like
a
drug
nothing
like
lsd
or
anything
like
it
could
ever
do
what
this
has
done
not
even
close
this
substance
was
something
else
a
key
a
key
to
our
chemical
structure
a
key
to
our
dna
the
key
to
life
i
thought
that
i
had
been
living
in
a
science-fiction
horror
movie
and
that
i
was
quite
possibly
on
the
edge
of
going
insane
i
just
dont
know
what
to
think
about
all
of
this




having
a
fair
bit
of
experience
with
lsd
and
dmt
i
wanted
to
try
something
new
for
new
years
eve
my
friend
and
i
each
took
500mg
of
mescaline
hcl
which
we
put
into
gelatin
capsules
having
read
that
mescaline
causes
nausea
i
took
it
with
30ml
of
pepto
bismol
he
took
15ml
at
first
we
were
accompanied
by
another
friend
who
took
2
tabs
of
lsd
rated
at
100ug
each
my
friend
and
i
are
relatively
small
people
about
120lbs
and
55
i
am
on
10mg
of
escitalopram
he
isnt
on
any
medication
the
friend
who
took
the
two
tabs
is
on
20mg
of
citalopram

effects
are
noticed
within
the
first
30
minutes
it
hits
about
10
minutes
before
my
friend
who
took
acid
felt
anything
as
the
effects
build
so
does
the
nausea
it
is
quite
bearable
mostly
an
upset
stomach
and
general
discomfort
i
note
that
the
mescaline
is
very
different
from
acid
in
terms
of
how
it
hits
it
is
constant
and
gradual
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
peaks
or
high
points
like
my
friend
on
two
tabs
is
experiencing
hes
cranked
up
and
energetic
while
my
friend
and
i
feel
incredibly
peaceful

i
note
that
the
mescaline
is
very
different
from
acid
in
terms
of

hits
it
is
constant
and

experiencing
hes
cranked
up
and
energetic
while
my
friend
and
i
feel
incredibly
peaceful

the
visuals
are
fairly
strong
as
far
the
visuals
ive
experienced
on
acid
were
like
christmas
lights
outside
seem
brighter
everything
is
breathing/warping
and
when
i
look
at
my
carpet
with
flower
patterns
on
it
it
appears
as
though
the
flowers
are
swaying
within
the
wind

the
effects
continuously
build
in
intensity
about
two
hours
in
my
nausea
is
gone
my
friend
still
feels
ill
and
takes
another
15ml
of
pepto
bismol
within
30
minutes
hes
totally
fine
if
i
were
to
do
this
again
i
think
going
above
the
recommended
30ml
to
something
like
45ml
would
have
been
more
effective
neither
of
us
felt
all
that
uncomfortable
though
and
neither
of
us
felt
the
need
to
vomit
so
i
suppose
that
was
a
happy
success

it
is
interesting
to
note
that
relative
to
lsd
mescaline
does
not
seem
to
affect
ones
cognitive
abilities
nearly
as
much
a
little
focus
is
all
that
i
required
to
have
a
regular
conversation
and
appear
normal
i
didnt
necessarily
have
the
desire
to
do
so
as
it
is
much
more
enjoyable
to
be
silent
and
take
things
in
but
purchasing
cigarettes
was
a
far
simpler
matter
on
mescaline
than
when
peaking
on
lsd

at
about
the
3
hour
mark
my
friend
on
mescaline
smokes
some
marijuana
i
smoke
a
moderate
amount
of
5fur144
a
synthetic
cannabinoid
that
acts
like
marijuana
at
low
doses
and
more
like
acid
at
high
doses
synesthesia
mild
hallucinations
we
both
begin
to
see
tracers
the
effect
is
quite
like
looking
at
stereoscopic
3d
image
that
requires
red
and
blue
glasses
to
see
outlines
around
everything
are
obscured
by
multicolored
tracers

this
effects
subside
after
30
minutes
or
so
and
we
are
back
to
the
standard
effects
of
the
mescaline
a
wonderful
sense
of
calm
enhanced
colors
warping
of
patterns
and
breathing
our
friend
on
acid
eventually
leaves
and
we
are
about
4
hours
into
the
mescaline
its
feeling
as
though
it
is
more
or
less
leveling
off
so
we
decide
to
turn
things
up
we
each
take
one
tab
of
lsd
rated
at
100ug
each

we
feel
the
acid
quickly
the
calmness
of
the
mescaline
is
being
overridden
by
the
speedy
edginess
of
acid
our
visuals
start
getting
much
stronger
color
intensity
is
3
times
that
of
the
mescaline
alone
mild
lsd-like
fractals
appear
in
patterns
on
the
ceiling
but
to
a
fairly
minor
extent
when
the
heating
system
within
the
house
turns
on
i
hear
fast
and
beautiful
guitar
solos
within
my
head
my
friend
of
course
does
not
hear
them
it
is
merely
my
mind
re-interpreting
generic
whirr
of
the
rushing
air
as
something
very
beautiful
the
music
sounds
like
nothing
ive
ever
heard
before
its
very
fast
and
intricate
id
never
be
able
to
replicate
it
on
paper
or
hum
it
as
it
is
going
so
quickly
and
i
dont
have
the
necessary
musical
talent
to
transcribe
it

about
an
hour
or
so
into
the
acid
or
so
i
believe
we
havent
been
paying
as
much
time
to
the
clocks
aside
from
whether
or
not
the
new
year
has
arrived
we
freebase
about
50
mnother
50
mg
out
of
the
machine
which
is
effectively
a
glorified
crack
pipe
with
some
steel
wool
it
did
not
hit
anything
like
dmt
typically
does
the
changeg
between
the
two
of
us
off
of
tinfoil
and
then
a
in
visuals
were
very
very
minimal
however
the
change
in
our
headspace
was
drastic
the
edginess
of
the
acid
was
totally
removed
to
be
replaced
with
the
sort
of
single
mindedness
that
dmt
provides
the
calm
from
the
mescaline
was
back
stronger
than
it
was
before
the
next
40
minutes
or
so
feel
like
a
prolonged
dmt
trip
with
the
mescaline/lsd
hybridized
visuals
this
is
very
enjoyable
and
seems
to
redirect
the
trip
from
a
general
craziness
into
a
focused
and
calm
direction
of
external
information
its
hard
to
put
into
words

as
the
effects
of
the
dmt
seem
to
subside
i
elect
to
smoke
a
rather
substantial
portion
of
5fur144
and
my
friend
smokes
the
last
of
his
marijuana
he
also
takes
a
very
small
amount
of
5fur144

at
this
point
things
get
crazy

my
visuals
immediately
go
into
hyperdrive
the
tracers
come
back
7
or
8
times
stronger
the
edges
around
my
friend
are
warping
along
the
edges
of
his
face
flowing
along
his
bone
and
muscle
structure
the
traces
are
constantly
changing
color
and
consist
of
3-4
layers
in
constant
movement
that
look
much
like
something
from
apocolypto
or
maori
tattoos
his
hair
is
warping
and
twisting
he
looks
very
intense
with
this
sort
of
psychedelic
warpaint
superimposed
over
him

looking
around
the
room
things
seem
to
be
resembling
mayan
or
incan
art
i
am
not
a
religious
person
i
used
to
be
a
hard-line
atheist
and
prior
to
this
experience
i
would
describe
myself
as
agnostic
-
open
to
the
idea
of
a
higher
power
but
absolutely
opposed
to
any
organized
religious
interpretation
of
what
that
power
is
ive
always
viewed
chemicals
as
chemicals
mescaline
was
just
another
drug
at
this
point
the
imagery
im
seeing
my
carpet
get
warped
into
is
so
strikingly
similar
to
ancient
runes
and
designs
from
that
region
of
the
world
i
begin
to
have
my
doubts
my
friend
looks
like
some
sort
of
ancient
warrior
and
the
plant
behind
him
is
warping
into
amazing
designs
that
at
the
time
seemed
to
be
very
mathematically
designed

we
put
on
some
white
noise
in
the
background
we
both
stop
talking
for
the
majority
of
the
next
3
hours
we
both
are
overwhelmed
by
sensory
input
and
experience
an
amazing
euphoria

i
hear
constant
piano
solos
and
other
forms
of
incredibly
intricate
music
within
my
mind
the
synesthesia
i
experience
is
beautiful
i
look
at
something
with
lots
of
color
and
hear
more
noise
i
look
at
something
simple
and
the
noise
is
greatly
reduced
everything
i
look
at
has
this
amazing
beautiful
simplicity
to
it
my
friend
and
i
feel
that
the
room
we
are
in
is
perfect
in
every
single
way
as
i
look
to
my
ceiling
i
see
incredibly
intricate
fractals
being
formed
out
of
the
material
of
the
ceiling

i
look
at
something
simple
and
the
noise
is
greatly
reduced
everything
i
look
at
has
this
amazing
beautiful
simplicity
to
it
my
friend
and
i
feel
that
the
room
we
are
in
is
perfect
in
every
single
way
as
i
look
to
my
ceiling
i
see
incredibly
intricate
fractals
being
formed
out
of
the
material
of
the
ceiling



they
are
constantly
changing
and
wonderfully
complex
they
tessellate
with
one
another
and
are
beyond
virtually
anything
i
have
ever
seen
online
i
am
able
to
control
them
with
my
mind
and
can
have
them
form
anything
i
imagine
within
my
minds
eye
over
the
course
of
the
three
hours
i
find
myself
contemplating
things
about
life
humanity
god
and
the
universe
i
feel
as
though
im
lost
within
the
imagination
of
my
childhood
and
before
me
my
every
thought
is
animated
on
the
ceiling

the
most
profound
portion
of
this
experience
was
when
my
friend
and
i
were
looking
at
my
bookshelf
we
were
so
overwhelmed
by
this
incredible
sense
of
calm
wisdom
and
knowledge
it
was
strange
without
even
opening
the
books
we
felt
better
smarter
a
sense
of
acceptance
and
peace
that
i
have
never
felt
close
to
in
my
life
it
was
incredibly
fulfilling
and
spiritual
i
felt
amazing
it
simply
cannot
be
put
into
words
i
recall
thinking
to
myself
this
is
why
we
have
artists
to
put
feelings
and
emotions
into
forms
that
cannot
be
expressed
by
words
i
am
still
able
to
recall
that
calm
it
is
the
closest
i
have
ever
had
to
a
religious
experience

it
is
the
closest
i
have
ever
had
to
a
religious
experience

in
that
moment
i
said
to
my
friend
if
acid
makes
me
feel
beyond
a
doubt
there
is
no
god
mescaline
makes
me
think
that
if
he
does
exist
he
sure
loves
math
and
fractals

after
the
three
hours
things
went
back
to
the
standard
mescaline
visuals
of
warping
and
mild
color
intensity
we
smoke
5fur144
a
few
more
times
and
get
similar
though
lesser
in
intensity
experiences

i
can
honestly
say
this
was
one
of
the
best
experiences
of
my
life
i
have
never
expected
this
from
any
sort
of
drug
all
in
all
things
lasted
about
10
hours
i
took
a
codeine/acetaminophen
tablet
before
heading
to
bed
and
was
able
to
fall
asleep
within
1-2
hours
my
friend
did
not
take
one
and
was
up
for
the
rest
of
the
night
about
7
hours




as
a
casual
tripper
mushrooms
and
phenethylamines
were
definitely
otherworldly
and
revealing
of
my
soul
but
i
never
knew
such
a
thing
as
this
would
ever
be
possible
i
am
talking
about
my
introduction
to
nn-dimethyltryptamine
or
dmt
my
one
and
only

for
my
experience
i
was
at
a
friends
house
dimly
lit
by
small
windows
above
my
head
and
out
of
site
the
only
light
was
from
the
fading
evening
and
the
sparkle
of
objects
around
me
i
turn
on
eyes
of
the
world
by
the
grateful
dead
a
16
minute
long
version
with
saxophone
and
extended
jam
i
am
seated
on
a
comfortable
couch
and
had
been
smoking
a
lot
of
cannabis
in
the
form
of
blunts
and
also
in
bowls
for
hours
leading
up
to
the
experience
i
was
actually
feeling
only
slightly
burnt
out
coming
down
and
quite
sober
for
a
long-term
marijuana
smoker

my
friend
henry
walks
over
and
hands
me
a
crack
pipe
a
glass
tube
with
brillo/foil
on
the
end
loaded
with
what
he
called
a
big
hit
of
nn-dmt
i
had
just
watch
him
launch
off
on
his
own
journey
it
looked
strange
he
had
closed
his
eyes
and
felt
around
through
the
air
making
strange
humming
noises
occasionally
like
he
was
seeing
something
else
i
knew
it
would
be
intense

i
take
the
hit
it
is
my
first
time
and
i
know
little
of
what
to
expect
read
on

immediately
after
exhaling
i
raise
my
head
and
the
room
is
vibrating
very
quickly
and
this
is
quite
visible
on
objects
things
begin
to
change
depth
wildly
and
quickly
patterns
begin
to
unfold
over
objects
the
accelerating
continues
despite
this
and
soon
the
room
is
getting
difficult
to
recognize
my
thoughts
suddenly
break
contact
with
the
outside
world
and
understanding
is
severely
crippled
eyes
close
almost
involuntarily

suddenly
i
am
immersed
in
the
most
dense
intense
unprepared
voyage
of
my
entire
life

i
quickly
forced
my
eyes
open
as
around
the
room
my
cousin
and
friend
are
trying
to
talk
to
me
their
words
are
becoming
intermixed
and
suddenly
the
words
dont
match
their
mouths
i
instead
am
incredibly
fixated
on
their
facial
expressions
and
suddenly
i
can
read
their
thoughts
hes
really
getting
into
it
now
one
said
and
no
longer
can
i
keep
my
head
up

the
room
around
me
looked
like
a
painting
made
by
michaelangelo
a
tv
near
the
top
of
the
room
which
was
off
turned
into
a
heavenly
mirror
and
all
the
objects
seemed
to
be
sort
of
arranged
around
it
like
a
god
had
set
it
up
it
seemed
to
be
too
perfect
the
objects
were
raising
up
to
it
in
a
formation

the
visuals
were
getting
too
strange
nearly
if
not
disturbing
i
say
something
along
the
lines
of
its
like
an
instant
psychosis
to
which
my
much
older
friend
replies
in
a
way
yeah
i
become
nearly
nauseous
from
the
speed
of
the
experience
and
put
my
head
down
on
my
lap
but
for
some
reason
i
can
still
see
the
room
i
was
in
exactly
what
i
was
just
looking
at
but
just
shadows
of
the
people
and
objects
that
were
being
overcome
by
patterns
like
cogs
turning
in
a
machine
everything
kept
moving
like
i
kept
my
eyes
openbut
soon
even
this
begins
to
fade
out
seemingly
into
black

the
last
thing
i
hear
is
clearly
from
my
cousin
wow
well
i
wonder
how
deep
this
can
go

and
then
-
there
is
no
longer
james
a
human/primate
born
of
k
and
j
and
at
a
friends
house
doing
a
drug
what
is
a
drug
anyway
how
can
such
a
term
even
begin
to
describe
the
true
being
the
otherworldly
void
this
cant
be
a
drug
this
is
life
society
understanding
values
morals
distant
and
distinct
memories
my
role
my
status
any
predispositions
-
gone


scenes
like
a
slideshow
begin
appearing
just
as
realistic
as
the
room
around
me
looks
now
the
scene
formed
and
then
panned
in
the
direction
of
right
over
the
most
detailed
alive
and
real
metaphysical
pictures
i
have
ever
seen
no
artist
can
comprehend
this
no
human
brain
should
even
be
able
to
contain
this
amount
of
information
it
is
absolutely
insane
to
think
about

but
it
goes
even
further
then
that
soon
the
scene
in
front
of
me
dives
in
and
any
visible
hallucinations
are
lost
what
is
left
is
an
extremely
white
bright
shimmering
light
like
i
was
in
the
largest
most
surreal
and
beautiful
but
empty
room
ever
i
had
stopped
feeling
a
body
a
long
time
ago
i
was
no
longer
in
a
body
i
couldnt
comprehend
what
a
body
is
or
where
i
came
from
even
what
i
was
or
how
i
am
the
only
thing
left
was
what
i
consider
my
soul

just
a
single
point
of
consciousness
in
the
real
the
true
sea
of

creation
i
had
returned
home
to
pure
being
and
my
past
life
-
the
whole
lived
out
illusion
-
is
all
simply
a
very
strange
coincidental
occurrence
that
is
not
the
true
self
for
the
true
self
is
ultimately
part
of
something
much
larger
more
vast
and
all-including
every
single
sensory
thought
or
experience
all
merged
into
one
giant
never-ending
cosmic
entity
soon
this
panned
out
and
i
began
seeing
the
universe
but
it
wasnt
just
a
universe
it
was
a
multitude
of
universes
-
the
multi-verse
a
large
almost
writhing
with
constant
shifting
and
movement
to
and
from
different
universes/points
of
reference

any
possibilities
occurrences
past
and
future
and
right
now
was
all
going
on
simultaneously
in
front
of
me
i
began
to
see
hundreds
of
different
individuals
points
of
view
out
of
their
eyes
people
i
know
friends
relatives
and
people
id
like
to
know
suddenly
i
realized
that
i
was
alive
the
points
of
view
i
was
looking
at
of
had
to
be
something
i
knew
and
i
immediately
was
certain
i
was
seeing
what
other
people
were
seeing
at
that
exact
moment
i
remember
a
friend
whos
point
of
view
i
looked
out
of
specifically

gone
are
the
oddities
of
why
we
are
here
how
and
what
our
purpose
is
we
are
all
manifests
of
the
same
godly
single
conscience
and
i
truly
saw
my
life
for
what
it
was
a
cell
on
a
leaf
on
a
stick
on
a
larger
stick
on
a
branch
on
a
larger
branch
connected
to
the
biggest
redwood
in
the
largest
never-ending
forest
that
ever
existed
suddenly
everything
feels
perfect
pure
awe-inspiring
truly
completing
i
am
nothing
yet
everything
all
at
once
even
the
multi-verse
was
gone
now
and
visions
of
the
future
too
it
was
just
me

my
life
is
meaningless
but
at
the
same
time
-
truly
beautiful
to
be
able
to
behold
like
i
received
the
once-in-a-lifetime
chance
of
being
granted
outside
consciousness
to
see
all
of
thisand
appreciate
it
from
another
point
of
view
upon
death
i
will
return
to
what
i
was
before
-
a
true
wave
in
the
continuous
sea
of
existence
til
then
i
have
been
granted
the
opportunity
so
far
to
enjoy
all
of
this
as
a
part
of
the
intelligent
understanding
life
here
in
the
second
millenium
of
the
current
era
we
are
all
yet
another
facet
of
the
same
all-including
infinite
entity
in
its
constantly
continuing
simple
experience

i
probably
began
coming
down
when
i
realized
i
was
alive
again
i
noticed
an
extremely
clean
and
pure
feeling
and
realized
it
mustve
been
air
fresh
beautiful
air
going
in
and
out
of
my
system
i
still
didnt
feel
my
body
but
i
knew
i
had
to
be
breathing
something
oh
wait
i
do
breathe
and
its
fucking
wonderful
absolutely
perfect
actually
but
that
would
mean

within
a
period
of
5-10
seconds
the
white
light
suddenly
became
the
room
around
me
even
with
eyes
closed
i
saw
the
room
taking
shape
when
i
opened
them
finally
my
vision
was
surreal
and
full
of
life

i
immediately
stood
up
could
hardly
walk
for
a
second
this
is
perfect
i
immediately
exclaimed
for
some
reason
i
read
my
cousin
and
my
friends
mind
immediately
they
were
worried
about
how
long
my
trip
was
taking
as
i
had
to
be
heading
home
pretty
soon
i
had
been
completely
immobile
for
nearly
10
minutes
they
began
to
ask
me
if
it
was
good
and
i
said
yes
not
yeah
yep
etc
but
the
most
pronounced
and
almost
too
intellectual
yes
like
you
might
hear
someone
say
who
has
studied
english
very
hard
but
just
isnt
familiar
with
speaking
it

the
absolute
strongest
and
most
life-changing
experience
ive
ever
encountered
and
could
ever
imagine
encountering
i
had
completely
changed
the
process
of
my
brain
within
10
minutes
time
and
i
loved
it
i
walked
over
to
the
tv
and
grabbed
my
ipod
literally
right
after
i
stood
up
and
simultaneously
knew
i
had
to
be
leaving
soon
my
cousin
and
friend
were
shocked
at
how
much
i
had
gotten
out
of
it
and
we
immediately
began
to
walk
outside


there
wasnt
even
really
much
to
say
about
it
as
i
began
getting
in
the
car
suddenly
i
was
overcome
with
thirst
like
i
hadnt
had
water
in
hours
i
wasted
no
time
saying
im
going
to
need
to
get
some
water
and
my
friend
started
saying
he
had
locked
the
house
already
he
asked
if
id
like
to
get
some
water
from
the
hose
and
laughing
with
the
most
wonderful
of
joy
and
ecstasy
in
life
ran
with
him
all
the
way
over
to
his
water
hose
like
a
man
on
a
mission
i
took
sips
out
of
it
and
despite
the
water
being
public
water
and
most
likely
disgusting
it
was
the
most
cleansing
and
pure
tasting
drink
i
had
ever
experienced

it
was
then
that
i
realized
just
how
much
my
vision
was
still
affected
by
it
there
was
a
paradigm
shift
in
how
i
viewed
the
world
around
me
that
marked
the
drug
leaving
my
system
but
leaving
its
mark
on
me
for
good
for
about
the
next
hour
or
so
i
felt
what
i
wouldnt
even
call
a
high
i
was
living
and
it
couldnt
get
any
better

i
got
dropped
off
at
my
cousins
house
to
get
picked
up
my
car
was
broken
he
asked
if
i
would
be
okay
talking
to
my
aunt
if
i
had
to
to
which
i
responded
it
was
never
a
problem
i
did
indeed
have
to
talk
to
my
aunt
who
noticed
a
car
pulled
up
im
sure
she
thought
i
was
under
the
influence
but
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
been
so
kind
and
carefree
sounding
when
having
small
talk
i
told
her
i
would
not
need
to
go
inside
as
i
would
be
leaving
very
soon
and
she
walked
in
with
a
smile
on
her
face
that
i
almost
knew
recognized
that
i
was
tripping

i
went
home
and
dont
even
really
remember
anything
of
what
ensued
i
assume
i
fell
asleep
nearly
immediately
upon
arriving
there
i
awoke
the
next
morning
on
a
saturday
and
could
still
feel
the
beauty
nearly
as
strong
as
when
i
was
talking
to
my
aunt
the
day
before
i
quickly
was
inspired
and
ran
to
my
printer
pulling
out
a
large
sheet
of
paper
i
had
so
much
to
convey
and
began
drawing
i
drew
what
is
one
of
the
best
pictures
i
have
ever
created
and
used
shading/techniques/creativity
that
i
had
never
known
was
possible
it
looked
like
what
one
might
see
from
an
art
student
not
an
occasional
doodler
and
it
was
perfect

this
experience
still
is
my
strongest
to
date
and
i
do
not
regret
it
i
was
quite
young
but
mentally
was
never
really
my
age
anyway
i
believe
after
this
experience
that
i
became
a
lot
more
self-aware
i
seemed
more
here
like
i
was
actually
open
to
millions
of
new
things
around
me
that
before
i
had
noticed
but
didnt
think
was
important


i
saw
god
and
me
in
everything
and
still
do
i
began
witnessing
how
interaction
between
the
infinite
multi-verse
comes
together
to
create
the
reality
we
know
and
live
in
day
by
day
events
to
this
day
are
still
filled
with
magic
inspiration
and
purpose
i
get
what
is
going
on
around
me
but
also
noticed
that
i
lost
interest
in
trying
to
find
out
more
i
didnt
and
still
do
not
think
there
is
much
more
for
me
to
discover
through
psychedelics
although
i
do
enjoy
phenethylamines
with
friends
on
an
extremely
rare
occasion
i
however
do
not
take
high
doses
or
even
really
moderate
doses
anymore
of
anything
i
have
no
desire
to
do
dmt
ever
again
or
even
really
trip
on
anything
as
much
as
just
have
a
good
time
every
few
months
on
low
dosages

im
not
sure
if
i
ever
had
a
desire
to
do
it
but
i
did
do
it
and
i
would
never
have
had
it
any
other
way
i
realized
that
drugs
were
not
of
much
importance
to
me
and
that
i
spend
far
too
much
time
smoking
marijuana
and
not
enough
exploring
just
how
much
is
around
me
in
this
world

many
thanks
for
reading
this
far
and
may
you
have
health
and
good
fortune
in
your
entire
life
and
all
of
your
enterprises
if
anything
one
might
find
negative
came
out
of
this
is
that
i
dont
enjoy
doing
most
drugs
at
all
anymore
and
even
get
some
negative
effects
that
i
would
never
get
before
when
i
try
to
abuse
them
hard


this
however
is
wonderful
for
me
as
i
dont
think
that
is
my
purpose
i
dont
think
i
was
ever
meant
to
abuse
drugs
it
didnt
stop
me
smoking
marijuana
in
fact
i
probably
increased
my
marijuana
usage
after
that
but
it
sure
cut
me
down
to
size
just
about
everywhere
else

until
next
time
on
the
other
side




how
do
you
expect
the
unexpected
how
do
you
describe
the
indescribable
how
do
you
believe
the
unbelievable
and
how
do
you
question
the
unquestionably
flawless
intelligence
of
gods
mind
you
dont
you
sit
back
with
trusted
friends
you
raise
a
glass
pipe
to
your
lips
you
inhale
3
times
and
then
you
dive
soul
first
into
an
ocean
of
seamless
reality
that
either
washes
over
you
like
a
mother
bathing
her
child
or
crashes
onto
you
as
if
the
heavens
fell
from
the
skies
welcome
to
hyperspace

it
seems
i
only
post
after
a
particularly
enlightening
and
sensational
psychedelic
journey
and
i
suppose
thats
all
thats
needed
if
i
were
to
leave
the
epic
insights
of
tripping
to
mere
memory
im
afraid
id
lose
the
vast
majority
of
it
to
the
constant
bombardment
of
constricted
thinking
close
minded
perceptions
and
petty
emotions
that
race
through
my
mind
daily
a
documented
reference
to
mystical
experiences
serves
to
capture
and
savor
my
fleeting
glimpses
of
divine
truth

the
day
was
set
and
the
participants
selected
we
sat
in
humble
unison
on
the
floor
as
shpongle
accentuated
the
atmosphere
with
an
ominous
foreshadowing
of
events
to
come
there
was
limited
conversation
as
the
pipe
was
being
loaded
with
a
yellow
crystal
that
seemed
to
unconsciously
demand
respect
there
were
6
of
us
3
newcomers
and
3
experienced
dmt
travelers
yet
all
of
us
nervously
waited
for
someone
else
to
volunteer
for
the
first
smoke
a
timid
ill
go
first
broke
the
silence
but
i
followed
with
i
will
if
youd
like
ill
go
first
i
figured
someone
vaguely
familiar
with
the
power
of
dmt
should
handle
the
inauguration
of
the
sacrament
while
simultaneously
being
reminded
by
another
traveler
the
product
was
extracted
by
my
hands
it
would
only
be
right
for
me
to
christen
it

it
was
then
that
my
heart
began
to
pound
i
was
nearly
overwhelmed
by
the
impending
intoxication
that
would
soon
be
take
control
of
my
senses
after
exhaling
my
first
hit
though
i
was
immersed
in
what
seemed
like
a
warm
electric
bath
so
encompassing
so
reassuring
i
exhaled
my
second
hit
deeper
now
i
sank
into
a
lake
of
exotic
visions
i
only
opened
my
eyes
to
see
the
pipe
for
a
third
toke
as
i
exhaled
again
a
fabric
of
warping
designs
gave
way
to
a
female
being
who
seemed
to
offer
herself
to
me
without
consciously
deciding
i
observed
myself
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
throwing
myself
upon
her

immediately
i
pulled
myself
up
i
realized
there
are
more
important
things
to
do
and
decided
to
explore
i
then
saw
countless
people
walking
frantically
from
place
to
place
it
felt
like
i
was
in
a
restaurant
watching
servers
bustle
about
working
on
something
they
were
quite
indifferent
to
me
being
there
as
the
drug
metabolized
in
my
body
the
world
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
disappearing
into
blackness
i
opened
my
eyes
physically
and
emotionally
i
felt
quite
refreshed
but
felt
spiritually
lacking
as
if
i
had
missed
something
slightly
disappointed
but
otherwise
completely
tranquil
and
thankful
for
having
a
pleasant
experience
we
sat
in
silence
once
more
as
the
pipe
was
being
loaded

4
more
people
smoked
but
none
attained
a
breakthrough
experience

then
the
person
who
had
first
volunteered
for
the
first
trip
was
up
she
took
4
solid
and
thorough
hits
and
for
5
to
ten
minutes
we
watched
as
she
undeniably
broke
through
it
was
very
powerful
watching
her
lifting
and
raising
her
head
while
breathing
heavily
and
sensuously
eyes
closed
and
soul
deep
after
she
came
back
into
this
material
view
of
things
she
slowly
elaborated
on
what
happened
i
then
inspected
the
pipe
and
figured
there
was
sufficient
amount
of
buildup
still
inside
the
bulb
to
attempt
another
session
of
my
own
by
this
point
though
i
think
i
was
under
appreciating
the
awesome
power
of
dmt
after
feeling
a
tad
shortchanged
by
my
initial
experience
and
apparently
ignoring
the
intense
behaviors
of
the
previous
traveler

first
hit
long
and
slow
i
hold
deep
10
seconds
at
least
exhale
damn
this
is
heavy
i
hand
the
pipe
to
friend
so
i
wouldnt
have
to
worry
about
holding
it
myself
2nd
hit
i
dunno
if
i
like
this
my
heart
is
pounding
and
my
lungs
are
sore
from
my
first
trip
im
in
a
state
of
unease
and
paranoia
i
cant
die
from
this
right
my
awareness
is
harassed
by
an
onslaught
of
frightening
thoughts
and
a
menacing
carpet
of
hallucinations
obscuring
my
view
i
dont
want
anymore
the
pipe
is
smoking
and
ready
for
a
third
hit
i
dont
want
to
back
down
but
i
dont
want
to
go
further
my
chest
is
pounding
i
think
im
dying
i
press
my
lips
against
the
glass
and
drag
my
lungs
are
so
raped
its
hard
to
keep
inhaling
but
i
manage
i
hold
in
exhale
blast
off
god
damn
where
i
am
i
want
to
go
home
my
chest
feels
as
if
there
is
a
hole
in
it
as
if
my
heart
is
missing
this
is
so
painful
im
alone
im
scared
and
i
want
my
heart
back
i
want
to
be
alright
wait
what
is
this
what
is
this
presence
around
me
am
i
not
alone

im
in
a
room
there
are
two
adults
female
and
male
i
sense
their
glorious
power
it
flows
off
them
like
the
sun
radiates
light
i
am
a
child
here
ignorant
frightened
and
confused
i
only
see
them
from
their
waist
down
to
their
feet
i
dont
even
try
to
look
up
to
them
i
am
not
worthy
im
not
the
only
child
there
is
a
table/box
full
of
toys
and
there
is
a
young
child
exploring
them
my
god
this
is
so
intense
i
dunno
if
i
like
it
panic
grips
my
body
once
again
everything
is
so
alien
and
terrifying
wait
im
here
im
right
here
right
now
ive
dreamed
of
being
here
ive
fantasied
about
meeting
these
beings
ive
prayed
for
conclusive
answers
possibly
arising
from
a
breakthrough
experience
and
here
i
am
why
am
i
clinging
so
tight
to
my
thoughts
and
emotions
why
not
investigate
forget
life
and
death
absorb
myself
into
what
is
happening
right
now

im
in
the
room
and
without
speaking
i
ask
the
adults
why
im
here
immediately
she
hands
me
a
toy
i
look
at
it
its
some
magnificent
geometrical
building
block
i
stare
into
it
focus
entirely
on
it
it
begins
to
glow
bright
i
focus
harder
it
glows
brighter
it
transmits
an
energy
to
me
something
familiar
the
feeling
overwhelms
me
and
it
feels
heavenly
my
god
this
is
true
love
and
i
felt
it
before
my
heart
is
back
again
there
is
no
more
hole
just
complete
wholeness
i
look
back
up
at
the
child
playing
with
the
toys
he
is
so
happy
now
he
begins
tossing
his
toys
into
the
air
in
celebration
and
it
hits
me
this
is
the
love
i
have
for
my
son
it
is
a
reflection
of
my
intense
feelings
for
him

unexpectedly
im
reminded
of
all
the
times
i
havent
been
the
best
father
im
capable
of
being
im
reminded
of
my
thoughts
of
moving
some
where
else
not
to
leave
him
but
to
start
fresh
some
where
else
and
to
visit
him
when
i
can
these
thoughts
instantly
wrench
my
heart
from
my
chest
i
am
sucked
into
a
tornado
of
hellish
anxiety
utter
despair
and
guilt
no
i
cannot
i
will
not
leave
him
he
is
my
inspiration
for
living
and
without
him
i
will
die
whether
it
be
physically
emotionally
or
spiritually
or
all
3
i
will
wither
into
nothingness
without
his
love
as
soon
as
i
realize
this
i
am
back
in
the
room
the
adults
are
moving
about
quicker
now
as
if
in
a
hurry
i
start
thanking
them
for
showing
me
this
and
how
beautiful
it
is
i
begin
to
get
teary
eyed
by
thinking
about
my
emotions
and
again
i
am
filled
with
a
veil
of
hallucinations
that
depict
love
and
remorse
i
realize
that
i
am
under
the
influence
of
a
short
acting
drug
and
i
need
to
go
back
to
the
room
before
i
lose
touch
with
it

im
back
in
the
room
the
adults
are
running
now
and
things
are
starting
to
git
dimmer
and
dimmer
i
ask
what
else
they
have
to
show
me
the
female
strikes
me
as
if
reprimanding
a
child
as
if
she
was
saying
listen
now
pay
attention
stop
drifting
off
this
is
important
she
then
hands
me
a
mystical
looking
hourglass
as
she
squats
down
she
is
in
full
view
now
and
i
can
feel
her
love
pouring
over
me
she
reaches
in
and
pulls
a
handful
of
the
most
serene
white
glistening
sand
imaginable
and
allows
it
to
fall
i
reach
my
hands
out
and
catch
it
it
flows
through
my
fingers
and
it
is
orgasmic
pure
love
is
all
about
and
as
this
sand
slides
into
my
hand
and
slips
through
the
cracks
of
my
fingers
i
understand
what
she
is
telling
me
time
is
the
most
precious
thing
we
have
it
is
fantastic
and
inconceivable
it
is
also
as
brief
and
fleeting
as
every
grain
of
sand
that
falls
through
the
cracks
of
my
hand
use
the
time
you
are
given
wisely
enjoy
the
precious
moments
of
life
and
celebrate
them
with
your
son
your
life
is
only
as
full
and
rich
as
you
make
it
and
your
son
is
the
measure
of
your
worth
fade
to
black

i
cry
i
begin
to
shake
and
i
try
my
hardest
to
convey
the
deepest
of
thanks
to
these
beings
they
opened
my
eyes
to
the
beauty
of
life
that
has
always
been
in
front
of
my
face
ive
always
known
he
was
my
purpose
but
to
have
something
someone
so
powerful
demonstrate
so
explicitly
how
meaningful
he
is
was
jaw
dropping
i
cry
some
more
i
open
my
eyes
and
everyone
sits
in
silence
the
energy
in
the
room
is
sublime
i
wipe
my
tears
and
say
my
goodbyes




let
me
preface
this
account
by
saying
i
have
had
many
previous
experiences
with
psychedelics
which
i
believe
properly
prepared
me
for
my
first
dmt
trip

this
experience
occurred
this
past
weekend
at
the
gathering
of
the
vibes
music
festival
in
bridgeport
ct
my
friend
and
i
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
dealer
in
the
campsite
who
not
only
had
some
very
kind
dope
but
also
dmt
we
purchased
a
½
gram
over
the
course
of
the
last
few
months
id
been
avidly
reading
about
dmt
experiences
and
was
very
curious
and
excited
to
try
it
for
myself
my
plan
was
to
trip
on
mushrooms
that
evening
and
try
the
dmt
early
the
following
day
that
night
while
shrooming
i
made
a
conscious
effort
to
continuously
direct
strong
positive
thoughts
towards
myself
and
my
place
in
the
universe
i
was
hoping
to
cultivate
a
strong
positive
experience
with
the
dmt
the
next
day
as
i
had
read
of
people
having
very
difficult
experiences
with
the
drug


the
next
day
my
friend
and
i
found
a
spot
on
the
beach
directly
across
from
the
\x93green
vibes
stage
where
one
musical
act
was
ending
and
other
beginning
to
tune
up
i
sat
back
in
a
lawn
chair
facing
long
island
sound
and
proceeded
to
prepare
my
pipe
i
was
somewhat
concerned
because
id
read
many
peoples
accounts
of
the
proper
way
to
smoke
dmt
water
pipes
vaporizers
butane
lighters
etc
and
i
had
none
of
those
things
only
a
very
small
glass
piece
and
a
run
of
the
mill
lighter
still
i
could
not
help
but
be
aware
at
this
point
of
a
strong
sense
of
purpose
around
what
i
was
about
to
attempt
it
was
palpable
this
feeling
that
i
was
supposed
to
be
right
here
right
now
using
the
tip
of
a
pen
cap
i
measured
very
approximately
10-15
milligrams
of
the
brownish-yellow
power
onto
the
weed
in
my
piece
then
i
covered
it
with
another
small
bud


since
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
i
gave
my
friend
simple
instructions


1take
the
piece
from
me
when
i
finish

2if
i
appear
to
be
in
any
kind
of
distress
say
nothing
just
hold
my
hand

the
wind
coming
off
the
water
was
strong
and
so
i
pulled
a
towel
over
my
head
and
lit
up
i
lit
the
bowl
slowly
drawing
a
deep
breath
and
holding
the
smoke
in
my
lungs
for
about
20-30
seconds
upon
exhalation
i
tasted
pot
and
nothing
else
i
waited
about
two
minutes
and
while
i
was
definitely
stoned
i
knew
i
hadnt
gotten
a
good
enough
hit
of
the
dmt
i
asked
my
friend
to
sprinkle
in
some
more
and
thankfully
he
instead
suggested
i
try
one
more
hit
first
i
hit
it
again
and
this
time
i
instantly
became
aware
of
a
sharp
acrid
flavor
filling
my
lungs
and
nostrils
believing
id
hit
gold
i
took
in
as
much
smoke
as
possible
and
held
it
for
a
full
thirty
seconds
before
exhaling
i
slumped
back
in
my
lawn
chair
and
took
note
of
the
clear
cloud
tickled
sky


about
5
seconds
after
laying
back
i
became
aware
of
a
kind
of
\x93film
drawing
down
over
my
vision
i
recall
thinking
at
that
time
it
looks
like
several
large
parameciums
have
landed
on
my
eyeballs
they
undulated
and
slid
with
ease
slippery
living
pools
of
near-invisible
protoplasm
speckled
and
busy
indeed


i
watched
the
clouds
and
sky
from
behind
this
odd
primordial
curtain
and
then
became
aware
of
a
warm
numbness
cascading
down
my
cheeks
and
throat
my
heart
was
beating
rapidly
and
i
knew
i
was
on
my
way
there
was
no
fear
at
this
time
yet
there
was
the
idea
of
fear
fear
floated
over
to
the
right
side
of
my
consciousness
and
i
sensed
its
selfish
desire
to
assert
itself
instead
i
turned
my
attention
away
and
to
the
sounds
of
the
band
still
tuning
up
on
stage
i
knew
that
once
some
music
began
the
fear
would
not
have
the
resources
to
stick
around
me
and
i
would
be
on
my
way
towards
something
wonderful


the
band
seemed
to
take
forever
to
launch
into
a
song
i
was
aware
that
the
noise
of
the
front
man
going
on
and
on
about
\x93how
good
it
is
to
be
here
on
this
beautiful
friday
etc
etc
had
taken
on
a
deep
vibrating
quality
it
was
as
if
the
sound
was
being
picked
up
and
amplified
not
in
my
ear
drums
but
in
the
very
center
of
my
body
and
traveling
outward
from
within
my
heart
beat
faster
and
the
thought
that
this
band
may
never
play
a
song
allowed
the
fear
to
draw
in
closer
and
begin
to
take
hold


it
was
at
this
time
that
the
music
finally
exploded
out
into
the
air
and
i
experienced
blastoff
the
numbness
that
had
begun
on
my
face
quickly
cascaded
down
the
rest
of
me
and
i
was
separated
entirely
from
my
physical
form
i
closed
my
eyes
but
the
sky
with
its
glorious
clouds
remained
but
then
began
to
shift
and
split
as
a
series
of
brightly
colored
spiral
fractals
spun
down
from
beyond
the
sky
the
lines
of
this
fractal
were
thin
and
clearly
something
small
within
them
too
tiny
to
see
was
moving
the
cloud/sky
space
between
the
fractal
lines
suddenly
darkened
and
began
to
pulse
with
a
sickly
purple
bruised
color
i
understood
that
this
was
the
fear
that
was
still
traveling
right
along
with
me
the
only
part
of
my
body
that
remained
was
my
heart
which
i
became
sure
would
soon
explode


then
there
was
a
voice
i
use
the
word
\x93voice
in
the
loosest
sense
for
what
i
really
experienced
was
the
\x93knowing
of
another
given
to
me
i
heard
it
audibly
but
felt
it
just
as
clearly
and
simultaneously
saw
the
message
as
it
unfurled
on
a
bright
white
banner
that
drew
itself
across
the
sick
purple-fear
expanse
its
edges
attaching
each
one
of
the
pretty
fractal
spirals
written
on
the
banner
clear
as
day
was
the
message

you
have
taken
a
powerful
psychedelic

this
message
experienced
visually
audibly
and
within
my
consciousness
was
undoubtedly
female
there
was
no
tone
to
lend
it
a
friendly
or
unfriendly
disposition
it
was
simply
supplying
me
with
information

i
continued
to
soar
forward
another
banner/voice/feeling
delivered
by
this
female
voice
shot
across
my
conscious
it
said


we
want
to
see
you
but
you
have
to
slow
down
your
breathing
first
take
deep
breaths


upon
receiving
this
advice
i
was
aware
of
a
new
presence
of
mind
within
me
while
i
was
primarily
in
a
state
of
heightened
wonder
and
no
small
degree
of
panic
what
rose
up
within
me
was
a
kind
of
no-nonsense
cold
rationality
that
initiated
within
me
a
deep
rhythmic
breathing
exercise
id
practiced
often
in
meditation
as
i
breathed
the
pulsing
sick
purple
fear
masses
began
to
dissipate
while
the
spiral
lines
grew
thicker
and
expanded
outward
i
picked
up
speed
and
was
very
very
faintly
aware
that
far
below
where
my
body
sat
a
strong
ocean
wind
was
blowing
against
my
face


suddenly
i
became
aware
of
shapes
that
were
attempting
to
break
through
the
multicolored
surface
of
the
fractal
spirals
there
was
a
pushing
upward
until
finally
out
popped
a
small
perfectly
spherical
and
bright
green
head
it
spun
and
smiled
wide
at
me
its
eyes
two
mere
slits
of
hilarity
before
fully
popping
out
of
the
surface
and
beginning
to
dance
along
with
the
music
then
i
spotted
another
then
another
soon
the
spiral
fractal
completed
its
formation
of
an
endless
tunnel
made
up
completely
of
these
green
dancing
men
i
was
familiar
with
the
accounts
of
machine
elves
these
looked
more
like
the
doozers
from
fraggle
rock
which
some
of
you
might
remember
they
danced
in
unison
and
began
to
speak
to
me

\x93hooray
you
made
it

\x93were
so
glad
youre
here

\x93weve
been
waiting
for
you
to
find
us
again

\x93hooray

i
simply
marveled
at
this
and
was
distantly
aware
that
back
on
earth
my
body
was
laughing
every
so
often
a
sickly
purple
head
would
pop
out
of
the
fractal
and
suddenly
there
would
be
an
angry
little
man
with
a
frown
made
of
pure
electricity
he
would
stare
at
me
and
say
something
profoundly
distressing
like


\x93now
youre
dying

\x93youre
going
insane
forever

\x93your
best
friend
hates
you

however
before
any
real
fear
could
gather
itself
one
or
more
of
the
happy
green
men
would
surround
the
purple
guy
and
kick
and/or
karate
chop
him
off
the
fractal
and
into
a
dark
center
that
was
slowly
revealing
itself
at
the
center
of
everything
as
they
did
this
they
would
say
things
like

\x93dont
listen
to
him
hes
just
confused

\x93hell
come
back
understanding
better
the
next
time

\x93youre
doing
great
hooray

suddenly
i
became
aware
of
a
tremendous
insight
into
what
i
was
experiencing
this
insight
was
presented
to
me
again
through
several
medium
at
once
i
was
being
told
it
by
the
green
men
i
was
seeing
the
truth
of
it
in
the
pattern
materialized
before
me
as
though
the
mere
existence
of
this
image
ensured
it
was
true
as
well
as
being
struck
by
a
strong
familiarity
from
the
experience
as
a
whole
the
insight
was
this

this
was
the
force
of
the
universe
of
creation
of
everything
it
is
continuously
moving
working
itself
into
higher
and
higher
consciousness
the
images
before
me
were
just
that
images
created
by
my
mind
to
give
form
to
what
is
essentially
formless
the
green
men
illustrated
this
last
point
by
suddenly
looking
at
me
and
saying
\x93we
can
be
whatever
you
want
we
can
be
chipmunks
and
they
became
chipmunks
\x93we
can
be
fire
hydrants
and
they
all
became
fire
hydrants
\x93it
doesnt
matter
hooray
and
then
returned
to
little
green
men

i
understood
that
this
dancing
this
moving
was
really
them
working
towards
the
higher
consciousness
and
that
back
on
earth
this
gleeful
dancing
manifested
in
the
acts
of
kindness
love
and
generosity
of
people
towards
each
other
i
understood
that
our
physical
reality
including
the
notions
of
time
and
space
was
merely
a
reflection
caused
by
the
vibrating
energy
of
this
process
and
was
not
\x93real
in
any
sense
of
the
word
the
true
nature
of
everything
was
vibration
and
it
emanated
and
danced
around
a
singular
point
of
nothingness
this
nothingness
i
came
to
understand
was
all
there
ever
was
or
ever
will
be
however
the
notion
of
\x93nothing
naturally
implies
the
idea
of
\x93something\x97and
that
is
what
we
are
the
implication
of
possibility
generated
by
the
truth
of
utter
nothingness


as
if
to
demonstrate
this
point
i
was
shown
snapshots
of
events
from
throughout
my
life
from
infant
years
to
events
from
that
very
day
the
picture
of
the
event
say
for
example
the
birth
of
my
daughter
or
me
falling
off
the
slide
in
3rd
grade
would
fill
my
field
of
vision
then
it
would
freeze
like
a
snapshot
and
grown
smaller
and
smaller
until
the
spiral
fractal
tunnel
returned
and
the
snapshot
was
being
held
in
the
hands
by
one
of
the
green
men
who
would
then
toss
it
back
into
the
nothingness

\x93see
its
just
a
picture
hooray

\x93this
is
all
thats
real

\x93us

\x93you

the
concepts
of
\x93us
and
\x93me
and
the
very
concept
of
separation
as
a
whole
suddenly
manifested
itself
as
a
giant
billboard
and
that
too
was
snap-shotted
and
tossed
away
into
the
nothing

\x93this
is
all
it
is
everything
is
one
you
are
it
everyone
is

\x93this
is
it


this
insight
was
celebrated
by
a
massive
\x93hooray
by
the
green
men
then
went
on
to
say
things
like

\x93its
so
simple

\x93yeah
you
see
it
now


\x93were
so
glad
you
see
it

\x93its
you
its
everything


then
they
all
simultaneously
donned
black
graduation
caps
and
gowns
removed
a
certificate
of
graduation
from
behind
them
stamped
it
signed
and
held
it
up
to
me
while
giving
me
a
big
\x93thumbs
up


\x93okay
back
to
work
lets
go
hooray

the
spiral
tunnel
gradually
began
to
slow
and
grow
thinner
from
behind
this
vision
i
began
to
make
out
the
frail
outlines
of
clouds
and
sky
the
music
continued
to
jam
on
and
my
fingers
began
to
tap
the
arms
of
the
lawn
chair
i
was
returning
to
my
body
with
my
eyes
now
open
i
could
still
see
the
little
green
men
who
continued
to
dance
in
circles
behind
the
sky
faintly
they
cried

\x93come
back
again
soon

\x93were
always
here

\x93wed
love
you
see
you

\x93good
job
today
hooray

i
sat
up
and
looked
at
my
friend
who
promptly
said

\x9315
minutes
you
were
there
for
15
minutes

the
very
notion
of
time
was
still
absurd
to
me
as
i
still
felt
primarily
within
the
reality
of
the
spiral
truth
as
opposed
to
the
physical
realm
this
euphoric
feeling
of
belonging
and
beauty
remained
with
me
throughout
the
weekend
though
the
exact
nature
and
profound
sense
of
truth
and
familiarity
of
the
experience
has
begun
to
fade
away
i
have
however
continued
to
have
faint
closed
eye
visuals
as
late
as
last
night
2
days
later
this
account
is
the
best
i
could
surmise
and
approximate
the
experience

i
cant
wait
to
go
back
there
again
and
see
some
more




[note
for
about
a
month
before
this
experience
i
was
taking
200mg
sertraline
zoloft
once
daily
i
discontinued
use
36
hours
before
the
experience]

at
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
we
were
sitting
around
a
friends
living
room
with
a
respectable
quantity
of
dmt
and
lsd
it
was
my
first
experiment
with
dmt
though
id
been
on
high
doses
of
lsd
salvia
and
mushrooms
before

the
first
hit
of
the
dmt
that
i
did
made
me
feel
cold
and
weird
and
gave
me
tunnel
vision
i
did
a
second
hit
and
held
it
in
for
some
time
i
felt
myself
melting
into
the
couch
and
my
head
lolled
to
the
side
the
room
around
me
fracturing
into
twisting
pinwheels
of
rainbow-colored
light
before
my
eyelids
drooped
shut
i
panicked
a
bit
at
first
because
the
stuff
was
so
strong
that
i
couldnt
control
my
body
but
soon
enough
my
ego
completely
flatlined
taking
my
worries
with
it

i
didnt
know
or
care
who
or
where
i
was
before
me
was
a
huge
carousel
of
somberly
shaded
purple
grey
and
blue
lights
i
seemed
to
hover
nearer
and
further
away
from
it
when
i
began
coming
back
the
room
was
swirling
in
a
twisting
vortex
of
multicolored
light
spiritual
sensations
and
ideation
were
completely
absent
from
the
trip
these
would
come
soon
enough
though

for
some
minutes
afterward
i
felt
a
euphoric
lift
it
was
now
about
6
in
the
evening
and
with
both
my
best
friend
and
myself
having
smoked
a
dose
of
dmt
each
we
decided
to
drop
the
first
hit
of
acid
we
each
dropped
a
second
hit
about
fifteen
minutes
afterward

by
8
oclock
the
acid
began
to
peak
my
trip
centered
around
patterns
in
perceptual
streams
much
like
the
last
time
i
did
acid
and
i
meditated
about
layers
of
depersonalized
intentions
behind
perceptions
for
hours
often
losing
entire
grasp
of
who
i
was
as
the
room
around
me
twisted
shivered
and
swelled
into
patches
of
rainbows
i
began
to
feel
that
the
lsd
had
initiated
some
sort
of
autodeconstructive
process
in
the
stream
of
perceptions
constituting
my
identity
this
was
somewhat
frightening
but
also
exhilarating
as
i
began
to
realize
what
it
meant
for
our
whole
universe
to
be
reflected
in
electrochemical
interactions
between
cells
which
could
then
be
reconfigured
in
a
way
that
temporarily
altered
the
fabric
of
the
universe
pretty
standard
stuff
for
lsd
use
my
trip
felt
very
material
except
at
times
when
i
would
feel
strange
creeping
flows
of
spiritual
energy
slither
through
the
room
i
managed
to
write
the
following
at
1019
that
night
while
the
peak
was
still
going
strong
and
my
ego
was
totally
gone



\x93to
chronicle
the
cognitive
distortions
during
an
lsd
peak
requires
the
utmost
concentration
and
focus
because
the
acid-smattering
weirdo-collision
universe
is
out
there
and
my
thoughts
dont
know
where
i
am
when
im
thinking
them

the
body
is
strangely
alienated
from
me
as
well
as
my
cognitive
processes
some
of
which
twist
into
crystal
fractal
dimensions
very
far
away
from
where
they
started
thats
the
beauty
of
lsd\x97the
surprises
i
reach
out
from
behind
the
corner
and
frighten
myself
or
catch
myself
catching
myself
catching
myself

the
sensorium
is
obviously
broken
or
dislocated
somehow\x97disarticulated
but
its
the
resulting
logical
fragments
that
are
truly
terrifying
the
most
bizarre
and
interesting
aspect
of
being
on
acid
is
that
the
sensorium
has
been
totally
disarticulated
and
reconfigured\x97i
dont
know
where
sights
sounds
feelings
etc
begin
or
end
and
i
begin
or
end
in
these
data
flows
losing
myself
in
tides
of
beautiful
colors
and
profoundly
sadly
incommunicable
emotions
some
of
the
phenomena
of
my
consciousness
seem
stereotypical
and
weirdly
trite\x97it
allows
me
to
see
the
tides
of
media
corruption
cartoony
weirdness
creeping
as
a
constant
undercurrent
in
my
thinking

its
that
multicolored
stew
underlying
all
perceptions\x97making
them
swirl
together
when
the
flows
of
sensation
become
interrupted
patterns
emerge
in
them
that
reveal
intentions
that
are
not
my
own
thats
the
origin
of
empathy
the
problem
of
empathy
is
really
what
im
after
isnt
it
the
problem
of
empathy
with
things
that
arent
me
the
whole
wide
wide
material
universe
isnt
me
thats
the
central
thing
that
most
people
cant
grasp
the
absolute
horrifying
endlessly
multivarious
and
splentrificalifying
multiweirdoverse

the
profound
sadness
of
realizing
theres
nothing
there
to
realize\x97thats
why
i
do
hallucinogens
a
perverse
sort
of
jadedness
with
all
sensory
and
emotional
input
because
in
striving
for
an
absolutely
different
sensation
i
lose
track
of
what
i
am
in
trying
to
realize
theres
nothing
to
realize
something
interferes
between
the
realizer
and
the
abstract
happening
of
eventoweirdliness
theres
a
process
trying
to
deconstruct
itself\x97a
pattern
that
emerges
in
the
conscious
flow
of
perception
and
then
catches
itself\x97trying
to
realize
what
it
is
but
in
viewing
itself
it
unwinds
again
into
strangeliness

it
takes
lsd
to
realize
the
true
nightmare
horror
strangeliness
of
perceptions
piecing
and
stitching
themselves
into
the
pattern
of
a
person
which
is
always
endlessly
re-echoed
in
electrochemical
reactions
that
splinter
apart
and
break
up
and
reconfigure
the
thing
that
thought
it
was
thinking
about
them

there
are
levels
of
impersonality
and
automatism
personality
isnt
simply
an
on/off
switch
when
i
turn
off
the
light
of
the
ego
identity
the
perceptions
can
take
on
their
own
logic
and
re-echo
endlessly
it
takes
lsd
to
realize
the
profound
sadness
of
our
whole
universe
being
merely
electrochemical
states
that
are
disrupted
but
of
course
that
simple
mechanism
is
inadequate
for
lsd
also
reveals
that
there
is
something
pulling
the
strings
thats
what
i
try
not
to
remember
that
the
acid
is
telling
me
that
something
is
pulling
the
strings
of
my
perceptions
that
isnt
me

there
are
multiple
not
mes
in
fact
an
endlessly
re-echoing
not
me
thats
all
the
material
universe
really
is\x97a
place
where
i
am
not
i
can
grasp
then
the
really
startlingly
simple
correspondences
that
german
idealism
is
trying
to
grapple
with\x97the
perceptions
autodeconstruct
themselves
in
an
endlessly
byzantinely
complex
fashion\x97when
they
begin
trying
to
realize
what
they
are
they
initiate
a
series
of
logical
states
that
takes
over
the
show
and
the
syntax
of
the
sentence
obviously
thats
probably
another
problem
with
lsd\x97the
linguistic
faculties
are
all
fucked
up
too
and
theyre
trying
to
reveal
these
endlessly
complex
perceptual
processes
with
nothing
really
behind
them

one
thing
thats
interesting
about
the
lsd
is
that
it
makes
certain
reaches
of
thought
certain
images
certain
lines
of
self
that
arent
normally
privileged
come
alive
the
self
begins
to
figure
out
that
all
consciousness
is
a
matter
of
puppetry
layers
upon
layers
of
perceptions
and
automatism
coordinating
the
perceptions
with
nothing
at
the
core
theres
a
fundamental
mismatch
at
the
core
and
then
the
glitch
just
plays
itself
out
with
a
tragically
necessary
logic
thats
what
a
human
personality
is\x97culture
pulling
the
strings
and
making
the
perceptions
dance
in
a
way
that
convinces
most
people
theres
a
semblance
of
a
person
there
but
really
theres
nothing

and
one
begins
to
figure
out
the
cavernous
emptiness
of
the
universe
when
it
becomes
unclear
whether
its
contained
inside
the
skull
or
not
perhaps
it
could
never
be
contained
in
a
human
skull
these
things
were
never
meant
for
these
poor
blind
ugly
organic
beings
on
this
rock
in
the
middle
of
so
much
so
much
unending
nothingificating
unconsciousness\x97the
oddity
of
the
oddverse
that
isnt
so
much
me
anymore
revealing
that
so
much
of
human
personality
is
just
this
tragically
simple
game
of
heres
the
thing
now
take
it
away

once
i
begin
to
realize
how
frightening
it
is
that
the
endless
multivarious
complexity
of
the
material
universe
could
be
echoed
in
anything
when
i
begin
to
think
that
what
is
reflecting
the
endless
complexity
of
the
material
universe
isnt
a
mirror
or
an
unbroken
surface
of
water
but
this
blind
labyrinth
of
cells
firing
action
potentials
in
the
darkness
of
somethings
skull
on
a
rock
that
no
one
can
see
except
for
the
seers
of
the
rock\x97the
rest
of
the
universe
is
a
blind
staring
undark
light
no
wonder
these
patterns
of
consciousness
can
never
pull
themselves
together
thats
what
styles
do\x97they
string
perceptions
together
into
a
self
but
normally
the
unconscious
is
there
its
a
tape
of
weird
unprocessable
thoughts
sense
data
etc
what
about
all
that
sense
data
my
brain
is
excluding
those
populations
of
neurons
are
making
decisions
about
what
to
show
me
and
what
not
to
show
me
that
are
separate
from
the
phenomena
of
volition
but
the
lsd
reveals
how
frightening
it
is
to
have
such
a
muddy
medium
be
the
reflecting
mirror
for
such
a
complex
darkness



when
the
acid
had
lost
just
enough
intensity
for
us
to
realize
where
we
were
and
what
we
were
doing
we
decided
to
smoke
the
rest
of
the
dmt
we
loaded
another
dose
into
one
of
the
pipes
wed
been
smoking
out
of
before
and
began
to
inhale
it
didnt
take
me
long
to
blast
off
the
first
few
times
we
hit
the
pipe
were
almost
too
bewildering
to
recall
but
afterward
i
began
to
see
huge
grids
of
rainbow
light
twisting
and
warping
like
a
film
of
oil
on
the
surface
of
a
puddle
of
water
this
began
to
subside
and
then
one
of
my
friends
informed
us
that
he
could
scrape
together
a
bowl
of
pot
resin
we
placed
this
in
the
bowl
of
a
bong
wed
been
smoking
dmt
out
of
earlier
and
inhaled

the
pot
resin
mixed
with
the
dmt
and
began
to
get
us
incredibly
high
we
couldnt
even
feel
the
thc
at
first
as
we
were
sucking
in
so
much
dmt
however
i
feel
that
the
thc
complemented
the
lsd
and
the
dmt
making
the
perceptual
phenomena
generated
by
both
chemicals
gel
somehow
the
first
times
i
smoked
the
dmt
on
the
acid
the
chemicals
seemed
to
clash
with
the
dmt
overtaking
the
lsd
it
took
the
pot
to
bind
the
hallucinogenic
sensorium
together
into
a
coherent
world

after
lazing
around
on
couches
and
smoking
dmt
and
pot
for
about
an
hour
my
eyes
drifted
shut
and
i
began
to
see
incredibly
complex
prismatic
entities
mayan
gods
shaped
like
stone
fish
with
mouths
opening
and
spewing
out
clouds
of
single-cell
organisms
lizards
comets
clouds
multitudes
of
anteaters
drooping
down
the
sides
of
a
cliff
the
canopy
of
a
rain
forest
at
night
seen
from
below
as
if
i
were
lying
on
the
ground
splitting
into
kaleidoscopic
reflections
of
itself
in
drops
of
water
which
wriggled
into
the
shapes
of
frogs
my
whole
body
would
fragment
shattering
into
furry
mammals
and
snakes
which
would
scamper
and
slither
into
the
undergrowth
at
other
times
my
arms
and
legs
twisted
into
vines
tree
limbs
and
roots

most
of
the
imagery
i
saw
was
incredibly
complex
constantly
shifting
and
interlacing
like
gothic
foliation
but
made
up
of
tropical
vines
galaxies
and
molecules
sometimes
this
imagery
would
turn
into
patterns
like
those
in
aztec
or
mayan
architecture
i
began
to
feel
my
soul
being
flooded
with
spiritual
energy
my
mind
blossomed
into
a
huge
ornate
temple
and
images
of
various
unrecognizable
gods
danced
through
it
i
placed
my
hands
together
and
held
them
over
my
head
to
direct
a
blasting
column
of
light
into
my
skull
at
other
times
everything
around
me
swirled
into
rainbow
storms
of
birds
and
insects
that
looked
like
a
cross
between
moths
and
the
leaves
and
tendrils
of
exotic
plants
often
i
saw
myself
floating
above
clouds
and
mountaintops
alongside
bizarrely
animalistic
spiritual
beings
sometimes
the
dmt
would
take
memories
of
experiences
id
had
and
twist
them
into
its
landscapes
or
populate
them
with
animals
and
gods
i
couldnt
open
my
eyes
and
kept
repeating
to
my
friends
that
id
entered
a
visionary
state

at
this
point
more
people
arrived
at
the
house
and
i
escaped
to
my
friends
bedroom
in
order
to
commune
with
the
dmt
in
solitude
i
turned
off
the
lights
laid
down
on
the
bed
put
on
some
headphones
and
listened
to
coils
and
the
ambulance
died
in
his
arms
for
a
while
i
merely
lay
there
wondering
at
the
incredible
beauty
of
the
closed-eye
visuals
suddenly
without
noticing
the
transition
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
spiritual
breakthrough
heres
an
account
i
wrote
immediately
after
the
experience
at
233
in
the
morning
while
the
euphoria
and
perceptual
distortions
were
still
going
strong



\x93at
a
certain
point
in
the
trip
i
realized
that
i
wasnt
an
individual
anymore
there
was
something
else
that
told
me
that
it
was
all
things
all
people
all
identities
it
told
me
that
it
could
wear
our
perceptions
like
masks
it
asked
me
\x93how
could
i
ever
think
of
myself
as
being
separate
from
all
that
manifold
complexity
i
saw
huge
spiraling
churning
rows
of
heads
human
animal
stone\x97and
the
thing
was
chasing
itself
all
through
them
churning
them
up
stirring
up
perceptions
into
people
this
thing
showed
me
made
me
feel
that
my
whole
identity
was
nothing
more
than
an
empty
mask
to
it
unless
it
chose
to
inhabit
that
mask
with
beautiful
complexity

it
then
made
me
feel
that
inside
my
mind
itself
was
so
much
complexity
that
the
complexity
of
those
perceptions
mirrored
made
room
for
etched
in
limned
and
sanctified
all
the
animal
heads
the
dancing
whirling
world
the
prismatic
voids
threatening
to
shatter
human
minds
to
show
them
what
theyre
worth
that
their
most
intimate
contents
are
nothing
more
than
playthings
to
something
much
vaster
it
then
left
me
churning
into
other
waves
of
images
and
patterns
that
the
dmt
had
left
me
with
i
kept
asking
what
are
you
but
it
didnt
answer\x97it
seemed
as
if
it
almost
laughed
at
the
impudence
of
the
question

[later
that
night
i
also
felt
that
inside
my
head
was
an
infinite
number
of
beings
that
the
complexity
of
my
perceptions
and
the
colonial
nature
of
my
own
consciousness
united
me
with
other
beings
as
well
as
separating
me
from
them
it
was
always
a
mistake
to
view
that
complexity
as
a
barrier
rather
than
a
bridge]

also
this
thing
was
asking
me
why
i
denied
the
spiritual
structure
of
material
reality
it
then
showed
me
an
extra
dimension
of
reality
which
was
made
of
interlacing
patterns
uniting
all
beings
this
spiritual
reality
was
supported
by
pillars
of
light
complex
patterns
of
stone
and
animal
heads
and
the
entity
pressed
my
head
into
one
of
these
pillars
and
asked
me
why
i
didnt
believe
and
my
mind
was
flooded
with
interlacing
imagery
i
understood
then
that
i
was
united
with
all
things
these
patterns
these
interlacing
patterns
[the
ones
generated
by
the
dmt]
they
froth
up
the
boundaries
between
entities
and
tangle
them
together



the
heads
were
all
stretched
out
in
a
row
which
curved
as
if
it
were
the
crest
of
a
wave
or
the
slope
of
a
hill
they
seemed
almost
like
graves
or
monuments
the
entity
that
i
encountered
wasnt
itself
visible
i
could
only
glimpse
it
in
the
ripples
it
left
as
it
moved
through
twisting
churning
webs
of
light
i
understood
that
the
complexity
of
the
perceptions
in
me
was
what
united
me
with
all
things
i
was
merely
one
stream
in
an
endlessly
intertwining
river
of
perceptual
streams
i
kept
repeating
to
myself
\x93i
am
many
things
knowing
that
even
in
myself
the
perceptions
of
a
multitude
of
different
entities
were
churning
together
in
a
little
whirlpool
of
a
human
mind
seemed
to
unite
me
with
the
endless
complexity
of
the
universe

the
spiritual
reality
i
witnessed
was
made
of
fractal
patterns
of
animals
and
plants
that
twisted
together
and
interlaced
between
all
objects
both
organic
and
inorganic
it
was
a
huge
warping
prismatic
fabric
that
wove
the
universe
together
certain
parts
of
this
fabric
thickened
into
towering
pillars
shot
through
with
intensely
glowing
bluish
light
it
was
one
of
these
pillars
that
the
entity
held
my
head
against
and
the
zig-zagging
animal
patterns
that
danced
across
it
tangled
together
and
crept
into
my
thoughts
destroying
the
boundaries
between
my
own
identity
and
the
rest
of
the
universe

after
this
point
in
the
trip
i
felt
more
spiritually
energized
than
ever
before
in
my
life
it
was
only
later
in
the
morning
that
i
began
to
worry
id
seen
things
that
no
human
being
had
seen
and
broken
my
head
for
good
always
a
sign
of
a
great
trip
i
decided
to
see
if
i
could
sleep
it
off
and
surprisingly
had
very
little
trouble
getting
to
bed
when
i
woke
up
seven
hours
later
i
was
a
little
foggy
and
disoriented
and
i
had
a
bit
of
a
headache
but
otherwise
i
was
fine
within
24
hours
of
the
experience
i
no
longer
noticed
any
aftereffects
all
in
all
this
was
certainly
the
most
intense
experience
of
my
life
and
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
as
well




this
record
is
an
account
of
my
first
true
breakthrough
experience
with
dimethyltryptamine
extracted
from
mimosa
hostilis
root
bark
aka
jerema

my
first
dmt
extraction
involved
shredding
1
kilogram
of
the
root
bark
in
a
coffee
grinder
which
yielded
an
off
pink-purple
mulch
with
fine
powder
collecting
on
the
bottom

this
material
was
basified
to
12
ph
using
sodium
hydroxide
from
roebics
crystal
drain
cleaner

red
devil
lye
had
been
taken
off
the
market
and
this
was
the
only
available
substitute
i
could
find
roebic
appears
to
now
be
off
the
market
as
well

the
bark
material
was
allowed
to
sit
in
the
solution
for
10
hours

afterward
5
extractions
of
non-polar
mineral
spirits
were
taken
from
the
bark/sodium
hydroxide
solution

a
ratio
of
110
of
mineral
spirits
were
added
to
the
bark
solution
then
shaken
viperously
for
5
minutes

the
two
layers
of
non-polar
and
polar
solvent
solutions
were
left
to
sit
for
30
minutes
to
separate

after
the
solution
was
separated
using
a
turkey
baser
it
was
added
to
a
large
glass
bowl

all
5
extractions
were
completed
in
this
same
procedure

each
extraction
was
added
together
leaving
me
with
roughly
700-800ml
of
dark
yellow
liquid



this
liquid
was
then
added
to
a
1
gallon
bag
and
3-4
times
the
amount
in
water
was
poured
into
it

the
layer
of
non-polar
solvent
was
then
separated
from
the
polar
water
solvent

a
scissor
was
used
to
cut
a
bottom
corner
of
the
bag
to
allow
the
water
layer
to
drain
out

just
as
the
water
finished
draining
the
bag
was
immediately
placed
over
another
glass
bowl
so
the
non-polar
solvent
could
flow
into
it

this
procedure
was
repeated
4
times
to
make
sure
all
sodium
hydroxide
water
soluble
was
removed
from
the
non-polar
solvent

the
yellow
liquid
material
was
then
poured
into
a
large
glass
baking
pan
and
allowed
to
evaporate

after
a
week
or
so
the
solvent
had
completely
evaporated
leaving
an
orange
lucent
wax
substance
which
upon
scraping
up
yielded
a
light
sienna
type
tar

initial
trials
of
smoking
this
substance
resulted
in
a
very
painful
and
unsettling
smoke
using
a
glass
pipe

50
mg
of
so
created
definite
altered
consciousness
perception
and
visual
distortion

however
my
lung
capacity
prevented
me
from
smoking
any
more
of
this
orange
brown
material

i
still
had
4
kilograms
of
mimosa
hostilis
bark
sitting
in
the
freezer

after
my
disappointing
extraction
results
i
dismissed
it
as
a
source
for
crude
dmt

i
figured
the
tar
may
be
a
great
substitute
for
drinking
the
foul
ayahuasca
tea
but
was
not
an
acceptable
source
of
smokeable
dmt

the
irony
being
after
about
1
year
i
was
cleaning
out
my
freezer
and
stumbled
upon
one
2
kilo
bag
of
mimosa
hostilis
bark
and
a
second
bag
of
finely
ground
2
kg
bark

i
had
thought
about
selling
it
or
making
several
ayahuasca
teas
which
ive
never
tried
due
to
certain
medications
im
taking
either
way
i
figured
id
condense
the
solution
down
to
something
more
storage
friendly
or
at
least
make
a
few
bucks
off
of
it

i
then
decided
selling
year
old
mimosa
bark
isnt
fair
to
the
buyer
and
decided
id
do
the
same
extraction
process
i
had
tried
1
year
prior

i
had
gone
through
the
same
exact
series
of
extractions
using
the
polar
and
non-polar
separations
which
i
had
utilized
1
year
earlier

however
i
chose
to
evaporate
the
substance
in
a
different
setting

instead
of
evaporating
outside
i
stuck
the
dishes
in
a
slow
ventilation
area
in
the
garage

i
used
two
baking
glass
dishes
because
i
had
twice
the
mineral
spirit
material
to
work
with

i
basically
left
the
dishes
in
those
cupboards
for
about
two
months

i
should
note
that
during
those
two
months
it
was
the
coldest
time
of
year
between
december
and
february

temperatures
in
the
garage
regularly
experienced
highs
of
50
degrees
and
lows
of
30
degrees



i
had
actually
forgotten
about
the
trays
for
a
month
when
i
went
onto
an
entheogen
forum
and
began
looking
into
tryptamines

this
jolted
my
memory
and
i
remembered
about
the
trays
i
had
forgotten

that
night
i
went
into
the
garage
and
pulled
both
trays
out
of
the
cupboard

to
my
surprise
i
noticed
white
bumps
scattered
throughout
them

they
were
such
a
pure
white
i
almost
mistaken
them
for
some
sort
of
freak
fungal
infection

upon
further
inspection
i
noticed
these
bumps
looked
like
finely
defined
crystalline
structures

there
was
still
liquid
within
the
dishes
so
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
bowl
and
stuck
the
remaining
solution
into
the
freezer
for
48
hours

the
white
crystals
were
stuck
to
the
dishes
there
were
dozens
of
them
on
average
the
size
of
a
penny
to
a
quarter

these
crystal
structures
were
all
circular
and
seemed
to
form
in
separate
clumps


i
scraped
these
up
and
placed
them
on
a
glass
plate
to
dry

in
the
meantime
after
48
hours
i
checked
on
the
glass
bowl
in
the
freezer

upon
pulling
out
the
bowl
i
noticed
an
immediate
fuzzy
film
all
over
the
sides
of
the
bowl
where
the
non-polar
solution
was
present

it
looked
exactly
like
yellow
pollen
with
thousands
of
tiny
yellow
balls
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
dish

the
remaining
liquid
was
poured
out
and
this
material
was
collected
using
a
razor
blade

this
soupy
bright
yellow
material
was
then
placed
on
a
glass
dish
and
allowed
to
dry

the
remaining
liquid
was
placed
back
into
the
glass
dishes
and
allowed
to
evaporate
outside
under
much
faster
circumstances

what
i
ended
up
with
were
three
separate
grades
of
dmt

the
white
crystalline
\x93bumps
as
i
call
them
seemed
to
be
very
pure
dmt

i
didnt
need
a
microscope
to
see
the
complex
arrangements
within
the
material
i
collected

it
turned
out
to
be
several
grams
which
filled
¾
of
a
baggy
which
most
buttons
used
for
clothing
accessories
are
sold
within

my
theory
is
the
slow
evaporation
coupled
with
the
numerous
freezing
nights
seemed
to
concentrate
the
chemical
slowly
over
time

it
gradually
precipitated
out
of
the
solution
and
yielded
the
most
pure
product

the
second
extract
was
the
yellow
powder
which
was
precipitated
out
of
the
freezer
technique

it
was
much
more
consistent
in
its
distribution
over
the
glass
bowl

instead
of
seeing
bumps
of
dmt
i
saw
a
thin
1/8th
inch
layer
of
yellow
\x93pollen
type
substance
coat
the
entire
bowl

this
material
i
should
mention
was
partially
extracted
with
xylene

this
is
supposed
to
extract
yuremamine
or
\x93jungle
dmt

this
material
was
separated
in
the
initial
extraction
phase
to
see
if
this
chemical
would
truly
be
extracted

i
also
used
mineral
spirits
with
a
couple
of
the
pulls

i
saw
no
reddish
or
other
bizarre
colorations
with
the
extract
which
ive
read
have
been
reported

i
do
believe
there
is
some
other
alkaloid
possibly
with
maoi
characteristics
which
makes
the
xylene
extract
more
intense

this
yellow
substance
proved
to
be
a
more
powerful
experience
then
the
pure
crystalline
\x93bumps
i
had
discovered
from
the
initial
solution

the
evaporated
waxy
brown-orange
material
from
the
third
final
extract
seems
to
be
residual
alkaloids
which
contain
some
leftover
dmt

ive
found
it
way
to
hard
to
smoke
and
have
therefore
saved
it
in
the
freezer
as
a
possible
future
ayahuasca
analogue

the
first
dose
of
dmt
i
administered
was
the
initial
crystalline
white
substance
which
i
gave
to
a
co-worker

upon
initial
feedback
he
had
stated
it
was
\x93very
clean
and
visual
but
would
not
comment
further

this
irritated
me
because
i
had
basically
used
him
as
a
guinea
pig
and
these
were
the
only
words
he
could
provide
on
the
experience

ive
noticed
after
repeatedly
smoking
dmt
that
memory
is
quite
fleeting
and
absent

it
seems
as
though
the
brain
cannot
or
does
not
want
to
process
high
doses
of
this
compound

the
mind
seems
to
shut
down
in
an
attempt
to
possibly
retain
any
tangible
essence
of
accessable
reality

i
think
the
experience
itself
might
be
so
profound
the
brain
shuts
itself
off
in
order
to
cope
with
the
effects
which
are
too
intense
for
the
normal
state
of
consciousness
to
bear

it
could
well
be
a
psychological
barrier
which
the
mind
upholds
in
order
to
tolerate
a
rapidly
disintegrating
state
of
both
the
ego
and
the
body

i
vaguely
remember
my
first
experience
with
the
first
crystalline
white
dmt
i
had
smoked

i
remember
up-taking
the
compound
in
around
3
large
tokes
out
of
a
glass
pipe

i
would
estimate
i
smoked
around
60
milligrams
or
so
of
the
substance

i
held
the
lighter
about
1
inch
from
the
pipe
and
let
it
sit
for
10
seconds
or
so

i
then
inhaled
the
vapor
and
repeated
this
practice
three
times
without
ever
exhaling

i
had
held
the
vapor
for
around
40
seconds
over
the
course
of
the
three
hits

i
could
feel
the
effects
after
roughly
20
seconds



by
the
exhalation
of
the
third
hit
i
was
experiencing
an
incredible
glowing
vibration
which
overwhelmed
my
entire
body

it
had
no
reference
point
and
i
felt
as
though
my
entire
body
was
an
integrated
force

the
force
was
emanating
from
the
center
of
my
brain

i
could
simultaneously
experience
every
cell
within
my
body
which
seemed
to
originate
within
the
top
of
my
mind

typing
this
now
completely
sober
i
can
feel
the
pulse
of
the
experience
emanating
from
my
brain

residual
memory
is
my
best
guess

the
imprint
of
the
experience
seems
to
alter
the
ability
to
remember
it

the
only
way
i
can
remember
the
experience
is
to
recount
some
of
its
most
mild
and
subdued
effects

i
think
of
past
life
regression
of
the
consciousness

in
order
to
articulate
such
a
bizarre
experience
into
words
my
brain
must
restore
itself
to
that
point
of
origin

even
then
words
are
completely
inadequate


this
is
what
i
feel
distinguishes
dmt
from
other
psychedelics
of
which
i
have
consumed
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
times

when
i
recall
a
memory
of
an
acid
trip
psilocybin
trip
or
mescaline
trip
they
all
feel
subjective
and
alienated
from
my
mind

they
are
nothing
more
then
remnant
thoughts
proud
but
distant
from
my
current
conscious
state
of
mind

they
are
like
the
alleyway
of
a
distant
exuberant
and
fascinating
exploration
into
an
inner-city
complex
to
which
i
dont
occupy

my
mind
recounts
the
memory
and
experience
but
keeps
it
disconnected
because
it
is
not
integrated
into
my
everyday
existence

these
psychedelics
are
but
a
lone
and
narrow
road
which
my
psyche
may
pursue
every
once
and
awhile
on
whim



dmt
is
a
far
different
beast

it
is
right
there
in
my
thoughts
my
dreams
my
reality

i
feel
it
every
second
im
alive
as
im
typing
this
coursing
through
my
veins

it
is
of
me
and
part
of
me

i
sense
it
has
and
always
will
be
within
me
till
the
day
i
die
and
beyond

i
only
get
this
experience
with
other
tryptamines
or
phenethylamines
when
i
consume
them

they
feel
like
a
temporary
portal
into
the
astral
realms
of
my
subconscious

whenever
i
think
about
dmt
or
even
envision
its
effects
on
my
mind
i
enter
a
sort
of
binding
resonance
with
reality

typing
this
and
thinking
of
this
substance
i
feel
as
though
it
is
effecting
me
now
and
always
has
been

it
is
part
of
the
complex
chemical
soup
of
my
own
pineal
gland

when
i
listen
to
my
body
it
tells
me
what
the
mind
is
too
hypersensitive
to
understand
emotionally
unless
it
cuts
itself
off
from
primal
sensation



the
pineal
gland
is
the
manufacturing
center
for
dmt

it
occupies
the
most
valuable
real-estate
inside
the
brain
around
its
center

my
question
why
did
we
evolve
to
protect
this
gland
and
hold
it
in
the
most
sacred
place
within
the
brain

it
occupies
the
most
substantial
chakra
point
or
crown
chakra

it
is
right
above
the
cerebral
pineal
fluid
sack
which
surrounds
the
human
brain

this
suggests
it
is
in
direct
proximity
to
upload
information
of
possible
visual
and
psychic
nature
into
this
organ

the
ancient
sumerians
were
aware
of
this
gland
along
with
the
french
philosopher
descrates
and
the
egyptians

many
of
the
ancients
inscriptions
and
cuneiforms
show
what
looks
like
a
pinecone
adorning
scepters
and
other
religious
and
sacred
objects

they
understood
the
pinecone
pineal
gland
was
the
vessel
into
incredible
spiritual
revelations
and
knowledge

reality
is
nothing
more
then
concentrated
energy
condensed
down
to
a
specific
3rd
dimensional
vibration
at
an
extremely
slow
rate

when
i
focus
hard
enough
i
feel
this
vibration
it
is
most
prominent
when
under
altered
states
of
consciousness

under
this
mild
focused
awareness
i
feel
what
my
body
truly
is
and
always
was

surprisingly
it
feels
like
a
weak
dmt
trip
within
a
competent
and
coherent
state
of
mind

a
constant
vibrational
glow
within
my
physical
body
at
probably
slightly
above
my
heart
rate

this
beat
probably
corresponds
with
the
shumman
frequency

my
body
beats
at
the
same
resonance
as
the
earths

i
feel
this
when
im
having
deep
thoughts
about
my
experiences
with
dmt
under
extreme
meditation

when
i
imagine
its
presence
over
my
psyche
then
i
begin
to
feel
the
greater
sense
that
i
am
just
a
beat
or
pulse
within
a
greater
planetary
organism

the
feeling
is
so
completely
organic
and
fluid
i
almost
have
panic
attacks
at
times

as
though
my
heart
is
beating
rhythmically
with
a
force
out
of
my
control

this
pales
in
comparison
to
the
yellow
powdered
freezer
precipitated
dmt
i
smoked

that
experience
was
much
more
profound
and
terrifying

the
irony
being
the
terror
tantalized
me
making
me
titillated
and
disturbed

the
substantial
thing
is
i
remember
every
single
aspect
in
specific
detail

it
is
more
vivid
then
my
most
vivid
memories
of
my
entire
27
years
of
life
on
this
planet

my
first
sexual
encounter
my
childhood
trauma
of
being
lost
in
disneyland
anaheim
ca
for
12
hours
terrorized
by
costumed
mickey
mouse
and
goofy
and
even
my
first
experience
waking
up
from
a
2
day
coma
of
ghb
overdose
which
i
recovered
from
after
my
vitals
flat
lined

the
experience
i
had
is
the
most
vivid
memory
i
have
ever
had
in
my
entire
life

it
is
more
real
then
this
reality

so
pristine
in
all
aspects
i
know
it
was
real

not
of
this
dimension
within
that
plane
but
of
another
higher
4th
dimensional
place



this
place
was
so
vivid
i
know
without
a
doubt
it
could
not
have
been
a
hallucination
or
vision
unless
the
very
nature
of
the
reality
i
have
spent
my
entire
life
is
a
perpetual
hallucination
or
vision

this
current
and
physical
reality
feels
more
synthetic
then
the
chemically
intertwined
oneness
dmt
took
me
into
within
5
minutes

in
that
span
of
time
i
entered
a
plane
of
space
which
was
so
foreign
and
alien
to
my
existence
it
destroyed
my
faith
in
the
very
material
existence
of
this
reality

it
also
had
detrimental
consequences
on
my
belief
in
death
and
birth
which
at
that
time
simultaneously
occurred
in
the
same
space



this
showed
me
there
is
no
birth
and
no
death

it
is
the
illusion
of
this
subjective
perception
of
the
whole
consciousness
creating
a
new
memory
for
itself

think
about
any
memory
youve
ever
had
it
starts
and
it
ends
very
abruptly
after
only
a
mater
of
seconds

this
is
the
microcosm
of
a
fleeting
experience
juxtaposed
onto
the
greater
movie
which
is
the
story
of
your
life

all
we
see
is
the
movie
in
action
were
never
aware
of
what
happens
before
or
afterward
in
this
realm

we
dont
anticipate
the
planning
the
script
being
written
the
actors
being
cast

we
dont
foreshadow
the
credits
role
because
we
simply
turn
off
the
tv
prior

we
dont
ask
why
the
set
is
disassembled
the
costumes
auctioned
off
the
copyrights
challenged
in
court

we
only
see
the
parts
that
we
want
to
see

these
parts
are
recorded
in
a
montage
fashion
over
the
span
and
course
of
our
waking
reality



that
description
is
the
difference
between
this
reality
and
the
reality
of
dmt

it
shows
me
the
past
present
and
future
simultaneously
in
one
conscious
state

this
is
about
the
simplest
way
i
can
articulate
what
i
think
this
compound
does
and
is
capable
of
on
the
mind

transporting
consciousness
to
a
state
of
\x93omnipresence
which
our
primal
brain
is
simply
too
preoccupied
with
the
present
to
assimilate

i
dont
want
to
provide
the
impression
that
im
enlightened
or
endowed
with
esoteric
knowledge
the
general
populace
is
lacking
because
im
not

im
a
polysubstance
abuser
an
alcoholic
suffer
from
adhd
and
chronic
depression

i
am
far
from
enlightened

and
that
is
the
magic
of
dmt

i
dont
have
to
be
endowed
with
talents
beyond
the
normal
scope
of
humanity

i
dont
need
to
have
mastered
ayuradic
or
vedic
forms
of
meditation

i
care
little
for
puloty
or
yoga

i
tried
them
but
i
simply
found
i
love
to
endure
pain


i
have
always
been
attracted
to
bodybuilding

a
great
euphemism
for
life

i
destroy
my
body
only
to
build
it
up
stronger
then
it
was
before

i
love
pain
because
i
feel
that
through
this
venue
only
there
can
i
grow

the
roman
empires
debouched
hedonism
has
shown
the
excesses
of
pleasure
leads
to
spiritual
downfall

dmt
is
a
painful
experience
in
very
high
doses

it
or
any
other
psychedelics
are
not
meant
for
most
of
the
population
as
huxley
warned

leary
made
the
mistake
of
hoping
the
greater
populace
would
see
some
relevance
to
these
substances
without
understanding
humanity
has
an
innate
and
outright
detesting
of
the
unknown



dmt
is
the
ultimate
unknown
and
perhaps
understandably
the
most
cautious
psychedelic
which
one
should
approach

in
many
respects
i
am
glad
this
substance
is
scheduled
because
i
do
not
feel
most
of
humanity
is
ready
to
allow
their
brain
to
accept
an
experience
so
outside
of
their
immediate
surroundings

the
majority
of
humanity
is
simply
not
ready
for
this
experience

this
is
why
i
feel
it
must
be
left
in
the
hands
of
the
brave
and
adventurous
beings
who
are
willing
to
risk
their
own
sanity
in
order
to
explore
the
ultimate
unknown
the
human
brain


i
prefer
huxleys
mentality
in
that
psychedelics
should
be
reserved
for
a
select
few
but
who
decides
that
curriculum
standard
and
access

i
believe
these
few
discover
this
on
their
own
because
something
has
always
driven
them
to
this
information

they
have
always
known
these
entheogens
were
meant
to
lead
them
to
something
beyond
themselves

this
is
precisely
why
i
am
here
typing
this
information
for
you
to
read

the
curiosity
which
has
brought
you
to
this
information
is
a
testiment
to
your
willingness
to
attempt
to
understand
these
alternate
realities

the
other
route
is
leary
whos
blatant
publication
of
this
alternative
psychatropic
medication
helped
inhibit
psychiatric
research
of
entheogens
back
by
decades

advocating
mass
use
of
such
powerful
tools
is
incredibly
foolish
and
i
find
premature
coming
from
an
md
who
was
caught
up
in
the
wave
of
popularity
he
had
received
from
his
association
with
these
compounds



his
ego
destroyed
psychedelics
in
mainstream
research
this
is
why
they
are
chemically
designed
to
destroy
the
ego

to
prevent
mass
human
awareness
of
their
eye
opening
properties

from
personal
observation
most
of
us
are
not
physiologically
hardwired
or
capable
to
cope
with
the
changes
these
substances
induce


i
theorize
these
plant
alkaloid
compositions
are
a
deterrent
to
animals
developing
higher
organized
states

in
these
states
these
animals
possessed
greater
potential
to
destroy
the
plant
in
question

keep
the
animal
disoriented
and
confused
and
it
will
not
desire
to
pass
this
information
to
its
siblings

alkaloids
are
a
defense
mechanism
simultaneously
terrifying
and
expanding
reality

to
most
animals
this
would
be
perceived
as
a
toxin
within
the
brain
with
no
benefit
to
their
immediate
survival

hence
the
plant
is
saved
from
being
eaten
and
preserves
itself
in
order
to
reproduce

why
then
do
humans
consciously
consume
the
toxic
plants
other
animals
disregard

the
more
one
advocates
and
ordains
these
chemical
godheads
the
more
it
fuels
the
ego

this
is
most
prevelant
in
western
society
where
such
chemicals
give
the
distributor
a
sense
of
superiority
by
having
access
to
a
divine
substance
which
only
a
few
are
granted

this
is
the
trick
organized
religion
has
used
for
thousands
of
years

its
controllers
profess
to
contain
a
knowledge
and
wisdom
from
an
external
source
usually
god
which
gives
these
priests
bishops
and
shamans
spiritual
control
over
the
population



yes
primitive
shamans
are
just
a
prototype
of
bishops
priests
and
disciples
which
western
society
adopted
without
the
heavy
cultural
indoctrination
of
psychedelic
compounds

shamans
along
with
priests
and
religious
leaders
fall
into
the
trap
of
ego

this
is
why
i
feel
these
plants
place
a
premium
on
debilitating
that
aspect
of
the
human
mind

the
ego
is
what
influences
these
teachers
to
withhold
the
knowledge
and
horde
it
for
themselves

they
pass
it
down
selectively
to
only
a
few
who
they
feel
worthy
enough
to
possess
it

this
is
the
ego
in
motion

these
elitists
are
revered
and
worshiped
for
this
wisdom
and
held
in
elevated
status

they
use
these
substances
to
wow
their
populations

if
one
wishes
to
understand
this
very
simply
then
ask
the
question
\x93who
benefits\x93



when
one
asks
this
question
he/she
will
see
very
clearly
who
has
profited
from
the
circumstances
i
have
described

priests
are
the
updated-shamans
of
the
modern
world

they
are
there
to
impress
their
followers
with
the
possibility
of
access
to
greater
truth
and
knowledge

in
return
they
receive
money
adoration
and
power

as
long
as
they
tightly
hold
onto
this
knowledge
they
have
no
fear
in
it
reaching
the
masses

this
is
the
detriment
the
ego
has
caused
on
our
culture
and
its
access
to
higher
spiritual
truths


these
spiritual
keepers
hold
the
highest
status
and
prestige
of
the
group
they
occupy
containing
knowledge
and
insight
denied
to
the
general
populace

this
is
say
akin
to
the
highest
degrees
of
the
freemasons
who
have
restrained
the
knowledge
of
ancient
levitation
occult
ritual
magic
and
esoteric
wisdom

this
wisdom
held
desperately
because
the
few
in
power
use
the
many
followers
ignorance
to
glorify
and
exonerate
their
status
at
the
expense
of
their
sheeps
lack
of
hindsight

the
wolf
is
always
herding
his
flock
inevitablly
into
slaughter



what
i
find
interesting
about
dmt
is
its
ability
to
completely
shatter
my
sense
of
ego
and
any
feelings
of
superiority
be
it
intellectual
or
physical
i
may
think
i
possess

no
other
entheogen
has
done
this
and
\x93told
me
in
ways
i
dont
understand
that
i
am
not
what
i
think
i
am
or
ever
was

other
chemicals
may
take
me
into
another
dimension
of
reality
but
never
take
me
to
\x93another
reality

this
is
exactly
what
is
happening
to
my
psyche
while
on
dmt
vs
other
entheogens

they
take
my
ego
to
another
plane
where
to
the
outsider
it
seems
limited
but
is
merely
bypassed

dmt
takes
my
ego
to
another
place
so
foreign
and
alien
in
nature
it
ceases
to
exist
in
this
dimension
altogether

such
a
shattering
event
occurs
over
the
course
of
less
then
five
minutes
before
im
back
within
the
place
from
which
i
left



for
reference
purposes
ill
describe
the
only
other
substances
which
has
created
ego
death
to
such
a
drastic
degree
as
dmt

it
is
salvia
divinorum
or
\x93diviners
sage

personally
i
disregard
salvia
and
have
never
found
any
spiritual
or
transcendent
tangible
benefit
from
the
several
times
ive
smoked
it

it
feels
alien
similar
to
dmt
but
not
integrated
into
my
being

it
has
the
same
sterility
and
muteness
feeling
i
get
from
dmt

but
it
lacks
a
sense
of
the
only
word
i
can
describe
as
\x93soul



whereas
dmt
feels
cosmic
and
infinite
salvia
feels
personal
internal
and
entrapping
to
my
consciousnesses
point
of
reference

the
intensity
and
duration
of
dmt
and
salvia
are
both
startlingly
similar

both
begin
within
20-30
seconds
and
effects
end
completely
within
15
minutes

both
are
profound
and
easily
the
two
most
intense
experiences
ive
ever
had
in
my
life

they
seem
to
replicate
the
same
alien
plane
of
existence
however
the
effects
are
drastically
different
from
one
another



at
1
minute
into
both
experiences
i
loose
complete
control
over
my
body
time
has
no
meaning
or
ever
did

i
could
be
dead
or
living
and
it
wouldnt
mater
because
those
states
of
being
hold
no
real
effect
over
the
conscious
state
which
my
mind
is
occupying

i
believe
it
is
this
point
my
consciousness
has
left
3rd
dimensional
dense
space
and
accessed
a
lighter
4th
dimensional
realm

here
anything
goes
and
nothing
in
the
context
of
this
3rd
dimensional
space
holds
any
relevance

its
gone
there
is
no
physical
body
as
there
is
no
need
for
one

consciousness
doesnt
seem
to
need
a
body

in
this
state
the
body
was
merely
a
vessel
to
experience
the
consciousness
which
was
always
pervasive
in
all
things





this
is
right
where
the
similarities
completely
end

dmt
connects
me
with
an
all
encompassing
force
which
is
present
in
all
mater
within
the
universe

i
am
one
with
the
infinite
the
cosmic
consciousness
of
a
dozen
different
dimensions
which
all
exist
simultaneously

the
salvia
experience
is
most
similar
to
a
blackout
of
my
consciousness

i
go
deep
within
my
most
primordial
state

my
mind
is
not
able
to
articulate
any
point
of
reference
to
this
reality
yet
all
of
my
motor
skills
are
fully
intact

i
know
this
happens
to
most
people
that
smoke
salvia
because
ive
watched
hundreds
of
videos
of
kids
trying
it
on
youtube

about
30
seconds
in
i
can
see
the
point
where
these
people
stop
laughing
and
hit
that
alternate
reality

in
this
state
they
cannot
express
it
but
they
are
usually
terrified
confused
and
gripped
with
emotion
which
the
body
cannot
and
doesnt
externally
demonstrate
to
the
observer

i
believe
much
of
this
has
to
due
with
setting
as
salvia
is
often
a
first
and
only
time
occurrence
due
to
the
experience
it
generates



what
i
find
unsettling
about
salvia
is
it
seems
to
take
any
remnant
of
whatever
consciousness
i
can
make
reference
of
and
\x93unzip
it

my
mind
is
torn
in
two
separate
places
as
the
drug
takes
it
in
one
direction
but
my
mind
wants
to
go
in
the
other

its
an
utter
contradiction
of
planes
of
my
psyche

i
call
it
the
\x93zipper
effect

i
am
unzipped
and
splitting
apart
being
pulled
instantly
in
two
separate
directions
without
any
control

i
wouldnt
mind
this
state
of
being
if
i
felt
as
though
i
somehow
benefited
from
it
or
utilized
it

maybe
it
is
just
me
but
i
can
never
seem
to
feel
as
though
this
introspective
substance
is
connecting
me
to
anything
meaningful
or
psychologically
usable


i
believe
salvia
and
dmt
are
accessing
the
same
dimensional
space

the
salvia
taking
me
to
an
infinite
introspective
collapse
of
the
ego
and
reality
where
i
am
self
contained

the
dmt
taking
me
to
infinite
cosmic
possibility
where
i
am
integrated
into
all
matter
and
am
all
mater
within
the
universe
simultaneously

the
micro
and
the
macro
expressing
themselves
in
different
conscious
states
yet
always
of
the
same
source


i
think
my
primitive
mammalian
brain
is
more
attracted
to
the
dmt
because
of
its
constant
role
in
human
metabolism
and
biological
function

the
brain
craves
this
substance
which
interestingly
is
one
of
the
only
to
be
up-taken
so
readily
by
the
cerebral
pineal
fluid
of
the
blood
brain
barrier

much
more
easily
then
complex
carbohydrates
or
proteins
which
must
be
broken
down
into
glucose
for
the
brain
to
utilize
their
properties


salvia
is
not
an
alkaloid
and
is
not
as
easily
recognizable
by
the
human
body

this
is
why
i
believe
i
have
a
dislike
of
the
substance

my
brain
seems
to
utilize
dmt
because
it
knows
through
millions
of
years
of
evolution
how
to
best
incorporate
it
into
my
mind
and
body

the
salvia
is
foreign
and
new
a
novelty

perhaps
through
the
same
evolutionary
process
it
too
will
generate
the
\x93missing
link
to
the
subconscious

i
theorize
the
human
brain
isnt
yet
fully
integrated
within
the
individuality
of
conscious
thought
it
occupies
to
understand
the
extreme
interpersonal
plane
salvia
invokes

we
are
social
animals
bound
and
interconnected
with
other
members
of
our
species

we
have
never
been
alone
isolated
and
ostracized
to
the
point
where
one
can
evolve
long
enough
to
deprive
itself
of
the
collective
heard

it
is
impossible
to
understand
conscious
singularity
because
as
social
primates
we
will
always
depend
on
other
animals
of
the
same
species
in
order
to
survive

this
is
why
i
feel
salvia
is
inaccessible
in
the
current
human
state

were
not
quite
ready
to
leave
any
and
all
reference
or
attachment
to
the
collective
consciousness
which
binds
all
of
us
together

we
are
essentially
a
borg
mind
100th
monkey
effect
in
full
force
and
always
have
been
to
further
the
evolution
of
our
species

our
planet
is
within
its
current
state
of
disarray
chaos
and
schizogenesis
due
to
the
collective
state
humanity
has
created

the
dmt
is
the
embodiment
of
collective
consciousness

it
destroys
my
ego
so
that
i
can
see
the
destruction
my
ego
has
caused
upon
myself
and
others



it
is
built
in
hardware
within
the
human
pineal
gland
tissue
and
blood

designed
for
what
i
feel
is
to
destroy
ego
and
connect
us
in
a
state
of
being
where
we
are
not
influenced
by
crude
emotional
states
cultural
biases
and
petty
selfish
gains

this
is
why
i
believe
the
drug
is
so
sterile
and
neutral
in
nature

it
doesnt
sugar
coat
things
with
an
amphetamine
high
like
the
phethylamine
mescaline

nor
does
it
dilute
and
denigrate
the
nervous
system
as
does
the
debilitating
effects
of
alcohol

in
the
end
this
stuff
is
a
conduit
into
\x93god
consciousness

the
irony
being
that
state
has
always
been
here
always
was
here
always
will
be
here

we
are
simply
too
preoccupied
with
our
miniscule
and
trivial
pursuits
to
acknowledge
it

we
are
the
ones
we
were
waiting
for

im
using
salvia
as
a
reference
material
because
it
is
far
more
prevalent
and
accessible
in
its
current
legal
state
then
dmt

more
readers
then
not
have
probably
encountered
salvia
but
not
dmt
therefore
i
felt
a
description
of
its
similarity
to
dmt
may
familiarize
one
with
what
they
may
possibly
expect
from
dmt
in
terms
of
magnitude
duration
and
intensity

at
this
point
i
should
discuss
the
breakthrough
experience
i
had

i
have
no
recollection
of
the
day
or
time
of
this
event

those
facts
feel
irrelevant
to
what
i
encountered
during
that
brief
10
minute
period

i
wish
i
could
accurately
provide
a
date
and
time
in
order
to
sequentially
document
this
event
more
accurately

for
myself
the
experience
is
so
profound
and
overwhelming
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
collect
my
thoughts
into
a
cohesive
state
shortly
after
the
event
had
subsided

i
need
months
to
process
the
experience
and
gather
innate
data
which
the
dmt
is
feeding
my
body

i
can
feel
minimal
amounts
of
dmt
activating
throughout
my
body
at
this
moment

the
memory
of
the
intense
experience
lingers

it
never
leaves
the
back
of
my
mind

it
doesnt
feel
proper
to
attempt
to
define
the
most
profound
experience
of
my
life
within
hours
of
when
it
happened

from
a
scientific
standpoint
this
is
the
most
relevant
approach
to
documenting
the
effects
of
dmt

from
a
physiological
and
psychological
standpoint
its
very
premature
and
the
experience
is
shortchanged
by
the
immediate
effects
vs
the
longer
standing
repercussions

i
feel
as
though
i
am
denying
myself
and
others
the
full
magnitude
of
the
dmt
experience
by
pigeon
holing
it
down
to
a
time
and
place

this
feels
irrelevant
in
the
greater
scheme
of
the
chemical
and
its
role
within
the
human
body

it
is
always
with
me
and
always
will
be
with
me

what
i
chronicle
is
merely
a
peak
release
of
this
compound
which
i
have
coordinated
in
order
for
it
to
direct
me
to
a
state
of
consciousness
i
need
at
that
time
and
space



i
dont
smoke
dmt
on
a
whim
it
tells
my
body
and
my
brain
when
i
\x93need
to
smoke
it

i
dont
feel
as
though
i
control
when
how
or
why
i
need
to
smoke
an
incredibly
powerful
disturbing
and
outright
shattering
experience

in
fact
most
of
my
very
neutral
dmt
experiences
are
bordering
on
unpleasant

the
realm
i
am
taken
to
is
so
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
and
imagination
of
my
conscious
brain
it
is
down
right
terrifying
yet
complete
nirvana
at
the
same
simultaneous
moment

such
a
foreign
place
is
not
dared
treaded
upon
without
a
degree
of
psychological
preparation

this
is
why
salvia
is
usually
a
\x93one
hit
wonder
for
most
people

they
cannot
fathom
the
place
assimilate
it
and
interpret
it
with
their
current
conscious
state
without
deep
preparation
and
forewarning

going
from
\x93here
to
\x93there
in
20
seconds
is
too
much
for
most
people
and
they
will
instinctively
resist
rather
then
embrace
and
let
themselves
go
into
this
experience

so
onto
the
trip
or
whatever
one
wants
to
call
it

it
was
no
trip
i
hate
that
term
yet
it
is
so
accessible
and
immediately
identifiable
i
need
to
use
it
to
create
a
reference
point

it
was
a
journey

a
trip
is
short
and
ends
abruptly
in
the
schism
of
the
relevance
of
time

a
trip
could
be
1
hour
or
20
hours

every
other
psychedelic
experience
ive
used
is
a
\x93trip
because
of
these
traits

dmt
is
not
a
trip
but
a
journey

it
lasts
less
then
any
other
entheogen
ive
ever
encountered
but
takes
me
to
a
place
through
a
cosmic
forest
of
thoughts
and
ideas
over
the
longest
duration
i
can
fathom

i
go
to
a
timeless
place
without
any
reference
to
any
time
or
physical
sensation

i
dont
exist
i
am
merely
consciousness
expressing
itself
in
the
most
primal
state
identifiable
by
the
brains
ability
to
detect
it

what
i
recall
is
the
recollection
of
a
meaningless
night
time
and
place

it
is
to
the
best
of
my
memory
and
ability
the
account
of
the
dmt
experience
i
had
that
night

the
settings
were
familiar
and
felt
completely
reassuring
within
my
surroundings

there
was
no
sense
of
fear
or
hesitation
within
this
\x93chemical
being
for
which
i
was
about
to
envelope

i
loaded
around
60-80
milligrams
of
the
yellowish
dmt
extract
which
was
partially
obtained
using
xylene

ive
heard
this
substance
extracts
a
form
of
dmt
which
is
very
negative
in
nature

i
dont
feel
that
sense

it
has
more
to
do
with
the
situation
setting
and
expectations
then
the
actual
chemical
makeup
which
is
simply
a
byproduct
of
the
experience
itself
as
a
precursor
which
is
only
realized
after
the
entire
experience
has
occurred

after
the
substance
was
loaded
into
the
glass
pipe
i
took
a
blow
torch
and
held
it
roughly
two
inches
away
from
the
glass
pipe

i
lit
the
flame
then
slowly
let
the
spiraling
smoke
swirl
around
within
the
glass
pipe

i
used
my
index
finger
to
close
off
the
top
chamber
hole
to
allow
the
smoke
to
concentrate

after
around
30
seconds
i
began
to
slowly
inhale
the
substance
into
my
lungs

during
this
entire
time
the
lighter
was
continually
burning
and
the
substance
was
continually
vaporizing
into
smoke

within
one
long
30
second
hit
i
managed
to
consume
the
entire
amount
of
dmt

it
was
held
in
my
lungs
for
another
30
seconds
or
so
before
i
exhaled

before
i
let
the
chemical
out
of
my
lungs
i
began
to
feel
the
effects

an
immediate
sense
of
disorientation
clouded
my
conscious
state

i
was
instantly
inundated
with
thoughts
of
panic
and
anxiety

this
feeling
seemed
to
be
a
natural
response
to
the
profound
changes
which
were
rapidly
organizing
within
my
peripheral
view



before
i
could
think
another
thought
my
brain
was
blasted
with
intense
clarity

rich
reds
and
warm
spectrum
colors
exploded
into
my
view

i
saw
all
matter
as
nothing
more
then
an
atomic
\x93reddish
field
of
wild
vibration
which
was
pulsing
within
everything
that
my
eyes
could
absorb

reality
was
a
vibrating
pulsation
of
\x93bead
type
atoms
almost
like
the
static
on
a
channel-less
television
screen

i
saw
everything
for
what
it
truly
was

everything
in
mater
became
nothing
more
then
a
pulsing
vibrating
collection
of
trillions
of
circles
making
up
this
reality

reality
became
an
illusion
as
though
my
body
felt
distanced
from
any
reference
to
it

reality
was
just
a
pulse
within
the
cosmic
vibration
of
the
infinite
cosmic
consciousness

i
was
that
cosmic
consciousness
and
it
began
to
dissolve
my
physical
body
and
ego
simultaneously

i
felt
the
disillusion
from
my
body
was
necessary
to
provide
my
consciousness
with
the
capacity
to
enter
hyper
dimensional
space

i
was
beginning
to
loose
the
ability
to
control
my
arms
and
legs

they
felt
like
silly
putty
as
they
squirmed
around
like
an
octopus
recoiling
while
trying
to
reassure
itself
that
it
still
possessed
the
instinctual
ability
to
move

an
immediate
detachment
of
my
body
was
stirring
within
my
mind

it
wanted
to
keep
itself
aligned
with
anything
with
which
it
could
recognize
but
it
could
not

i
wanted
to
stay
in
the
locality
within
my
physical
body

when
i
say
\x93i
what
i
mean
is
the
consciousness
that
expresses
itself
within
my
body

leaving
this
\x93hive
consciousness
which
my
brain
had
been
so
accustomed
to
was
frightening

at
this
point
\x93i
was
catapulted
out
of
this
reality
and
dimensional
plane

there
was
a
simultaneous
blackout
which
probably
lasted
more
then
a
split
second
in
real
time

it
felt
as
though
it
had
occurred
over
several
minutes

the
events
above
happened
over
what
i
would
guess
were
30
seconds
to
1
minute

immediately
\x93i
was
now
in
a
new
hive
mind
which
felt
more
real
then
anything
ive
ever
felt
in
this
reality

my
vocabulary
and
articulation
are
obviously
severely
lacking
to
accurately
describe
the
next
transpiring
of
events

i
cannot
verbalize
it
using
any
vocabulary
known

no
word
can
provide
or
define
what
i
went
through

i
will
say
it
was
the
most
real
experience
ive
ever
had
in
my
entire
27
years
of
conscious
thought

the
reason
being
none
of
it
was
verbal

everything
was
visual
all
communication
visual
all
thought
visual

everything
was
visual
as
it
felt
to
be
the
most
efficient
and
least
misinterpreted
means
of
experience
and
communication
in
this
place

i
now
know
why
millions
of
people
have
extraterrestrial
abductions

i
know
for
a
fact
many
of
these
people
are
having
these
abductions

the
thing
is
their
body
never
leaves
this
reality
in
order
to
have
those
experiences

their
consciousness
is
being
absorbed
by
extradimensional
beings

im
not
talking
terence
mckenna
style
jeweled
elves
bumping
around
squeamishly

the
beings
that
i
contacted
were
far
more
earnest
sterile
and
objective

to
such
a
degree
they
are
the
embodiment
of
science
in
its
physical
manifestation
of
laws
discourse
control
and
theoretical
ideology

i
was
a
lab
rat
on
a
silver
luminous
table
observed
by
these
completely
neutral
beings

basically
i
had
been
transported
from
my
physical
3rd
dimensional
body
and
simultaneously
placed
into
a
bizarre
4th
dimensional
headspace



i
had
no
body
in
this
realm

i
was
an
etheric
being
lying
down
on
a
table

my
body
was
translucent
as
if
a
form
of
penetrating
light
through
the
skin
displaying
every
skeletal
structure
blood
vessel
and
cell
within
my
body

this
was
all
light
illuminating
itself
and
manifesting
into
what
my
detached
brain
must
have
generated
as
a
holographic
human
body

my
brain
was
still
there
it
was
simply
connected
to
another
place
through
the
dmt
molecule

this
connection
of
an
unidentifiable
alien
state
is
the
source
for
such
confusion
which
my
brain
could
not
clarify
into
anything
remotely
recognizable

i
specifically
remember
these
3
beings
as
though
i
was
looking
at
them
before
this
computer
screen

it
is
as
if
they
are
a
part
of
me
a
part
i
dont
understand
or
can
connect
with
because
they
occupy
a
place
i
cannot
normally
feel
see
or
detect

i
felt
so
trapped
at
this
point

\x93how
on
earth
are
these
beings
here
around
me
and
everyone
else
and
nobody
has
any
sense
of
their
presence

what
im
guessing
is
these
beings
are
operating
on
a
different
frequency
then
our
own

weve
got
hundreds
of
radio
stations
penetrating
the
sky
but
only
hear
one
station
at
a
time

dmt
is
like
an
antenna
which
attracts
other
dimensions
and
draws
them
to
this
one

thus
allowing
the
individual
to
access
and
\x93tune
in
to
these
frequencies
which
were
otherwise
scrambled
and
not
able
to
be
processed
by
the
brain

these
beings
spoke
to
me
telepathically

when
i
state
telepathic
i
mean
whatever
they
wanted
me
to
know
they
\x93gave
it
to
me

it
wasnt
like
a
beam
or
thought
within
the
mind

i
simply
knew
what
they
wanted
me
to
know
without
seeing
or
thinking
anything

it
was
an
emotional
state
in
which
i
could
feel
what
they
wanted
to
tell
me

through
their
instant
transmission
i
knew
exactly
what
they
wanted
and
required
of
me

it
was
so
much
more
efficient
and
straightforward
then
verbal
communication

feeling
evoked
immediate
internal
communication
and
knowledge

i
simultaneously
knew
what
who
and
why
they
and
i
were
there

they
directed
\x93thoughts
through
feelings
into
my
mind
which
i
immediately
recognized

this
didnt
require
any
philosophical
or
intellectual
decoding
or
interpretation

i
simply
knew
exactly
what
they
were
thinking
because
they
could
somehow
transfer
their
intentions
through
imagery
which
i
couldnt
see
but
directly
felt

i
remember
exactly
to
the
very
finest
detail
what
these
beings
looked
like
in
physicality

the
environment
itself
felt
like
something
straight
out
of
ridley
scotts
alien

there
was
a
bizarre
static
type
environment
with
predominate
browns
blacks
and
grays

it
felt
very
organic
with
interconnecting
insectoid
coils
and
wormlike
tubing
networks
lining
the
walls
and
background

it
seemed
to
be
a
ship
or
interstellar
vessel

i
was
in
a
circular
room
which
was
occupied
by
three
beings
which
were
standing
in
front
of
me


they
were
overlooking
my
etheric
body
which
was
laid
upright
onto
a
silver
elongated
slab

these
entities
were
very
skinny

their
body
i
recall
vaguely
because
i
was
too
preoccupied
with
their
face

it
was
blackish
is
if
they
were
all
wearing
a
black
jumpsuit
or
covering

the
face
was
the
most
disturbing
aspect

all
three
had
grey
metallic
faces

these
were
nothing
like
the
zeta-reticluan
alien
grays
with
large
black
almond
eyes
many
people
describe

although
i
could
see
how
the
two
entities
could
be
mistaken
by
a
person
in
such
a
frightened
state

their
face
was
smooth
grey
and
metallic

they
had
no
eyes
ears
or
mouth

the
face
was
one
complete
solid
vessel

i
felt
as
though
it
was
a
mask
of
some
type

it
was
as
if
they
were
using
a
certain
costume
and
mask
in
which
i
could
identify
while
denying
their
true
nature
from
my
vision

their
metallic
mask
had
subtle
features
imprinted
within
it

there
were
what
appeared
residual
elements
of
a
stubby
nose
the
inlay
of
what
was
once
eyes
and
small
slits
which
resembled
babies
lips

i
felt
as
though
these
beings
had
evolved
so
drastically
they
no
longer
had
need
for
the
five
senses

they
no
longer
needed
eyes
ears
lips
etc
to
express
themselves

they
were
expression
personified
in
my
own
thought
of
what
i
visualized
they
were
physically

everything
they
did
or
said
was
by
vibration
and
emotion
in
the
only
way
i
could
seem
to
understand
it

they
were
the
grays
as
many
people
have
described

but
they
were
not
aliens
and
they
were
not
insectoid

these
elements
were
simply
infused
into
the
environment
which
gave
the
impression
that
these
beings
possessed
those
traits

these
beings
\x93were
me
in
a
different
space
and
a
different
dimension

the
alien
nature
of
the
circumstances
initially
prevented
me
from
realizing
this

i
felt
as
though
i
was
from
one
radio
station
and
they
from
another

the
dmt
therefore
must
be
the
antenna
connecting
different
aspects
of
the
same
consciousness

these
stations
can
communicate
by
crossing
paths
and
sharing
data
from
different
dimensional
frequencies

this
may
sound
delusional
but
this
reality
we
live
within
is
the
true
delusion



the
matrix
is
real
but
our
bodies
are
being
used
as
a
vessel
to
experience
3rd
dimensional
space

this
3rd
dimensional
information
is
then
uploaded
by
other
dimensional
beings
who
cannot
experience
this
one

i
only
know
this
because
the
dmt
told
me
and
quite
blatantly
showed
me
how
this
process
works

before
my
trips
with
dmt
i
would
have
thought
this
information
was
coming
from
a
psychotic
schizophrenic

i
now
know
better

i
remember
what
they
had
constantly
expressed
almost
a
dozen
times
over
the
course
of
the
\x93consolidation
process

i
say
consolidation
because
these
beings
\x93were
me
in
another
dimension

they
cared
not
for
how
i
got
there
or
why
i
was
there

they
simply
knew
i
was
coming
and
anticipated
my
arrival

it
is
as
if
they
were
a
more
advanced
part
of
myself
which
i
was
completely
ignorant
of
knowing



i
was
them
and
they
were
me

i
was
like
the
reptilian
brain
that
they
were
studying
from
the
distant
recesses
of
there
own

they
were
like
the
more
evolved
neo-cortex
attempting
to
understand
the
lizard
brain

i
believe
this
alternative
realm
feels
very
reptilian
and
insectoid
in
nature

it
feels
this
way
because
we
are
accessing
a
dimension
which
displays
the
information
these
beings
wish
to
\x93take
from
us

they
appear
this
way
look
this
way
and
behave
in
this
way

they
need
to
acquire
this
reptilian
form
in
order
to
access
the
information
they
take
from
our
psyche

they
are
visible
as
a
mirror
reflection
of
what
they
are
seeking

just
as
i
am
accessing
a
mirror
reflection
of
the
higher
dimensional
state
which
i
am
seeking

this
knowledge
transphere
feels
like
the
way
in
which
they
can
\x93de-evolve
to
become
like
me
and
i
can
\x93evolve
to
become
like
them

it
is
as
if
they
and
i
are
both
assimilating
and
experiencing
a
distant
past
and
future
of
ourselves
simultaneously
in
order
to
better
integrate
the
two

\x93they
and
\x93i
both
wanted
to
have
a
mutual
exchange

i
felt
as
though
the
trauma
i
experienced
was
far
less
severe
then
what
they
had

i
believe
this
is
why
so
many
people
have
negative
extraterrestrial
experiences

they
feel
as
though
these
beings
are
taking
\x93something
from
them
and
not
returning
it

i
believe
this
is
true
to
an
extent

when
i
was
sitting
in
that
chair
these
beings
\x93downloaded
me



the
matrix
is
completely
real
only
much
more
etheric
and
less
mechanized
then
hollywood
would
have
you
believe

these
three
beings
downloaded
me
took
my
consciousness
and
xeroxed
it
storing
it
into
an
essence
with
which
i
felt
they
could
somehow
benefit
from
this
information
in
the
future

they
copied
my
life
memories
experiences
and
dreams

then
stored
this
information
in
order
to
get
high
from
it
and
experience
it
much
like
i
utilize
dmt
to
get
high

it
is
so
bizarre
yet
true

my
memories
are
a
portal
gateway
from
which
dmt
transmits
them
to
these
beings

they
then
utilize
these
fragments
into
knowledge
in
order
to
get
high
by
assimilating
the
information
the
dmt
is
feeding
them

this
is
the
same
process
occuring
within
me
as
their
knowledge
infuses
itself
into
me

getting
me
high
with
the
same
data
transmitted
in
a
different
dimension
and
state

to
put
it
quite
blatently
it
is
a
spiritual
mind
orgy
of
energy

the
perceived
negativity
i
felt
lies
within
the
fact
that
i
knew
they
took
more
from
me
then
they
gave
to
me

when
i
was
downloaded
i
squirmed
in
my
chair

i
could
feel
an
invisible
force
penetrate
my
body
and
my
mind

this
force
\x93pulled
my
essence
into
a
place
which
appeared
\x93higher
and
less
\x93dense
then
my
own

they
beamed
me
probed
me
and
copied
me
and
yet
i
never
left
the
chair

these
events
all
occured
from
an
invisible
force

there
was
no
beam
me
up
scotty
computer
generated
particles

it
was
all
simultaneous
without
any
visual
sense
of
its
presence

this
experience
was
rapid
because
it
was
happening
on
the
tail
end
of
the
peak
of
the
experience



these
beings
knew
they
did
not
have
much
time
and
i
felt
an
urgency
within
their
discourse

at
the
point
i
was
squirming
i
felt
my
body
again

the
peak
was
weaning
after
the
5
minute
mark

i
then
rapidly
descended
back
into
my
body
as
my
consciousness
began
to
\x93fill
out
the
various
portions
of
it

i
first
felt
my
brain
and
its
awareness
of
the
current
surroundings

this
awareness
then
spread
down
into
the
center
of
my
body
and
proceeded
toward
my
arms
then
legs

i
rapidly
felt
a
decent
back
into
current
consciousness

there
was
no
tunnel
or
white
light
or
anything
of
that
nature

i
was
just
simultaneously
brought
back
to
this
dimensional
state
in
the
same
simultaneous
manner
i
had
left
it


intense
distortions
of
space
and
time
were
present

no
true
hallucinations
after
this
point
were
experienced

in
fact
the
only
true
hallucinations
ive
ever
had
are
under
the
effects
of
dmt

ive
heard
atropine
or
datura
based
alkaloids
can
cause
this
but
this
seems
most
accurately
a
delirium
state
and
not
a
true
alternate
dimensional
plane

after
about
five
to
ten
minutes
of
experiencing
what
i
would
describe
as
a
peak
1000
microgram
acid
type
100
milligram
psilocybin
combo
trip
i
was
back
to
complete
baseline


i
could
describe
the
effects
outside
of
the
peak
but
they
feel
like
any
other
tryptamine
based
hallucinogen
in
high
doses

my
interest
is
in
the
extra-dimensional
states
with
which
the
consciousness
seems
to
direct
itself

if
i
were
to
look
at
myself
from
the
dmt
hyperdimensioanal
state
i
would
be
very
disturbed

the
trauma
of
entering
the
dmt
plane
is
far
less
excruciating
then
leaving
it

this
is
probably
why
many
people
who
experience
a
sublime
heaven-like
near
death
state
dont
want
to
come
back

because
after
experiencing
the
most
brilliant
aspects
of
dmt
hyperspace
this
3rd
dimensional
reality
seems
very
primitive
traumatizing
and
incredibly
unnerving
given
the
atrocities
the
psyche
knows
exist
within
it



i
feel
like
dmt
is
the
reason
i
have
sought
out
alternate
dimensions

i
find
this
current
reality
to
be
a
very
schizophrenic
reality

in
this
place
everything
is
chaotic
wrong
and
wicked
where
the
most
corrupt
and
narcissistic
individuals
make
the
most
money
rule
the
most
territory
and
control
the
greatest
spiritual
knowledge

where
religious
and
shamanic
priests
herd
their
subjects
in
perpetually
mundane
and
spiritually-fetal
existence

where
finance
governs
the
social
interest
of
the
masses
while
disregarding
ethical
integrity
in
the
name
of
personal
profiteering


i
hate
this
place
because
i
know
that
once
im
coming
down
from
dmt
im
back
within
my
own
selfish
corrupt
and
decadent
actions

the
dmt
shows
me
my
deficiencies
in
a
blatantly
neutral
and
simple
fashion

much
like
its
incredibly
simple
chemical
compilation
within
the
human
mind

it
tells
me
that
i
am
part
of
what
has
created
the
very
fabric
of
reality
within
which
i
occupy

instinctually
i
know
this
but
the
dmt
shows
me
this
through
providing
me
with
nirvana
and
then
letting
me
materialize
back
into
this
awefull
place



when
im
back
here
i
become
part
of
the
collective
consciousness
that
is
the
human
race

i
look
at
the
very
state
of
this
reality
i
have
helped
generate

the
very
place
i
occupy
i
have
collectively
created
with
my
fellow
humans

and
for
this
i
am
deeply
disappointed
with
myself
and
others

we
have
so
much
potential
which
has
been
circumvented
by
selfish
interest

humanity
simply
doesnt
care
about
spirituality
anymore

it
doesnt
want
to
have
these
experiences

it
only
wants
what
instantly
impacts
it
for
its
own
physical
gain

what
this
shows
me
is
a
warning
to
the
homo
sapien
species

this
entity
must
learn
to
re-connect
itself
with
the
organic
or
it
is
doomed
to
self-destruction
through
artificially
integrated
expression

this
artificial
expression
is
the
next
step
in
evolution
physically

what
we
will
loose
in
the
process
is
the
very
nature
of
our
organic
soul

it
will
be
lost
among
implants
cybernetic
grafts
and
rfid
integration

this
will
all
happen
because
of
the
ego
and
its
persistance
to
revel
in
its
own
brilliance

my
ultimate
theory
is
that
dmt
is
a
\x93transport
molecule
which
periodically
impacts
a
few
individuals
experiencing
its
profound
revelations

through
it
i
see
who
and
what
i
really
am

it
gives
me
all
the
means
by
which
to
understand
my
higher
spiritual
self

it
is
integral
to
my
being
because
it
governs
the
very
nature
of
my
brains
impulses
on
a
minute
vibration

humanity
must
realize
the
reality
it
occupies
is
nothing
more
then
a
conglomeration
of
individual
consciousness
expressing
itself
on
a
subjective
basis
this
is
the
beauty
of
dmt

what
it
has
told
me
is
that
we
are
all
one

it
displays
itself
in
plants
animals
and
fungi
to
demonstrate
it
is
all
pervasive
and
all
encompassing

this
substance
is
the
binding
force
which
links
all
elements
of
this
reality
together

it
shows
me
i
am
not
the
ultimate
egocentric
being
i
think
i
am

i
am
just
a
piece
of
a
greater
cosmic
brain

i
am
a
thought
within
the
singularity
that
is
god

dmt
is
my
ethereal
connection
to
god
through
a
simplistic
chemical
transportation
outlet



to
summarize
dmt
is
a
portal
into
god
consciousness

an
etheric
highway
grid
were
conscious
thought
ideas
and
wisdom
freely
traverses
in
order
to
better
evolve
the
all
pervasive
essence
which
is
everything

this
is
the
most
simplistic
and
accurate
depiction
i
have
ever
conceived
when
trying
to
attempt
to
understand
who
what
and
where
i
am

this
experience
was
so
profound
i
remember
it
cosmos-second
by
cosmos-second
like
the
instant
i
was
born

the
next
closest
memory
i
have
is
my
first
sexual
encounter
at
17
years
old
which
is
fuzzy
and
only
contains
minute
by
minute
bits
and
pieces

that
is
the
effect
this
experience
had
on
me

i
just
started
reading
rick
strauss
mans
\x93dmt
the
spirit
molecule

it
is
profound
that
western
science
is
starting
to
discover
what
i
feel
dmt
has
been
telling
me
and
guiding
me
toward
since
conception
all
along

this
shows
how
the
patrilineal
religions
which
have
destroyed
and
dominated
western
beliefs
and
conscious
expansion
are
beginning
to
disintegrate

i
have
to
disagree
with
rich
straussman
in
regards
to
referencing
dmt
as
a
spirit
molecule

from
my
experience
it
is
not
a
spirit
molecule

dmt
is
the
\x93transport
molecule

the
spirit
is
and
always
was
there
because
it
is
all
things
in
all
dimensions
simultaneously

dmt
allows
the
subjective
elements
of
spirit
to
enter
physical
form
at
roughly
49
days
after
conception

you
and
i
are
those
subjective
elements
of
the
omnipresence
which
is
all
things
we
come
here
to
experience

at
the
moment
of
death
dmt
allows
for
our
part
of
spirit
to
leave
this
dimension
and
reintegrate
with
the
collective
whole

all
of
the
memory
thoughts
and
life
we
lived
are
brought
with
the
spirit
as
it
adds
to
the
god
consciousness
this
is
evolution

not
on
a
physical
scale
but
on
an
etheric
spiritual
scale

this
report
is
a
tribute
to
what
my
most
startling
dmt
trip
created
within
my
mind

it
shook
me
so
hard
and
swayed
me
so
much
i
know
that
dmt
is
\x93the
doorway
to
god
i
theorize
this
is
why
so
much
of
organized
religion
believes
god
is
with
us
around
us
envelopes
us
and
will
always
be

this
is
dmt
a
portal
or
bridge
way
from
god
to
god
\x93they
to
\x93you
and
\x93i

we
are
all
the
subjective
thoughts
of
the
god
singularity
which
pervades
all
matter
dmt
has
shown
me
this

its
simply
god
hasnt
quite
figured
out
how
to
integrate
its
subjective
thoughts
in
order
to
link
all
of
the
various
dimensions
it
occupies

dmt
is
a
tool
to
help
connect
these
places

this
makes
it
what
i
refer
to
as
a
\x93transport
molecule

found
within
us
outside
of
us
and
beyond
us


i
now
know
this
reality
is
but
a
dream
of
the
divine
being
from
which
my
thoughts
are
registering
in
physical
space

all
of
this
is
a
complete
and
utter
illusion

we
collectively
create
this
illusion
and
we
create
the
very
reality
of
the
illusion
within
which
we
live

if
i
were
to
summarize
everything
i
explained
in
this
report
it
would
come
down
to
this
one
sentence

you
are
the
one
you
have
been
waiting
for

you
are
everything
that
is
and
always
will
make
possible




i
had
just
finished
daniel
pinchbecks
marvelously
weaved
metaphysical
memoir
2012
the
return
of
quetzacoatl
and
after
vicariously
experiencing
all
his
psychedelic
trips
shamanic
rituals
and
cosmic
revelations
i
was
eager
to
take
my
own
psychespiritualdelic
journey
it
had
been
months
since
my
last
trip
so
i
uncovered
my
last
3
tabs
of
lsd
i
had
been
saving
a
very
strong
batch
of
fluff
which
has
given
me
many
wondrous
colorful
experiences
before
i
tried
to
convince
my
friend
z
to
join
me
but
ever
since
she
encountered
demons
deep
within
the
underbelly
of
bostons
charles
river
on
an
lsd
trip
she
has
had
the
fear

even
though
i
consider
myself
a
pretty
experienced
psychonaut
lsd
psilocybin
mescaline
dmt
5-meo-dmt
2c-b
2c-e
2c-i
salvia
mali
ecstasy
plus
all
sorts
of
combinations

i
had
never
experienced
anything
beyond
my
self
any
kind
of
other
presence
whether
for
good
or
for
ill
and
even
though
i
saw
it
terrorize
her
mind
i
could
not
help
but
feel
envy
for
her
experience
because
after
all
the
trips
ive
been
on
i
had
never
had
a
truly
spiritual
or
mystical
experience
the
trip
always
just
seemed
like
something
going
on
in
my
head
so
she
stayed
relatively
sober
while
i
put
a
tiny
white
strip
of
blotter
under
my
tongue

i
spent
the
next
30-45
minutes
sitting
around
smoking
a
bowl
or
two
and
enjoying
that
familiar
curious
anxiety
that
slowly
creeps
over
my
consciousness
as
it
begins
to
expand
we
eventually
left
indoors
got
in
the
car
z
was
driving
and
took
the
dog
to
the
beach
which
was
just
a
few
blocks
away
before
we
even
made
it
to
the
sand
i
was
entranced
by
the
sound
of
the
surf
i
remember
telling
z
that
the
sea
is
a
symphony
i
let
the
waves
wash
my
feet
and
ankles
i
felt
such
a
strong
pull
from
the
ocean
it
felt
so
good
i
considered
going
swimming
but
lacking
a
bathing
suit
my
shorts
instead
weighed
down
with
cigarettes
weed
glass
and
dmt
among
other
things
i
stayed
on
dry
land
z
and
i
wandered
around
a
little
smoked
a
bowl
and
then
she
decided
she
wanted
to
go
while
i
decided
to
stay
i
walked
back
to
the
car
with
her
to
coerce
the
dog
into
the
back
seat
and
then
they
were
gone

i
found
myself
alone
on
the
beach
now
i
could
see
maybe
25
feet
in
front
of
me
before
the
ground
disappeared
into
the
luminescent
haze
of
the
sandy
air
above
it
despite
this
the
stars
still
shone
incredibly
brightly
and
when
i
looked
up
at
them
they
danced
and
twinkled
forming
some
kind
of
geometric
net
that
resembled
the
appearance
of
a
canyon
from
directly
above
it
was
slowly
descending
upon
me
but
never
reaching
me
and
when
i
looked
down
at
the
sand
the
rocks
seemed
to
be
growing
out
of
the
ground
beneath
the
surf
something
which
they
actually
do
in
certain
areas
but
whether
or
not
it
was
happening
here
something
i
still
am
not
sure
of
the
phenomenon
was
at
the
very
least
heightened
considerably

everything
around
me
was
coming
alive
this
once-empty
beach
was
now
surrounding
me
with
its
presence
the
street
lights
behind
the
dunes
seemed
to
wax
and
wane
sometimes
illuminating
the
haze
into
a
brilliant
artificial
orange
glow
sometimes
seemingly
disappearing
altogether
the
effect
only
added
to
size
and
distance
distortions
i
was
experiencing
everything
was
moving
nothing
was
concrete
the
haze
created
a
small
dome
around
me
in
which
i
could
clearly
see
it
was
my
cloud
of
perception
and
it
followed
me
wherever
i
went
keeping
me
out
of
reach
from
the
foggy
unknown
world
beyond
where
shadows
and
shapes
were
manifesting
and
disappearing
at
the
same
time

i
found
a
comfortable
seat
in
the
dune
flanked
by
two
hills
and
it
was
here
that
i
smoked
the
remaining
crystals
and
resin
that
was
left
in
my
dmt
pipe
right
after
i
inhaled
long
and
slow
the
haze
intensified
and
i
could
barely
even
make
out
the
water
in
front
of
me
it
was
probably
less
than
20
feet
away
the
dmt
effects
were
relatively
subtle
first
the
geometric
net
of
the
stars
was
noticeably
more
apparent
and
complex
but
still
following
the
same
slow
wiggly
descent
then
when
i
stood
up
in
a
moment
of
paranoia
and
saw
my
cloud
of
perception
to
be
maybe
10
feet
in
radius
i
had
the
distinct
feeling
that
i
was
no
longer
where
i
thought
i
was
that
i
had
journeyed
somewhere
entirely
different
there
were
more
shadow
figures
wandering
in
the
fog
now
though
never
coming
into
view
and
as
i
passed
a
mass
of
beached
seaweed
i
remember
thinking
that
it
looked
like
i
was
clearly
on
some
alien
planet

my
mind
was
still
accelerating
and
the
symphony
of
the
sea
was
ever-present
slowly
infiltrating
my
consciousness
though
i
didnt
realize
it
at
the
time
finding
distractions
everywhere
and
even
though
i
knew
on
a
conscious
level
that
i
was
just
on
the
beach
at
night
i
also
knew
both
consciously
and
unconsciously
that
i
had
stumbled
into
a
place
i
have
never
been
before
and
this
feeling
was
only
intensifying
as
i
wandered
farther
down
the
coast
to
a
land
where
the
gradual
slope
of
the
dunes
transforms
into
steep
cliffs

then
just
as
i
saw
another
shadow
figure
she
saw
me
and
i
saw
that
it
was
a
mutual
simultaneous
observance
she
seemed
to
say
something
to
me
and
i
seemed
to
respond
what
was
literally
said
or
what
it
sounded
like
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
but
i
realize
now
that
she
was
bidding
me
to
follow
and
i
was
accepting
i
began
walking
in
her
direction
which
was
roughly
the
same
direction
i
had
already
been
heading
but
there
was
such
a
distinct
presence
out
there
now
an
otherness
that
was
following
me
surrounding
me
but
staying
just
outside
of
my
sphere
of
perception
i
kept
looking
around
me
only
to
find
my
own
shadow
and
the
sound
of
my
own
footsteps
but
it
was
as
if
i
could
almost
touch
it
i
could
feel
it
getting
stronger
i
was
also
entering
an
incredibly
chaotic
state
of
mind
a
schizophrenic-like
stream
of
consciousness
where
there
were
multiple
voices
and
thoughts
in
my
head
simultaneously
and
i
could
not
differentiate
one
from
the
other
much
less
my
own
from
my
other

i
found
a
spot
on
the
cliff
where
the
rocks
jutted
out
providing
a
small
shelter
if
one
were
to
sit
right
against
the
wall
i
sat
down
here
and
began
to
pack
a
bowl
of
cannabis
less
than
a
minute
later
i
was
fleeing
from
the
site
in
panic
because
i
saw
and
felt
the
rocks
above
me
begin
to
crumble
apart
i
ventured
back
to
make
sure
the
cliff
was
still
standing
as
i
knew
it
was
and
that
i
was
just
tripping
face
i
walked
a
bit
farther
until
i
stopped
to
lean
against
the
rock
it
felt
so
strange
to
touch
it
and
as
i
was
gazing
at
it
trying
to
collect
myself
the
rocks
again
began
to
crack
and
crumble
apart
right
in
front
of
me
the
unknown
had
now
entered
my
sphere
of
perception
and
matter
was
dissolving
before
my
eyes

i
again
fell
back
from
them
in
utter
and
complete
terror
as
i
backed
up
and
as
the
fear
grew
the
cracks
grew
massive
climbing
up
the
walls
until
i
finally
calmed
myself
down
realizing
it
was
being
brought
on
by
my
emotions
i
considered
turning
back
at
this
point
but
i
knew
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
forgive
myself
if
i
did
i
was
out
there
looking
for
something
and
i
knew
i
would
find
it
if
i
kept
looking
so
i
ventured
farther
following
more
shadow
figures
in
the
fog
there
were
so
many
of
them
now
their
presence
still
intensifying
i
kept
walking
toward
her
ever-changing
shape
and
as
she
came
into
view
i
saw
that
it
was
a
stack
of
rocks
maybe
three
and
a
half
feet
high
but
stacked
perfectly
among
the
rest
of
the
stones
on
the
beach
it
struck
me
and
i
remember
looking
at
it
curious
but
i
did
not
stop
i
kept
walking
entering
a
still-higher
level
of
schizophrenia
everything
was
so
jumbled
i
eventually
sat
down
against
the
rocks
again
finally
smoking
that
bowl
i
was
tripping
so
incredibly
hard
at
this
point
i
remember
telling
myself
and
all
the
other
voices
in
my
head
that
im
just
sitting
which
made
me
laugh
out
loud
when
i
made
the
connection
with
the
buddha
and
just
how
ridiculous
this
all
was

i
began
listening
to
the
symphony
of
the
sea
again
i
was
being
lulled
into
a
trance
i
did
not
realize
it
at
the
time
but
it
was
her
she
had
led
me
there
egged
me
on
and
she
was
singing
to
me
now
her
voice
was
transcendent
once
in
her
trance
i
found
myself
to
be
in
a
multi-dimensional
sonic
space
the
rhythm
and
structure
of
her
song
created
these
pulsating
swirling
rhythmic
harmonies
that
were
of
a
complexity
so
incredible
so
beautiful
i
have
never
heard
anything
like
this
before
in
my
life
and
ive
been
to
the
beach
before
ive
heard
the
sound
of
the
surf
crashing
against
the
sea
and
sand
but
never
like
this

i
was
shaking
now
she
was
stringing
me
along
one
of
these
harmonic
columns
of
energy
spinning
swirling
whirring
and
then
right
after
a
momentary
eternity
of
silence
the
string
snapped
in
unraveled
and
i
heard
the
deep
guttural
roar
of
a
massive
wave
i
knew
it
immediately
when
i
heard
it
and
i
wept
at
its
beauty
tears
streamed
down
my
face
as
i
realized
what
had
just
happened
i
heard
a
wave
for
what
a
wave
really
is
not
some
rising
hill
of
water
that
breaks
on
itself
as
it
approaches
the
coast
but
a
huge
swirling
formation
of
energy
that
journeys
miles
a
minute
in
its
constant
cycle
as
this
all
sunk
in
i
was
still
trembling
my
pulse
was
tremoring
and
i
was
gasping
for
air
and
my
body
had
just
been
sitting
there
this
whole
time

i
channeled
her
and
she
channeled
me
and
the
spirit
of
the
water
had
led
me
there
against
the
rocks
where
i
could
hear
her
sing
the
rocks
she
had
led
me
to
were
shaped
perfectly
to
resonate
the
swirling
spinning
divine
rhythmic
harmonies
of
the
waves
deep
in
the
sea
i
could
ride
her
voice
for
miles
it
was
one
of
the
most
powerful
experiences
of
my
life
everything
was
clear
now
i
was
lucid
in
this
spirit
realm
and
i
was
in
harmony
with
her
dancing
with
her
the
presence
i
had
felt
encircling
me
was
now
a
part
of
me
i
spent
a
long
time
out
there
hypnotized
and
enraptured
by
her
breathtaking
roars
and
elaborate
cadence
it
resonated
within
my
soul
she
was
a
part
of
me
now
and
i
was
in
ecstasy

i
eventually
wandered
back
to
z
who
was
asleep
i
woke
her
up
to
tell
her
my
story
and
smoke
a
freshly
packed
bong
even
blocks
up
from
the
coastline
i
could
still
hear
her
and
i
could
feel
her
song
below
my
feet
we
got
in
the
car
and
drove
around
and
after
some
meandering
throughout
the
sleeping
city
pulled
on
to
a
street
where
a
massive
tractor
trailer
was
trying
pull
into
an
alley
i
felt
the
pulsating
in
my
soul
again
but
this
time
totally
different
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
power
lines
above
us
got
ripped
apart
exploding
in
a
cloud
of
white
sparks
i
yelled
at
z
to
back
up
because
if
the
pole
was
coming
down
it
wouldve
come
down
right
on
top
of
us
and
then
again
a
second
explosion
luckily
nothing
fell
and
everyone
was
alright
i
told
her
i
anticipated
it
feeling
it
before
seeing
it
and
she
said
she
felt
it
too
we
thought
it
might
have
been
a
small
earthquake
but
we
havent
been
able
to
corroborate
this
conjecture
in
all
likelihood
the
truck
got
caught
on
one
of
the
wires
and
snapped
it
apart
this
had
a
similar
apprehensive
feeling
as
the
wave
but
it
was
more
of
a
cosmic
punch
to
the
soul
than
a
trance-inducing
song

we
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
wandering
between
the
beach
and
the
car
and
wherever
i
went
whether
it
was
an
open
beach
where
the
sound
didnt
resonate
the
same
way
i
could
still
hear
her
i
could
still
hear
the
swirling
get
faster
and
faster
until
it
snapped
and
unraveled
exploding
in
the
crashing
of
a
wave
i
was
eventually
lulled
to
sleep
by
her
when
i
finally
lay
in
my
bed
well
after
dawn
when
i
woke
the
next
day
and
even
now
her
song
still
resonates
in
my
soul
the
sea
sounds
forever
different
to
me
now
i
went
back
to
the
same
spot
i
was
in
the
next
night
but
this
time
in
the
normal
material
world
where
both
the
haze
and
the
stars
were
less
visible
the
rocks
were
no
longer
stacked
up
and
i
could
only
barely
hear
that
whirring
energy
resonance
but
it
was
still
there

the
most
astonishing
thing
to
me
about
this
whole
experience
is
the
fact
that
i
actually
got
a
response
from
a
seemingly
unresponsive
universe
i
was
out
there
looking
for
spirits
or
some
kind
of
other
i
dont
even
really
know
my
normal
day-to-day
life
feels
different
now
even
though
i
was
in
such
an
altered
state
as
this
surely
ranks
among
the
strongest
trips
i
have
ever
had
and
even
though
i
am
a
little
unsure
about
the
linear
progression
of
events
i
have
no
doubt
about
what
i
heard
in
that
eternal
moment
she
sang
to
me




i
have
auditory
neuropathy
which
means
my
ears
would
work
if
the
neurons
that
brought
the
sound
to
my
brain
worked
but
i
have
lesions
covering
my
auditory
nerves
that
got
worse
as
i
grew
older
my
auditory
cortex
is
underdeveloped
as
a
result
but
can
still
function
primitively


my
homie
d
invited
me
over
to
his
pad
to
vaporize
some
of
the
purest
dmt
hes
found
and
smoke
a
couple
bowls
while
preparing
to
trip
i
show
up
and
he
is
lighting
incense
and
putting
up
trippy
tapestry
i
help
him
set
up
some
uv
lamps
and
lava
lamps
and
smoke
some
weed
out
of
his
lava
lamp
bong
by
the
time
we
were
done
setting
up
the
room
for
the
trip
we
had
blown
through
two
grams
of
weed
and
were
rightfully
stoned


d
pulls
out
his
vaporizer
weighs
out
50mg
and
puts
it
on
the
ceramic
nail
i
take
it
and
proceed
to
pull
in
as
much
vapor
as
i
could
held
it
in
for
20
or
so
seconds
and
let
it
out
i
repeat
this
once
more
this
time
finishing
off
the
rest
of
the
50mg
i
hold
it
in
longer
than
the
first
and
i
begin
to
accelerate
backwards


t-
0015
i
am
falling
i
see
colors
and
fractals
whizzing
past
me
as
i
tumble
into
an
alternate
reality
i
am
slightly
nervous
as
ive
never
tried
dmt
but
overall
feeling
cool

t-
0100
the
falling
sensation
eases
as
i
descend
into
this
new
world
i
imagine
i
am
entering
an
alien
atmosphere
on
an
alien
world
and
below
me
i
can
see
millions
of
creatures
scurrying
up
and
down
valleys
and
crevices
a
faint
vibration
can
be
felt
in
my
headspace

t-
0130
i
am
no
longer
focusing
on
the
creatures
that
stand
before
me
but
am
fixated
on
the
unknown
and
yet
familiar
feeling
that
is
filling
my
head
with
joy
and
wonder


t-
0145
i
realize
that
the
creatures
are
the
ones
making
this
vibration
and
if
i
face
one
way
the
vibration
can
be
felt
coming
from
the
other
direction
i
quickly
realize
that
i
am
hearing
these
scurriers
harmonize
and
sing

i
quickly
realize
that
i
am
hearing
these
scurriers
harmonize
and
sing

at
this
point
i
am
overjoyed
i
can
hear
and
i
dont
need
my
auditory
nerves
at
all
after
the
comedown
d
would
tell
me
that
i
was
crying
and
softly
saying
i
can
hear
i
can
hear

t-
0230
the
scurrying
creatures
are
just
a
memory
at
this
point
as
i
ride
the
multiversal
waves
of
energy
slipping
in
and
out
of
different
universes
each
with
a
distinct
and
beautiful
sound
emanating
deep
from
within
their
universal
cores
light
and
sound
were
synchronizing
and
as
the
lights
got
brighter
so
did
the
sound

t-
0330
i
am
now
coming
off
of
the
miracle
drug
with
waves
of
sound
blitzing
my
mind
occasionally
each
time
with
a
longer
interval
between
the
rings
i
am
back
in
ds
trippy
room
walls
are
moving
but
other
than
that
my
experience
had
come
to
an
end
we
embrace
each
other
and
we
call
it
a
night


apparently
hearing
for
the
first
time
is
exhausting

exhausting

because
i
slept
well
that
night




i
am
certain
that
dmt
has
changed
me
for
the
better

my
previous
health
problems
a
few
years
ago
i
got
very
ill
for
no
apparent
reason
while
no
diagnosis
was
able
to
be
given
at
the
time
as
tests
all
came
up
normal
i
was
later
told
by
my
psychologist
that
i
had
probably
had
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
cfs/me
the
illness
came
on
when
i
had
been
veggie
for
6
months
and
gave
up
oral
antibiotics
for
acne
after
a
period
of
over
a
decade
and
the
only
other
possible
factors
could
be
that
i
caught
a
nasty
food-poisoning/virus
thing
off
my
girlfriend
and
her
friends
and
possibly
was
under
stress
though
no
more
so
than
at
other
periods
in
my
life

whatever
the
cause
i
got
abnormally
skinny
and
pale
constantly
fatigued
stomach
pains
etc
needed
abnormal
amounts
of
sleep
but
never
felt
refreshed
felt
mentally
slow
and
eventually
got
to
a
point
where
i
was
having
dizzy
spells
and
felt
like
my
soul
was
being
ripped
from
my
body
to
an
inch
to
the
right
during
a
nauseous
period
i
would
have
at
the
same
time
every
afternoon
at
this
point
i
felt
i
must
make
the
choice
between
eating
meat
again
or
suicide
i
opted
for
meat
and
whether
coincidence
or
not
my
health
gradually
improved
over
the
next
6
months
however
i
never
got
back
to
the
same
level
of
energy
that
i
had
before
falling
ill
and
this
made
me
understandably
sad
and
lacklustre
which
is
why
i
started
seeing
a
psychologist

psychology
was
helpful
but
in
all
honesty
it
only
helped
me
to
accept
my
fate
because
i
never
regained
the
energy
and
enthusiasm
for
life
that
i
once
felt

cactus
helped
stop
binge
drinking
were
nearly
getting
to
the
dmt
bit
i
needed
to
stop
binge
drinking
which
i
had
been
doing
since
the
age
of
13
at
least
once
a
week
a
few
years
before
3
times
a
week
alcohol
was
definitely
enjoyable
escapism
as
well
as
being
used
to
counteract
shyness
when
young
my
hangovers
now
took
two
or
three
days
and
on
the
first
day
i
would
do
absolutely
nothing
not
even
get
out
of
bed
discovering
peruvian
torch
helped
me
curb
my
drinking
because
by
taking
5g
when
i
went
out
i
lost
that
hunger
to
continue
pouring
booze
down
my
throat
this
was
my
first
step
towards
healing
buying
the
book
feeling
good
the
new
mood
therapy
was
my
second
and
somehow
helped
me
far
more
than
the
psychologist
did

experimenting
with
ayahuasca
analog
i
then
heard
about
ayahuasca
and
tried
m
hostilis
with
rue
i
had
an
amazing
visionary
first
time
that
left
me
walking
on
air
for
the
rest
of
the
week
however
the
next
time
i
got
a
real
mental
pounding
from
the
rue
and
couldnt
get
enough
of
the
light
down
and
had
a
horrible
horrible
experience
that
was
in
no
way
helpful
whatsoever
-
i
was
already
aware
of
the
problems
that
surfaced
and
felt
depressed
for
days
afterwards
without
the
light
the
purge
was
a
really
nasty
experience
too

dmt
to
the
rescue
i
suspected
that
it
was
the
power
maoi
that
i
didnt
need
just
the
light
so
i
decided
to
try
smoking
dmt
instead
i
was
spot
on
its
as
if
dmt
and
i
were
made
for
each
other
after
3
years
i
feel
energy
and
enthusiasm
again
im
so
happy
and
i
have
decided
that
i
shall
be
smoking
dmt
weekly
for
the
rest
of
my
life
as
well
as
these
physical/psychological
effects
depending
on
whats
actually
happened
in
my
brain
when
im
out
i
have
no
desire
whatsoever
to
get
drunk
any
more
in
fact
i
actually
specifically
dont
want
to
drink
too
much
dmt
also
satisfies
my
spiritual
curiosity
as
if
it
were
filling
the
hole
left
inside
me
by
my
atheism
i
feel
loved
if
that
makes
any
sense
i
almost
feel
like
im
in
love
its
a
similar
feeling
dont
worry
i
dont
feel
in
any
danger
of
being
addicted
if
such
a
thing
is
possible

conjecture
on
dmt
as
a
medicine
not
much
is
known
about
cfs/me
its
a
syndrome
that
seems
to
have
emerged
with
my
generation
im
30
it
was
originally
called
me
because
they
thought
it
was
caused
by
brain
swelling
that
theory
is
no
longer
in
favour
and
its
name
changed
to
cfs
but
they
call
it
cfs/me
still
because
sufferers
are
keen
to
keep
the
physical
connotations
of
the
me
label
in
defence
of
unsympathetic
people
who
think
sufferers
are
just
lazy
a
recent
theory
is
that
a
virus
is
caught
which
causes
mild
brain
damage
in
the
relevant
areas
of
the
brain
such
that
while
the
patient
has
recovered
entirely
from
the
virus
the
brain
still
believes
and
acts
as
if
the
patient
is
still
ill
hence
the
fatigue
inactivity
and
excess
sleep
extreme
sufferers
even
feel
debilitating
pain
and
muscle
aches
but
fortunately
i
didnt
suffer
that
badly

so
i
think
its
interesting
that
people
attest
that
dmt
cures
them
of
headaches
and
distracts
them
from
pain
for
me
i
feel
like
it
has
lifted
the
trick
that
my
brain
physically
damaged
or
not
was
playing
on
me
i
will
let
you
know
if
my
current
situation
changes
but
i
dont
feel
like
it
will
i
feel
right
again
hope
this
tale
is
of
value

28th
jan
2008
it
has
now
been
over
9
weeks
since
i
first
smoked
dmt
and
ive
been
happy
the
whole
way
through
its
about
3
months
since
i
first
drank
aya
analog

i
have
never
been
this
happy
and
emotionally
healthy
in
my
entire
life

recently
i
didnt
smoke
it
for
3
weeks
and
still
felt
fine
although
was
starting
to
become
a
bit
more
negative
again

i
expect
that
eventually
i
wont
need
it
at
all
it
having
taught
me
to
be
optimistic
inspired
and
motivated
again




i
have
been
experiencing
medium
to
intense
headaches
for
about
1
1/2
years
as
of
now
11/02

i
most
often
notice
the
headaches
when
reading
watching
a
movie
or
working
on
the
computer

when
they
are
at
their
strongest
point
i
cannot
read
or
look
at
something
any
longer

it
seems
as
though
there
is
tremendous
pressure
in
my
eyes
or
like
my
eye
muscles
are
completely
sore
and
tired

i
have
been
to
doctors
numerous
times
but
they
cannot
find
the
problem



recently
i
have
found
complete
relief
from
these
headaches
by
using
psilocybin

some
times
the
relief
lasts
several
days
-
maybe
up
to
a
week

i
also
found
that
dmt
also
works
at
low
dosages
10-30mg

i
wonderhas
anyone
else
found
relief
in
these
substances

does
anyone
use
these
or
other
medications
on
a
regular
basis
to
control
headaches

triptamine




i
had
my
first
cluster
headache
when
i
was
15
i
can
still
remember
it
clearly
although
i
had
only
heard
about
migrane
as
some
kind
of
nastyass
headache
i
immideatly
almost
instictivly
recognized
it
as
such
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
past
few
years
things
have
really
improved
for
me
though
since
i
first
tried
mushrooms
the
attacks
are
fewer
in
numbers
i
do
however
doubt
that
the
change
is
to
be
accredited
to
the
mushroom
alone
the
decrease
in
headache-attacks
started
even
before
i
ever
tried
mushrooms
at
present
i
dont
really
suffer
from
it
i
get
it
about
once
every
other
month
but
the
attacks
are
very
painful
and
incapacitating
they
usually
last
about
4-5h
including
a
2h
onset
before
the
real
headache

ive
tried
alot
of
different
things
to
treat
the
attacks
as
they
occur
a
large
dose
of
strong
tylenols
smoking
opium
weed
etc
smoking
weed
didnt
really
affect
the
condition
in
any
direction
opium
is
quite
alright
actually
but
it
rarely
falls
in
my
lap
and
when
it
does
i
run
out
all
too
fast
then
there
is
what
i
usually
take
good
old
tylenol
/w
30mg
codeine
i
crush
4
pills
and
add
to
a
glass
of
water
and
down
quickly
its
no
miracle
cure
but
better
than
nothing

this
night
however
the
migrane
would
appear
at
a
very
bad
time
the
plan
was
set
for
me
and
my
buddie
to
venture
of
into
hyperspace
this
was
a
well
planned
session
before
i
even
met
up
with
him
i
could
feel
it
a
mild
headache
it
just
hadnt
caught
my
attention
yet
we
walked
back
to
my
appartment
where
the
smoking
was
to
take
place
we
prepared
the
place
with
some
candles
and
incense
and
so
on
but
i
was
really
starting
to
hesitate
now
the
headache
grew
worse
by
the
minute
and
now
i
knew
that
alot
more
was
to
come
by
coincidence
i
was
also
all
out
of
tylenols
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
nice
evening
was
turning
into
a
nightmare

my
typical
symptoms
when
the
headache
really
starts
distinguising
itself
include
a
painful
pressure
behind
the
left
eye
which
usually
spreads
up
my
forehead
vision
becomes
severly
impaired
but
nausea
is
actually
rare
loud
sounds
and
bright
light
usually
triggers
tremendous
pain
thinking
becomes
difficult
i
didnt
really
feel
like
riding
it
all
out
without
anything
to
help
me
through
it
so
an
idea
popped
up
in
my
head
the
dmt
that
was
something
we
had
plenty
of
right
now
and
right
here
as
i
said
ive
had
good
experiences
from
mushrooms
easing
my
headaches
and
i
was
also
well
aware
how
ergot
was
used
in
treatment
of
migrane
the
structural
similarities
between
all
of
these
compounds
are
obvious
to
anyone
when
comparing
them
side
by
side
i
carefully
considered
what
the
worst
thing
that
might
happen
could
be
this
was
not
all
too
obvious
as
i
was
unsure
if
the
headache
would
affect
my
trip
in
a
negative
way
i
decided
to
go
for
it

at
this
point
i
was
in
some
pain
i
had
problems
keeping
my
eyes
open
due
to
the
fact
that
it
hurt
to
look
at
things
sounds
were
slightly
distorted
and
amplified
the
pipe
was
loaded
with
30mg
and
handed
to
me
i
emptied
the
pipe
in
one
huge
breath
and
laied
down
on
the
couch
what
happends
next
still
baffles
me
right
before
i
enter
hyperspace
i
feel
something
snap
in
my
forehead
and
just
like
that
my
headache
is
gone
not
just
dulled
away
by
drugs
but
actually
completely
gone
the
experience
itself
was
not
affected
by
this
at
all
although
i
would
still
advice
anyone
attempting
anything
similar
to
use
caution
and
the
headache
didnt
return
when
the
experience
ended
ill
definitely
try
this
again
when
the
circumstances
are
ok




i
am
writing
this
experience
outline
approximately
two
years
after
it
happened
so
i
am
sure
there
are
a
few
minor
details
that
have
faded
since
then
i
will
however
do
my
best
to
recollect
as
much
of
that
afternoon
as
i
can

it
was
lightly
drizzling
outside
sun
creeping
through
the
clouds
stereotypical
day
between
winter
and
spring
there
was
a
subtle
undertone
of
new
beginnings
in
the
air
the
smell
of
petrichor
as
i
walked
up
to
my
friends
house
set
the
mood
for
what
was
to
come


i
am
greeted
by
two
of
my
buddies
one
male
and
one
female
i
walk
with
them
to
their
room
in
which
resides
a
large
tank
of
healthy
and
beautiful
freshwater
fish
i
sit
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
nervously
shaking
for
what
i
was
anticipating
my
friend
b
could
see
i
was
nervous
we
spent
the
next
twenty
minutes
discussing
my
anxieties
and
my
expectations
i
knew
what
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
experience
and
i
knew
why
i
wanted
these
things
i
wanted
to
see
some
sort
of
objectivity
i
felt
as
though
i
was
drifting
from
my
core
and
needed
some
sort
of
knowledge
that
would
assist
me
in
becoming
a
better
person
i
had
recently
begun
feeling
more
distant
from
family
and
was
beginning
to
have
a
sort
of
existential
crisis
i
was
an
atheist
and
had
no
belief
or
disbelief
in
any
deity
or
afterlife
so
it
raised
many
unanswerable
questions
that
would
make
me
feel
uneasy
i
wanted
to
feel
more
connected
so
i
decided
to
do
some
inward
exploring
this
is
where
dmt
came
into
the
picture

i
wanted
to
feel
more
connected
so
i
decided
to
do
some
inward
exploring
this
is
where
dmt
came
into
the
picture



my
friend
b
knew
how
to
extract
dmt
from
mimosa
hostilis
root-bark
powder
and
taught
me
how
to
do
it
we
did
a
pull/batch
the
day
before
so
i
knew
exactly
where
this
particular
dmt
came
from
this
got
rid
of
any
suspicion
i
could
have
possibly
had
before
learning
how
to
extract
it
i
did
research
on
the
substance
and
read
experience
reports
i
wanted
to
go
into
this
as
over
prepared
as
possible
little
did
i
know
it
would
not
matter
how
much
i
knew
about
it
it
would
still
be
just
as
intense
and
flabbergasting


back
to
the
side
of
the
bed
my
friend
b
asks
if
i
am
ready
i
tell
him
im
as
ready
as
i
think
ill
ever
be
he
puts
a
very
small
cannabis
bud
at
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
and
delicately
sets
the
white
powdered
crystal
on
top
he
informs
me
that
he
will
be
holding
the
bowl
and
lighting
it
for
me
which
puts
me
even
more
at
ease
i
put
my
mouth
up
to
the
pipe
and
he
puts
the
lighter
near
the
crystals
he
is
very
careful
not
to
burn
anything
just
melt
and
vaporize
i
fill
up
the
pipe
and
inhale
the
taste
and
smell
are
ancient
the
plastic-like
taste
runs
through
my
whole
body


as
alien
as
this
is
to
me
i
take
another
hit
this
particular
hit
kicked
things
up
a
few
notches
objects
became
more
vibrant
matter
was
lightly
pulsating
and
this
electronic
hum
in
the
air
became
significantly
louder
than
normal
i
had
to
take
about
20
seconds
to
let
it
marinade
as
i
sit
there
i
notice
that
déjà
vu
was
starting
to
blend
with
every
moment
i
felt
as
though
certain
human
things
were
starting
to
dissolve
i
somehow
took
my
third
and
last
hit
and
b
withdrew
to
give
me
room
to
lay
down


the
electronic
hum
became
even
more
loud
as
though
its
always
there
and
we
are
conditioned
to
not
notice
it
this
strong
vibration
took
away
my
sense
of
free
will
which
was
a
magnificent
thing
to
observe
at
first
these
alien
feelings
made
me
a
bit
scared
made
me
want
to
undo
what
i
did
but
i
quickly
forgot
about
my
feelings
and
became
fascinated
with
what
was
happening
all
around
me
i
looked
around
the
room
slowly
watching
objects
fold
in
and
out
of
each
other
colors
i
had
never
seen
in
this
room
were
flowing
like
electricity
golds
greens
reds
and
unknown
combinations
of
earthly
colors
were
introducing
themselves
to
me
i
soon
became
overwhelmed
and
decided
to
lie
down
and
close
my
eyes

my
mindscape
revealed
itself
to
me
to
be
related
to
matter
as
it
was
folding
in
and
out
of
itself
in
various
dimensions
i
watched
infinite
self-tessellating
objects
intertwine
and
glow
gold
and
red
it
was
an
ancient
and
beautiful
pattern
that
i
will
never
forget
at
this
point
i
wondered
why
i
was
experiencing
this


what
happened
next
is
something
i
half-expected
i
had
read
up
on
dmt
experiences
and
knew
many
if
not
most
people
have
interactions
with
beings
it
was
still
not
something
a
first-timer
can
mentally
prepare
for
these
self-tessellating
patterns
began
morphing
into
hominid
shapes
three
beings
appeared
out
of
the
infinity
what
felt
like
right
in
front
of
me
in
retrospect
it
was
inside
of
me
they
still
retained
several
qualities
of
my
mindscape
they
were
still
tessellated
next
to
each
other
even
though
they
seemed
to
be
of
a
higher
dimension
and
their
\x93faces
were
taking
the
form
of
something
my
mind
could
understand
i
still
remember
their
original
forms
wide
and
happy
grins
pitch
black
eyes
short
bodies
made
of
a
seemingly
unknown
energy
to
me
but
this
original
form
soon
became
replaced
with
what
my
mind
could
make
sense
of
family
i
saw
my
mothers
face
my
stepfathers
face
and
my
uncles
face
they
were
without
words
telling
me
they
loved
me
unconditionally
and
were
happy
to
see
me
it
felt
as
though
they
were
happily
humming
into
my
brain
trying
to
soothe
me
and
let
me
know
everything
was
alright


once
i
came
to
peace
with
my
experience
they
folded
back
into
my
mindscape
i
felt
the
dmt
loosen
its
grip
and
i
opened
my
eyes
once
i
saw
my
friends
b
and
l
i
instantly
remembered
that
i
had
inhaled
dmt
my
sober
mind
started
to
rise
and
i
could
see
things
very
clearly
i
was
shaking
with
excitement
and
was
rushing
through
my
previous
5
minutes
so
i
could
remember
as
much
as
i
could
i
started
analyzing
every
feeling
i
had
during
my
\x93trip
and
tried
to
make
sense
of
everything
as
alien
as
the
experience
felt
while
it
was
happening
i
could
not
shake
the
sense
of
familiarity
once
i
came
back
it
felt
like
i
had
been
there
before
a
long
long
time
ago


i
had
come
to
a
few
conclusions
about
my
experience
at
the
time
conclusions
that
i
still
cannot
shake
i
felt
as
though
the
human
condition/experience
is
partially
created/monitored
by
endogenous
dmt
when
i
inhaled
the
dmt
vapor
i
was
figuratively
turning
the
frequency
dial
on
my
perception
the
subtle
hum
that
i
heard
after
the
first
hit
was
the
sound
air
particles
make
when
they
collide
and
comingle
i
felt
as
though
humans
had
evolved
to
not
hear
the
sound
since
it
serves
no
purpose
other
than
a
minor
annoyance
another
conclusion
i
came
to
was
that
our
brains
are
programmed
to
take
in
certain
input
and
turn
that
into
a
perceivable
reality
by
that
logic
when
i
inhaled
dmt
i
was
reprogramming
my
brain
to
use
different
energy
as
input
energy
coming
from
within
instead
of
from
the
outside
world
in
my
opinion
the
beings
i
interacted
with
were
a
construct
of
the
human
psyche
possibly
ancient
this
would
also
explain
why
almost
everyone
who
experiences
dmt
has
contact
with
some
sort
of
sapient
entity


this
is
where
i
will
wrap
up
my
experience
in
a
nutshell
beginning
of
spring
went
to
friends
house
discussed
my
apprehensive
feelings
with
him
went
over
my
goals
in
my
head
wanting
to
become
more
aware
and
connected
with
things
that
matter
took
3
large
hits
in
a
time
span
of
a
few
minutes
objects
morphed
and
folded
colors
became
more
intense
déjà
vu
became
more
frequent
free
will
dissolved
humming
took
over
everything
nervousness
inevitably
subsided
saw
the
beauty
of
the
human
mind
witnessed
and
interacted
with
3
mysterious
sapient
beings
that
communicated
without
spoken
words
perceived
them
as
family
realized
how
loving
and
awesome
my
family
is
realized
how
complex
the
universe
really
is
and
how
i
need
to
be
at
peace
with
not
knowing
most
things
and
realized
how
i
need
to
value
this
moment
to
moment
experience


overall
a
very
positive
and
very
intense
experience
and
was
my
only
time
using
dmt
i
think
the
reason
i
had
such
a
positive
experience
was
a
combination
of
the
dmt
being
very
pure
white
crystals
extracted
by
my
friend
b
and
myself
the
weather
being
promising
my
friends
being
quiet
and
mature
and
my
willingness
to
learn
what
i
could
from
such
a
bizarre
experience
i
know
i
will
use
dmt
again
some
day
but
only
when
the
circumstance
presents
itself
in
a
proper
fashion




one
morning
i
woke
up
from
a
dream
where
i
had
been
flying
and
taking
a
lot
of
different
psychedelics
as
a
bunch
of
my
friends
were
having
a
party
down
below
but
who
am
i
kidding
that
sounds
like
half
of
my
dreams
specific
to
this
dream
i
had
this
night
returned
to
a
location
which
i
had
gone
to
the
past
summer
on
a
recent
vacation
it
was
a
nice
little
cabin
on
a
lake
with
a
dock
a
nice
deck
and
a
boat
rental
this
vacation
was
really
significant
for
me
because
i
had
gone
on
it
with
two
of
my
long-time
best
friends
and
also
because
when
looking
back
it
marks
a
major
turning
point
in
my
life
where
i
realized
for
sure
that
i
cant
be
depending
on
other
people
to
support
myself-
at
all
if
i
can
help
it

i
have
many
of
my
own
responsibilities
but
my
parents
still
help
me
out
with
a
fair
amount
of
expenses
as
i
am
a
full
time
student
i
feel
that
the
reality
hit
me
that
i
really
needed
to
start
taking
steps
in
the
direction
of
being
completely
financially
independent
because
of
some
events
and
exchanges
id
had
with
my
mother
during
this
vacation
that
had
really
gotten
me
thinking
about
this
being
reminded
of
this
concept
on
this
morning
i
was
glad
to
find
that
i
felt
more
motivated
than
scared
i
had
an
interesting
mindset
going
where
i
was
thinking
things
along
the
lines
of
well
ive
always
done
everything
i
needed
to
do
to
take
care
of
myself
in
the
past

ive
made
the
impossible
happen
before
if
i
really
need
it
and
want
it
the
universe
will
take
care
of
me
and
even
if
i
dont
succeed
by
the
standards
of
others
i
will
have
succeeded
as
long
as
im
a
good
person
however
i
will
tackle
all
the
things
that
i
need
to
get
down
in
order
to
become
completely
independent
because
i
dont
want
to
impose
on
others
of
course
so
yes
an
empowered
and
positive
mindset

the
point
is
i
suppose
that
this
dream
and
the
residual
feeling
left
from
it
inspired
me
to
decide
to
embark
on
a
real
life
journey
that
day

so
not
even
an
hour
after
waking
up
i
decided
that
i
wanted
to
have
some
dpt
i
know
that
dpt
dosage
can
vary
considerably
from
person
to
person
but
luckily
i
am
one
of
those
people
who
doesnt
need
much
of
it
to
have
a
full-blown
experience
i
set
aside
about
25mg
of
dpt
my
route
of
administration
was
insufflation
because
i
only
have
the
hcl
salt
and
not
the
freebase
form

the
dpt
seemed
to
come
on
a
little
more
slowly
and
gently
than
usual
but
maybe
thats
only
because
i
was
already
in
a
dreamy
headspace
before
i
even
had
it
i
smoked
a
bowl
of
cannabis
which
kicked
it
in
for
sure
it
almost
seemed
like
the
tryptamine
had
carried
me
over
from
my
sleeping
dream
realm
into
my
waking
life
dream
realm
if
that
makes
sense
still
though
the
trip
was
pretty
intense
and
overwhelming
as
one
can
only
expect
with
dpt
there
was
a
point
where
i
became
confused
feeling
that
i
was
still
my
dream
self
in
the
aforementioned
dreams
but
still
residing
in
this
reality
the
wrong
one
but
i
was
able
to
think
this
away
as
i
entertained
the
idea
of
this
concept
being
the
theme
for
a
story

then
i
thought
to
myself
what
is
life
but
a
big
story
and
what
are
we
all
but
characters
anyway
this
comforted
me
greatly
and
left
me
with
a
sense
of
intrigue
i
started
to
feel
the
wonderful
electric
surges
of
energy
that
are
characteristic
of
some
tryptamines
some
people
interpret
it
as
kundalini
some
say
that
its
just
the
feeling
of
the
energy
flow
which
we
are
ultra-receptive
to
some
call
it
a
body
load
i
dont
like
that
term
because
it
sounds
negative
and
this
feeling
for
me
is
far
from
negative
this
feeling
was
greatly
pleasurable
and
meaningful
to
me
as
usual
it
reminds
me
of
something
that
i
may
or
may
not
have
experienced
long
long
ago
it
is
like
existing
as
pure
energy

there
was
a
point
where
i
randomly
felt
a
little
bit
scared/alarmed
out
of
nowhere
i
felt
the
fear
as
if
that
center
of
my
brain
had
just
been
activated
for
no
particular
reason
luckily
i
didnt
feel
that
it
was
anything
other
than
a
strange
unwarranted
emotion
and
couldnt
really
make
sense
of
it
so
i
didnt
dwell
on
it
i
reminded
myself
that
to
be
human
and
have
the
brain
and
the
consciousness
that
i
do
that
allows
me
to
be
able
to
undergo
this
experience
was
beautiful
that
to
be
able
to
succumb
to
the
tryptamine
was
a
wonderful
gift
indeed
it
felt
so
freeing
to
give
up
all
control
and
allow
myself
to
be
taken
wherever
i
began
to
drift
on
the
waves
of
the
electric
ocean
of
consciousness
peacefully

all
my
boundaries
dissolved
and
i
experienced
the
familiar
sensation
of
having
been
woven
into
the
fabric
of
existence
in
just
the
right
location
i
felt
my
self
and
everything
i
knew
disintegrate
it
was
all
at
once
liberating
relieving
orgasmic
terrifying
euphoric
synthetically
shocking
and
also
just
simply
*right*
more
right
than
anything
i
could
ever
experience
on
this
day
to
day
earthly
realm
for
sure
looking
back
i
feel
like
i
might
have
to
be
somewhat
masochistic
to
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
did
but
maybe
its
just
that
i
truly
feel
that
i
belong
in
that
state
rather
than
in
a
body
form
it
feels
more
genuine
to
me
i
reached
that
place
where
everything
in
my
life
and
seemingly
other
lives
too
culminated
that
place
where
you
always
return
to
where
every
thing
situation
person
and
location
exists
at
once
and
in
the
same
space

my
abstract
thoughts
and
imagery
took
me
on
a
rafting
journey
along
the
stream
of
consciousness
i
later
felt
that
this
paralleled
my
need
to
be
okay
with
whatever
happens
in
my
life
and
not
worry
about
rigid
plans
right
now
as
i
am
currently
in
the
middle
of
a
predicament
of
sorts
and
there
unfortunately
isnt
much
that
i
can
do
other
than
wait
it
out
i
tranced
out
for
a
long
time
in
a
blissful
ego-lossy
state
and
when
i
returned
i
remember
dreamlike
visions
and
dmt-esque
visuals

after
i
felt
a
little
less
tranced
out
i
smoked
another
bowl
and
looked
around
the
room
and
watched
static-colored
fractalized
patterning
appear
on
the
wall
enhanced
by
the
sunlight
on
the
wall
i
felt
that
i
didnt
really
know
what
any
of
this
was
that
i
was
seeing
but
it
was
beautiful
and
i
wanted
to
bask
in
it
and
give
it
all
the
appreciation
it
deserved
i
watched
woodwork
wave
then
morph
into
complex
emotionally
expressive
beings
i
felt
like
i
related
to
each
and
every
one
of
them
which
abstractly
reminded
me
of
being
able
to
empathize
and
connect
on
some
level
with
every
other
conscious
life
form
in
existence
i
cried
because
of
how
marvelous
and
beautiful
this
idea
was
to
me

the
song
system
700
by
younger
brother
suddenly
started
to
pervade
my
thoughts
a
specific
instrumental
portion
of
the
song
was
playing
in
my
head
and
at
first
i
didnt
realize
what
song
it
was
even
from
because
i
sometimes
overlook
this
song
on
the
album
though
i
do
really
like
it
but
then
i
remembered
i
also
started
thinking
about
the
artist/duo
cocorosie
for
some
reason
and
remembered
having
read
about
how
their
dad
had
taken
them
on
spirit
journeys
in
the
desert
when
they
were
younger
i
dont
know
many
details
of
some
of
the
spirit
journeys
so
*i
could
be
wrong*
but
i
think
i
recall
reading
somewhere
that
the
two
members
of
the
band
sisters
considered
the
experiences
to
be
somewhat
traumatizing
and
many
of
their
songs
seem
to
reflect
on
these
memories
all
of
these
thoughts
were
very
abstract
to
me
at
the
time
and
they
werent
processed
in
such
a
linear
fashion
as
i
describe
them
to
be
here
but
this
is
the
best
way
to
describe
the
experience

so
i
decided
to
listen
to
system
700
by
younger
brother
and
smokey
taboo
by
cocorosie
in
the
second
song
i
found
the
lyrics
midnight
to
noon
im
a
desert
child
and
mountains
make
me
nauseous
to
remind
me
of
mescaline
and
i
wondered
whether
their
spirit
journeys
had
included
psychedelics
the
singing
was
amazingly
hauntingly
beautiful
i
could
hear
and
feel
the
overwhelming
emotion
of
such
yearning
in
her
voice
those
were
the
only
two
songs
i
listened
to
during
this
trip
both
of
them
absolutely
blew
me
away

after
listening
to
the
music
about
an
hour
and
a
half
after
dosing
dpt
i
decided
that
it
was
probably
about
time
to
have
the
dmt
so
i
went
into
the
other
room
and
set
up
a
nice
comfy
area
and
fixed
up
my
special
dmt
smoking
device
i
put
about
30mg
of
dmt
in
the
pipe
which
is
about
25%
lower
than
what
is
usually
a
good
dose
for
me
i
figured
that
the
dpt
would
potentate
the
dmt
quite
a
bit
anyway
i
sat
down
for
a
few
minutes
with
the
dmt
pipe
ready
and
relaxed
to
prepare
myself
for
the
experience
and
clear
my
mind

three
hits
of
dmt
the
buzzing
and
alien-like
feeling
were
much
more
apparent
with
dpt
as
part
of
the
equation
but
it
also
felt
more
earthy
too
at
the
same
time
the
bringing
together
of
opposites
and
non-duality
were
big
parts
of
this
experience
good
or
bad
every
set
of
opposites
felt
exactly
the
same
i
experienced
everything
at
once
every
feeling
that
id
ever
felt
in
my
life
it
seemed
like
synaesthetically
it
was
like
the
way
a
torrent
looks
when
its
being
downloaded
where
certain
bits
are
done
and
they
show
up
as
strips
of
color
and
other
parts
arent
it
was
like
i
was
accessing
different
bits
of
color
and
each
bit
was
a
feeling
id
had
at
some
point
in
my
life
but
i
was
experiencing
them
so
rapidly
that
im
not
sure
whether
they
were
happening
at
the
same
time
or
what
i
guess
its
hard
to
say
i
had
visions
of
a
lot
of
blue
cut
outs
that
looked
like
the
style
of
people
or
pedestrians
often
depicted
in
road
signs
frame-skipped
in
odd
patterns
across
my
field
of
vision
so
did
pencils
textbooks
globes
maps
computers
plane
tickets
and
anything
that
had
to
do
with
acquiring
knowledge
or
experience

somehow
there
was
an
academic
tone
to
this
experience
if
that
makes
any
sense
during
the
dmt
i
once
again
lost
complete
contact
with
this
reality
and
when
coming
back
had
to
come
back
to
everything
over
yet
again
this
time
it
felt
a
little
bit
different
than
last
time
i
realized
abstractly
that
for
comparison
every
time
i
woke
up
i
actually
felt
like
a
different
person
in
some
way
as
well-
probably
because
of
the
ideas
and
memories
instilled
in
my
mind
during
dreams
as
i
came
down
from
the
dmt
i
looked
around
and
watched
the
carpet
move
in
an
extremely
odd
way-
it
looked
like
there
was
some
sort
of
animal
burrowing
around
underneath
it
almost
the
way
it
moved
from
place
to
place
yet
it
was
very
slow
like
lava
bubbling
up
underneath
it

i
also
experienced
the
typical
dmt-ish
frame-shifting
open
eye
visuals
as
well
where
i
move
my
eyes
over
an
object
and
it
doesnt
seem
like
the
object
continues
in
a
linear
way
instead
it
seems
to
crunch
in
on
itself
and
take
on
different
forms
as
i
move
my
eyes
from
place
to
place
in
a
once
again
shifting
way
rather
than
continual
sometimes
things
look
so
funny
when
this
happens
that
i
just
experiment
with
it
and
look
over
the
same
thing
multiple
times
to
see
how
many
strange
ways
it
can
crunch
in
on
itself
i
did
this
for
a
little
bit
and
thought
about
how
the
human
mind
works
how
bizarre
its
wiring
must
be
how
we
are
organic
technology

soon
i
was
down
from
the
dmt
and
coming
down
rapidly
from
the
dpt
as
well
i
felt
very
thankful
to
have
just
had
such
an
amazing
experience
my
mind
felt
cleansed
like
all
the
cobwebs
had
been
cleared
out
sometimes
i
need
a
good
defragging
of
the
mind
so
to
speak
i
drifted
off
to
take
a
little
nap
so
that
i
would
be
able
to
level
off
more
for
the
day
when
i
woke
up
in
the
late
afternoon

in
conclusion
i
must
say
that
i
think
dpt
is
a
very
special
material
i
have
thought
this
for
a
long
while
now
through
all
of
my
trials
with
it
it
has
some
things
in
common
with
dmt
as
in
it
comes
up
very
similarly
but
more
drawn
out
its
very
ego-shattering
and
completely
bizarre
otherworldly
and
alien-feeling
but
it
is
feels
more
trancelike
and
warm
in
my
experience
i
have
also
never
experienced
the
type
of
entity
contact
effects
that
i
have
on
dmt
with
it
though
i
have
felt
a
type
of
presence
for
sure
i
feel
that
dpt
is
good
for
accessing
emotions
and
subconscious
thoughts
enabling
one
to
work
with
these
retrieved
treasures
from
the
subconscious
whereas
dmt
is
more
of
a
blur
in
this
department
though
it
is
hit
or
miss
and
there
are
always
exceptions

in
any
case
from
my
own
experience
and
those
of
others
that
i
have
read
dpt
seems
to
provide
a
very
direct
line
to
ones
core
self
deep
emotions
and
consciousness
that
are
below
everything
else
that
is
piled
on
top
of
them
i
can
see
a
lot
of
therapeutic
and
spiritual
potential
in
this
compound
last
but
not
least
dmt
seems
to
go
very
well
with
it




i
had
always
wanted
to
try
pure
dmt
and
eventually
it
did
come
to
me
my
first
time
smoking

dmt
on
basil
was
very
smooth
and
pleasent
but
this
particular
trip
was
by
far
the
most
compelling
i
had
snorted
very
small
amounts
before
with
little
effect
and
i
had
researched
if
it
was
possible
to
be
absorbed
nasally
so
i
decided
to
insulfflate
a
lot
the
onset
was
about
5
min
and
unfortunately
my
mom
came
home
right
when
i
started
to
feel
it
which
made
me
extremely
scared
i
ran
in
the
bathroom
and
purged
what
looked
literally
like
green
slime
i
had
never
purged
before
from
the
many
times
using
dmt
extract
my
mom
was
right
next
to
the
door
when
i
came
out
my
mom
freaked
out
and
said
what
are
you
on
your
pupils
are
huge
so
i
lied
saying
i
ate
some
mushrooms
because
she
knew
i
was
growing
shrooms
and
she
was
always
getting
mad
at
me
and
telling
me
i
need
to
get
rid
of
them
and
there
costing
a
lot
on
her
electrical
bill
but
it
was
just
that
tiny
hydroshroom
kit
still
i
didnt
want
her
to
know
that
i
had
more
than
that


so
she
basically
talked
to
me
for
like
10
min
lecturing
and
in
the
back
of
my
head
while
im
tripping
hard
im
telling
myself
please
leave
me
alone
please
leave
me
alone
why
do
you
think
im
such
a
bad
person
the
whole
time
everything
looked
brand
new
as
if
i
was
just
born
i
saw
many
patterns
trails
similar
to
lsd
after
she
left
i
laid
down
and
closed
my
eyes
but
i
could
still
see
everything
in
my
room
360
degrees
so
i
opened
my
eyes
again
and
i
saw
the
patterns
in
the
ceiling
closed
my
eyes
again
and
saw
my
whole
room
again
the
whole
trip
lasted
a
little
over
30
min
i
would
describe
it
as
a
bad
but
kinda
of
good
because
it
ended
up
being
spiritual
towards
the
end
i
got
extremely
bad
vibes
from
my
mom
i
didnt
want
to
go
to
jail
again




i
had
my
first
cluster
headache
when
i
was
15
i
can
still
remember
it
clearly
although
i
had
only
heard
about
migrane
as
some
kind
of
nastyass
headache
i
immideatly
almost
instictivly
recognized
it
as
such
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
past
few
years
things
have
really
improved
for
me
though
since
i
first
tried
mushrooms
the
attacks
are
fewer
in
numbers
i
do
however
doubt
that
the
change
is
to
be
accredited
to
the
mushroom
alone
the
decrease
in
headache-attacks
started
even
before
i
ever
tried
mushrooms
at
present
i
dont
really
suffer
from
it
i
get
it
about
once
every
other
month
but
the
attacks
are
very
painful
and
incapacitating
they
usually
last
about
4-5h
including
a
2h
onset
before
the
real
headache

ive
tried
alot
of
different
things
to
treat
the
attacks
as
they
occur
a
large
dose
of
strong
tylenols
smoking
opium
weed
etc
smoking
weed
didnt
really
affect
the
condition
in
any
direction
opium
is
quite
alright
actually
but
it
rarely
falls
in
my
lap
and
when
it
does
i
run
out
all
too
fast
then
there
is
what
i
usually
take
good
old
tylenol
/w
30mg
codeine
i
crush
4
pills
and
add
to
a
glass
of
water
and
down
quickly
its
no
miracle
cure
but
better
than
nothing

this
night
however
the
migrane
would
appear
at
a
very
bad
time
the
plan
was
set
for
me
and
my
buddie
to
venture
of
into
hyperspace
this
was
a
well
planned
session
before
i
even
met
up
with
him
i
could
feel
it
a
mild
headache
it
just
hadnt
caught
my
attention
yet
we
walked
back
to
my
appartment
where
the
smoking
was
to
take
place
we
prepared
the
place
with
some
candles
and
incense
and
so
on
but
i
was
really
starting
to
hesitate
now
the
headache
grew
worse
by
the
minute
and
now
i
knew
that
alot
more
was
to
come
by
coincidence
i
was
also
all
out
of
tylenols
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
nice
evening
was
turning
into
a
nightmare

my
typical
symptoms
when
the
headache
really
starts
distinguising
itself
include
a
painful
pressure
behind
the
left
eye
which
usually
spreads
up
my
forehead
vision
becomes
severly
impaired
but
nausea
is
actually
rare
loud
sounds
and
bright
light
usually
triggers
tremendous
pain
thinking
becomes
difficult
i
didnt
really
feel
like
riding
it
all
out
without
anything
to
help
me
through
it
so
an
idea
popped
up
in
my
head
the
dmt
that
was
something
we
had
plenty
of
right
now
and
right
here
as
i
said
ive
had
good
experiences
from
mushrooms
easing
my
headaches
and
i
was
also
well
aware
how
ergot
was
used
in
treatment
of
migrane
the
structural
similarities
between
all
of
these
compounds
are
obvious
to
anyone
when
comparing
them
side
by
side
i
carefully
considered
what
the
worst
thing
that
might
happen
could
be
this
was
not
all
too
obvious
as
i
was
unsure
if
the
headache
would
affect
my
trip
in
a
negative
way
i
decided
to
go
for
it

at
this
point
i
was
in
some
pain
i
had
problems
keeping
my
eyes
open
due
to
the
fact
that
it
hurt
to
look
at
things
sounds
were
slightly
distorted
and
amplified
the
pipe
was
loaded
with
30mg
and
handed
to
me
i
emptied
the
pipe
in
one
huge
breath
and
laied
down
on
the
couch
what
happends
next
still
baffles
me
right
before
i
enter
hyperspace
i
feel
something
snap
in
my
forehead
and
just
like
that
my
headache
is
gone
not
just
dulled
away
by
drugs
but
actually
completely
gone
the
experience
itself
was
not
affected
by
this
at
all
although
i
would
still
advice
anyone
attempting
anything
similar
to
use
caution
and
the
headache
didnt
return
when
the
experience
ended
ill
definitely
try
this
again
when
the
circumstances
are
ok




roughly
two
years
ago
i
took
my
last
trip
with
research
chemicals
by
the
time
i
had
got
to
that
point
i
had
done
my
fair
share
of
research
chemicals
since
i
had
it
in
ample
supply
i
had
done
2c-i
2c-e
2ct-7
and
2ct-2
all
with
trips
ranging
from
the
boring
to
the
extremely
pleasant
i
never
had
had
a
bad
trip
or
negative
after
effects
excluding
fatigue
the
next
day
besides
research
chemicals
i
had
done
other
psychedelics
lsd
mushrooms
and
5-meo
dmt
with
the
same
results

the
reason
i
mention
this
is
because
by
the
time
i
had
begun
experiencing
with
psychedelics
i
had
been
diagnosed
with
major
depressive
disorder
and
generalized
anxiety
disorder
and
had
been
prescribed
lexapro
the
lexapro
actually
did
wonders
for
me
curtailing
significantly
my
depression
and
anxiety
to
the
point
where
i
felt
fine
so
before
i
began
experimenting
with
psychedelics
i
read
what
possible
effects
it
could
have
on
my
mental
health
i
read
that
it
could
exacerbate
my
depression
and
anxiety
so
i
started
out
slow
and
no
such
thing
happened
to
me
i
felt
fine
and
enjoyed
my
trips
usually
before
i
tripped
i
would
not
take
my
prescribed
lexapro
the
day
before
so
i
could
feel
the
psychedelics
more
this
was
true
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
of
psychedelic
usage

then
one
night
i
decided
to
take
2c-i
which
by
then
was
a
common
thing
with
my
friend
i
took
25
mg
and
went
to
another
friends
house
to
hang
out
when
i
got
there
someone
offered
me
25
mg
of
2c-e
and
i
took
it
without
thinking
too
much
about
it
the
trip
was
usual
interesting
and
fun
with
lots
of
visuals
until
the
very
end
i
started
to
become
a
bit
overwhelmed
by
the
constant
visuals
everything
was
moving
and
nothing
was
staying
still
i
also
started
getting
a
feeling
that
i
was
passing
some
threshold
some
indescribable
place
in
my
mind
that
i
didnt
want
to
go
to
but
i
was
regardless
of
what
i
wanted
i
felt
uncomfortable
but
not
enough
to
make
a
fuss
about
it


after
the
effects
went
away
i
got
a
horrible
headache
that

would
not
go
away
and
i
couldnt
sleep
for
hours
but
when
i
finally
did
i
slept
the
whole
next
day
when
i
got
up
i
felt
fine
i
went
into
the
shower
to
get
ready
for
school
but
as
i
was
showering
i
got
a
familiar
feeling
that
i
had
not
gotten
in
a
year
or
so
it
was
panic
i
was
panicking
about
nothing
like
i
had
in
high
school
i
started
having
anxiety
attacks
that
night
i
called
my
cousin
to
smoke
me
out
to
see
if
pot
would
calm
my
nerves
as
i
was
smoking
my
vision
got
spotty
black
dots
began
to
fill
my
vision
and
i
almost
passed
out
i
threw
up
a
little
when
i
got
out
of
the
car
we
were
smoking
in


from
than
on
for
like
3
months
i
had
to
struggle
with
my
anxiety
and
depression
once
again
i
eventually
got
it
in
control
but
never
to
the
same
level
i
had
when
i
had
first
started
taking
lexapro
i
also
avoided
all
psychedelics
except
for
marijuana
even
though
sometimes
it
did
cause
anxious
episodes
for
me
but
for
the
most
part
it
calmed
me
down

my
abstinence
of
all
psychedelics
ended
two
months
ago
my
friend
got
a
hold
of
lsd
and
since
lsd
was
my
favorite
psychedelic
i
decided
to
see
if
i
could
handle
it
i
tried
it
and
once
again
i
had
a
wonderful
trip
it
was
fun
and
i
enjoyed
myself
greatly
unfortunately
the
next
day
my
anxiety
started
acting
up
again
and
i
felt
anxious
for
two
weeks
to
an
unusual
and
uncomfortable
degree
i
told
myself
that
was
it
and
i
had
to
come
to
grips
that
even
though
psychedelics
were
enjoyable
to
me
i
could
not
take
them


that
was
until
another
friend
offered
me
dmt
the
amount
i
smoke
wasnt
a
lot
at
all
i
did
not
have
an
overwhelming
all
encompassing
experience
that
i
have
read
about
but
i
did
feel
it
i
smoked
what
she
had
left
over
that
did
not
cause
post
trip
anxiety
but
it
could
have
been
the
fact
i
did
not
smoke
that
much


since
that
i
have
not
done
any
other
psychedelics
excluding
the
mild
psychedelic
that
is
marijuana
and
im
committed
to
not
doing
them
anymore
because
i
dont
want
to
risk
exacerbating
my
depression
or
anxiety
even
they
have
provided
me
some
incredibly
enjoyable
and
beautiful
experiences




my
friend
had
done
dmt
in
his
vaporizer
the
night
before
and
didnt
clean
out
the
bag
well
he
warned
me
but
i
was
under
the
misapprehension
that
dmt
trips
only
last
for
ten
minutes
so
i
wasnt
worried
they
do
but
i
guess
when
you
mix
strange
things
can
happen


long
story
short
i
was
extremely
paranoid
of
police
and
of
this
awful
feeling
being
permanent
the
feeling
was
basically
a
lack
of
control
i
felt
a
disconnect
from
my
nervous
system
any
task
seemed
impossibly
complex
i
could
only
operate
on
what
i
repeatedly
referred
to
as
muscle
memory
auto
pilot
anything
i
put
conscious
effort
into
was
awkward
and
inarticulate
like
a
baby
walking
for
the
first
time
including
trying
to
explain
how
i
felt
to
my
friend
or
even
just
picking
up
a
glass
off
the
table
my
friend
took
care
of
me
made
sure
i
ate
and
drank
the
other
odd
effect
was
a
burning
and
tickling
in
my
throat
that
i
get
everytime
i
use
a
vaporizer
it
made
eating
and
drinking
breathing
and
swallowing
very
weird
i
hate
it
and
it
was
worse
than
ever
that
night
i
came
down
around
2
hours
later
it
wasnt
the
worst
feeling
of
my
life
but
the
dmt
added
nothing
positive
i
was
really
really
high
from
the
marijuana
probably
the
highest
i
have
ever
been
but
i
dont
attribute
that
to
the
dmt
ive
never
tried
dmt
on
its
own
but
if
youre
going
to
do
dmt
do
a
lot
of
it
and
dont
mix
it
that
would
be
my
advice




i
have
tried
dmt
quite
a
few
times
including
ayahuasca
however
this
particular
time
was
unique
i
like
smoking
it
in
a
small
group
with
attention
to
set
and
setting

i
like
smoking
it
in
a
small
group
with
attention
to
set
and
setting

a
conversation
about
it
before
the
experience
is
very
important
to
create
a
good
and
safe
environment
as
well
as
to
show
respect
to
the
substance

in
this
occasion
we
were
three
generally
while
one
is
gone
the
other
two
wait
quietly
for
the
person
to
come
back
the
person
then
describes
the
experience
which
is
recorded
to
a
voice
recorder
in
case
the
person
decides
to
hear
it
later
on
i
had
a
nice
bag
of
changa
dmt
crystal
mixed
with
flower
petals
to
make
it
easier
to
burn
through
the
pipe
we
dimmed
the
lights
from
the
house
leaving
just
enough
light
to
recognise
the
place
a
big
sarong
is
on
the
wall
with
a
well
designed
mandala
right
in
front
of
us
a
thin
mattress
a
pillow
and
a
blanket
are
ready
to
be
used
we
fill
the
pipe
with
changa
push
it
down
a
bit
and
light
up
the
lighter
burn
it
as
we
start
smoking
as
much
smoke
as
we
can
take
in
trying
to
burn
all
the
content
in
the
pipe
in
one
go

the
first
person
to
go
was
me
as
soon
as
i
couldnt
take
any
more
smoke
in
a
sense
of
heaviness
swept
my
body
all
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
lie
down
which
i
did
on
the
mattress
with
the
comfortable
pillow
pulled
the
blanket
over
me
and
just
relaxed

incredible
psychedelic
patterns
started
to
form
there
is
no
form
nothing
is
well
defined
instead
everything
is
morphing
into
something
new
colours
and
shapes
are
constantly
changing
and
this
is
the
only
describable
characteristic
of
the
visuals
my
body
is
completely
relaxed
and
i
dont
feel
i
am
in
it

from
the
fractals
and
psychedelia
i
can
see
a
figure
it
has
a
head
arms
and
legs
it
knows
that
i
am
present
and
looks
at
me
his
face
is
not
human
his
is
wearing
a
gas
mask
and
his
looks
reminds
me
of
me
the
movie
predator
but
his
is
wearing
a
headphone
too
the
alien
starts
moving
his
arm
in
the
same
frequency
as
the
movement
of
the
background
shapes
as
if
he
was
dancing
to
it
he
stares
at
me
coming
closer
to
me
but
moves
backwards
again
when
he
moves
his
arms
and
points
to
the
side
as
in
telling
me
to
look
to
the
right
the
background
shapes
merge
into
a
gradient
of
yellow
orange
and
red
i
look
to
the
right
but
i
notice
i
am
floating
and
i
dont
have
a
body
i
see
a
book
that
is
turning
pages
on
its
own
i
hover
over
the
book
as
the
pages
turn
to
stop
at
a
particular
page
where
i
could
see
a
city
i
hovered
over
the
page
flying
through
it
as
if
the
book
is
a
portal
or
a
gate
to
the
city


the
city
is
purely
golden
and
it
looked
like
manhattan
or
a
place
with
lots
of
high-rises
there
is
no
details
or
texture
everything
is
defined
by
the
contrast
in
the
gradient
between
yellow
orange
and
red
i
can
see
people
walking
and
their
body
resemble
the
souls
from
the
movie
cocoon
from
the
90s
i
notice
that
as
soon
as
i
am
in
the
city
hundreds
of
beings
acknowledge
my
presence
there
but
continue
walking
or
doing
what
they
were
doing
i
can
see
an
entire
civilisation
as
i
fly
higher
above
the
buildings
this
knowing
comes
in
telling
me
that
it
is
zion
a
city
in
the
future
i
get
emotional
and
i
decide
to
open
my
eyes
patterns
and
shapes
merge
with
shapes
in
the
room
as
if
they
were
in
the
same
place
the
mandala
is
moving
and
morphing
its
design
i
close
my
eyes
and
the
patterns
are
stronger
so
i
stay
there
just
watching
its
beauty
when
i
open
my
eyes
the
room
becomes
clearer
i
try
to
move
my
body
and
the
patterns
start
to
dissolve
i
can
notice
the
details
of
the
room
which
are
quickly
getting
more
defined
i
try
to
remain
with
my
eyes
shut
but
things
are
not
as
clear
physical
reality
is
stronger
i
sit
up
and
decide
to
share
my
experience
with
my
friends


i
have
had
other
experiences
where
i
saw
lots
of
psychedelic
patterns
but
i
had
never
being
welcomed
or
hosted
by
another
being
in
hyperspace
it
took
me
some
time
to
stop
thinking
about
it
i
wanted
to
go
back
there
and
i
tried
other
times
but
no
one
showed
up

just
the

psychedelia
which
is
beautiful
to
watch


this
was
on
of
the
most
profound
experiences
in
my
life
i
am
confident
there
is
another
realm
of
existence
where
beings
are
living
a
non-biological
life
it
has
been
nearly
3
years
since
this
experience
but
if
i
close
my
eyes
i
can
still
see
images
from
that
place
and
the
alien
that
welcomed
me
just
as
much
i
can
recall
any
other
memory




i
recently
went
to
a
music
festival
and
on
the
last
night
at
the
flaming
lips
set
a
girl
i
met
asked
if
id
like
to
smoke
dmt
with
her
and
her
friends

i
told
her
i
was
hesitant
what
i
knew
about
dmt
is
that
its
incredibly
intense

on
dmt
people
leave
reality
as
we
know
it
visit
other
dimensions
and
meet
mystical
or
divine
beings
-
not
something
i
felt
prepared
for
let
alone
at
a
festival

my
new
friend
assured
me
it
was
mild
because
it
was
in
a
joint
and
that
she
would
be
right
by
my
side

i
was
still
nervous
and
i
hadnt
ever
heard
of
dmt
joints
but
i
trusted
her

i
hesitated
then
decided
what
the
hell

this
was
the
first
time
id
had
this
opportunity
and
it
could
easily
be
the
last

her
friends
passed
the
joint
around
and
when
it
came
to
me
i
took
a
tiny
puff

it
tasted
like
spicy
incense
mixed
with
something
chemical

i
felt
my
body
tingle
similar
to
the
beginning
of
an
acid
trip

i
felt
my
body
tingle
similar
to
the
beginning
of
an
acid
trip


as
they
continued
passing
the
joint
i
took
two
more
hits

as
i
exhaled
the
third
i
was
launched
into
a
different
version
of
reality

for
a
moment
the
world
around
me
seemed
to
bounce
and
then
everything
turned
into
fractals

on
other
psychedelics
i
tend
to
have
fewer
visuals
than
other
people
but
on
this
drug
wow

all
of
the
people
around
me
the
stage
and
the
sky
became
complex
patterns
of
colors
and
shapes

my
surroundings
looked
completely
different
but
i
still
recognized
them

i
felt
as
though
i
was
seeing
the
true
reality
and
that
normal
reality
is
just
a
projection
of
that

i
could
see
peoples
auras

i
looked
at
my
friend
and
saw
that
she
was
more
colorful
than
any
of
the
other
people
around

she
was
so
beautiful

her
glasses
and
her
eyes
were
made
out
of
flowers
made
out
of
smaller
flowers
made
out
of
smaller
flowers

i
felt
that
if
i
leaned
in
closer
i
would
be
able
to
see
the
infinitely
smaller
flowers
but
i
was
afraid
of
falling
into
her
eyes
and
not
being
able
to
get
out

one
of
her
friends
took
another
hit
and
as
he
exhaled
i
saw
the
smoke
go
directly
into
my
nostrils
as
if
it
intended
to
do
so

that
second
hand
smoke
sent
me
to
another
level
for
a
moment

the
fractals
became
so
complex
i
didnt
recognize
what
they
represented
anymore

i
wasnt
sure
where
i
was
and
i
started
to
feel
disoriented
and
frightened

the
fractals
continued
becoming
more
and
more
intricate
and
i
became
overwhelmed
as
i
realized
that
my
perspective
was
rapidly
zooming
out
and
that
i
was
beginning
to
see
the
whole
universe
at
once

somehow
i
was
still
aware
that
i
had
taken
a
drug
and
i
started
to
think
i
shouldnt
have

i
closed
my
eyes
and
the
intensity
subsided

when
i
opened
them
everything
was
still
fractals
but
i
was
back
with
my
friend
at
the
flaming
lips
show

the
lips
began
to
play
the
yeah
yeah
yeah
song
and
i
began
to
dance

what
an
amazing
thing
it
was
to
dance

i
had
momentarily
left
my
body
and
now
i
was
back

i
once
heard
someone
alan
watts
maybe
say
that
we
are
the
universe
made
aware
of
itself
and
that
is
exactly
how
i
felt

i
realized
that
everything
is
one
that
we
are
not
in
the
universe
but
rather
part
of
it

everything
is
atoms
and
my
atoms
just
so
happened
against
infinitesimal
odds
to
arrange
themselves
into
the
shape
of
this
body
with
a
brain
that
gives
me
consciousness


i
was
so
happy
and
grateful
to
be
alive
to
be
the
awareness
of
the
universe

i
have
a
body

i
can
dance

i
was
completely
euphoric
and
as
i
danced
i
felt
an
electric
energy
move
up
my
spine

my
spine
turned
into
a
snake
that
i
could
feel
moving
on
its
own
accord

i
was
confused
how
this
could
happen
but
it
didnt
bother
me

the
snake
and
i
danced
together
as
energy
surged
up
through
my
body
to
the
top
of
my
head
and
i
tried
to
sort
out
what
i
was

i
decided
that
i
was
a
spiritual
being
temporarily
inhabiting
a
physical
form
and
that
my
body
was
the
greatest
gift
i
could
possibly
receive

at
some
point
the
band
played
feeling
yourself
disintegrate

more
than
once
ive
heard
this
song
on
acid
and
laughed
out
loud
at
how
appropriate
it
was

when
i
heard
it
this
time
though
it
didnt
seem
funny
or
coincidental
it
seemed
like
the
only
possible
thing
that
could
happen

if
i
were
ever
to
smoke
dmt
of
course
wayne
coyne
would
be
there
performing
this
song
live

the
effects
wore
off
gradually

i
was
no
longer
seeing
everything
in
fractals
but
i
continued
to
see
some
here
and
there
for
the
rest
of
the
night

when
i
got
home
from
the
festival
i
couldnt
stop
thinking
about
my
experience
and
what
it
meant


i
read
erowids
article
on
dmt
and
discovered
that
w
what
i
smoked
was
almost
certainly
changa

i
think
my
brief
overwhelming
peak
was
just
a
glimpse
of
what
pure
dmt
is
like
and
i
feel
convinced
now
that
i
probably
never
want
to
do
that

also
im
on
zoloft
an
ssri
and
it
scared
me
to
read
that
changa
contains
an
maoi

im
very
grateful
that
it
didnt
seem
to
have
any
negative
effect
on
me



next
i
got
to
researching
the
snake
thing

it
was
so
real
i
can
still
recall
how
it
felt

i
hardly
know
anything
about
chakras
but
i
vaguely
remembered
that
one
of
them
is
represented
as
a
snake
so
i
googled
chakras
snake

that
led
me
to
the
wikipedia
article
on
kundalini
which
when
i
read
it
blew
my
mind


kundalini
is
the
lowest
chakra
a
coil
of
energy
at
the
base
of
the
spine

its
represented
as
a
sleeping
serpent
and
some
people
practice
specific
types
of
yoga
and
meditation
to
try
to
awaken
it


as
i
read
through
the
article
i
realized
that
kundalini
awakening
is
exactly
what
happened
to
me

it
feels
crazy
to
think
about
because
i
tend
to
be
skeptical
of
mystical
events
but
i
know
without
a
doubt
thats
what
i
experienced

coincidentally
i
had
just
done
some
yoga
earlier
that
day
for
the
first
time
in
months
i
wonder
if
that
somehow
contributed
to
my
kundalini
awakening

i
dont
generally
believe
that
things
happen
for
a
reason
but
it
feels
very
much
like
i
was
meant
to
have
this
experience

i
think
about
the
odds
that
i
would
meet
someone
who
would
offer
me
this
drug
about
the
second
hand
smoke
i
saw
go
directly
into
my
nose
and
about
feeling
yourself
disintegrate
and
it
just
doesnt
seem
random

i
dont
really
know
where
to
go
from
there
but
the
whole
thing
has
inspired
me
to
start
meditating
again
to
get
back
into
yoga
and
to
explore
the
more
spiritual
aspects
of
yoga

the
whole
thing
has
inspired
me
to
start
meditating
again
to
get
back
into
yoga
and
to
explore
the
more
spiritual
aspects
of
yoga

since
ive
previously
only
done
it
for
the
exercise



taking
such
a
powerful
drug
from
someone
i
just
met
and
in
public
was
a
big
risk
but
im
incredibly
grateful
that
i
did






i
apologize
in
advance
for
the
length
of
this
report
-
it
it
did
not
last
very
long
but
the
experience
itself
is
something
that
i
feel
needs
to
be
shared
with
others
who
are
planning
to
try
dmt
for
their
first
time


past
drug
experience
mdma

shrooms

lsd
alcohol

myself
and
two
of
my
best
friends
had
gotten
our
hands
on
200mg
of
very
pure
dmt
we
had
been
waiting
to
get
some
for
months
and
now
was
finally
the
time
we
were
in
a
dimly
lit
basement
in
a
very
relaxed
state
of
mind
we
had
no
scale
so
we
figured
wed
just
load
up
a
bongful
of
the
crystals
and
take
it
from
there
boy
was
that
a
huge
mistake

we
had
no
scale
so
we
figured
wed
just
load
up
a
bongful
of
the
crystals
and
take
it
from
there
boy
was
that
a
huge
mistake



my
friend
l
went
first
he
lit
the
crystals
waited
for
our
homemade
bong
to
fill
up
with
smoke
there
wasnt
much
and
he
removed
the
cap
and
inhaled
he
ran
to
the
bed
and
waited
in
anticipation
he
closed
his
eyes
searching
for
any
sign
of
visuals
but
found
none
it
just
feels
kinda
weird
he
said
disappointed
he
took
another
hit
but
again
no
real
effect

i
was
slightly
frustrated
and
figured
he
must
be
doing
something
wrong
so
i
tried
a
hit
myself
i
sat
crosslegged
on
the
floor
as
my
other
friend
h
lit
a
freshly
packed
bowl
of
crystals
the
smoke
filled
up
a
bit
and
he
removed
the
cap
for
me
i
sucked
all
the
smoke
in
very
fast
and
tried
holding
it
in
for
as
long
as
i
could
3
seconds
before
coughing
it
all
out
as
i
was
coughing
it
out
the
room
was
flashing
different
colors
and
warping
very
intensely
the
walls
were
skewing
and
moving
right
before
my
eyes
overwhelmed
i
crawled
onto
a
nearby
recliner
so
i
could
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
trip

holy
shit
i
kept
saying
out
loud
i
was
hallucinating
shadows
on
the
wall
that
looked
like
the
links
of
a
fence
the
room
would
go
from
purple
to
green
to
red
all
within
a
couple
of
seconds
this
is
really
tripping
me
out
i
said
laughing
but
thats
when
it
hit
me
the
most
intense
body
load
ive
ever
felt


my
heart
was
racing
easily
over
170
beats
per
minute
-
far
beyond
the
medical
threshold
for
tachycardia
i
could
not
move
any
of
my
limbs
i
was
paralyzed
from
head
to
toe
i
started
shitting
myself
not
literally
and
decided
i
needed
to
go
to
the
er
but
i
didnt
want
to
scare
my
friends
i
figured
i
just
had
to
wait
it
out
as
badly
as
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
hospital
i
knew
that
wasnt
an
option
i
told
my
friends
that
i
was
freaking
out
and
i
couldnt
handle
this
i
remember
acknowledging
the
fact
that
i
was
going
to
die
there
was
absolutely
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
i
was
going
to
die
from
a
dmt
overdose
on
this
old
recliner
my
parents
would
be
so
proud
i
was
about
to
ask
one
of
my
friends
to
stab
me
so
i
could
skip
this
overwhelming
trepidation
i
was
experiencing
the
visuals
were
starting
to
really
scare
me
so
i
closed
my
eyes
my
friends
tried
calming
me
down
but
their
voices
sounded
really
panicked
so
it
was
making
me
feel
worse
i
told
my
friend
l
to
come
massage
my
back
because
i
thought
it
would
help
me
regain
feeling
in
my
body
i
felt
bad
because
he
was
still
having
a
light
trip
so
my
demands
for
a
massage
probably
stressed
him
out
a
bit
but
i
really
needed
it
i
took
deep
breaths
and
silently
prayed
to
god
for
a
few
minutes
im
agnostic
mind
you
the
massage
helped
but
during
this
time
my
dumbass
friend
h
was
lighting
a
new
bowl
for
himself


dude
i
honestly
wouldnt
do
that
if
i
were
you
i
said
coming
down
i
just
had
the
worst
trip
of
my
life
he
didnt
care
and
inhaled
his
hit
but
like
my
other
friend
he
felt
no
effects
l
stopped
massaging
me
and
packed
another
bowl
you
guys
i
began
to
warn
them
again
you
dont
understand
the
things
i
just
saw
why
are
you
smoking
more
i
was
completely
baffled
at
my
friends
willingness
to
smoke
more
of
something
that
almost
ended
my
life
regardless
they
both
smoked
more
claiming
they
wanted
to
get
where
i
was
dumb
fuckers

nothing
happened
to
them
thank
god
but
something
about
this
drug
really
affected
me
i
suspect
that
i
have
an
adverse
reaction
to
the
drug
because
i
have
several
enzyme
deficiencies
either
that
or
i
just
smoked
waaay
too
much
i
didnt
break
through
however
which
leads
me
to
believe
that
this
drug
simply
will
not
work
with
my
body
i
do
not
plan
on
trying
it
again
and
if
you
ever
asked
me
personally
about
dmt
i
would
say


stay
very
far
away
from
it

it
almost
killed
me
